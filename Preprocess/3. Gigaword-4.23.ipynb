      " \"The government is looking at helping overseas Filipino workers (OFW) in Taiwan to buy houses in the Philippines, \" said Fabiana. To this end, \"we are holding the first overseas Housing Fair in Taiwan. Later we will hold other Housing Fairs in Dubai and London.\" \n",
      " The fair, held at the Dominican School in Taipei, was the first of its kind organized outside the Philippines by the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) and the Pag-IBIG Fund. \n",
      " According to information released by the MECO, the Housing Fair is a coordinated effort by government agencies such as the Pag-IBIG Fund, the Landbank of the Philippines (LBP) , Philippine Health Insurance Corp. and the Philippine Labor and Employment Office. \n",
      " Pag-IBIG Fund is one of the Philippines government's leading housing agencies. \n",
      " The event in Taipei also featured booths set up by the LBP with the aim of providing an inexpensive service to workers in Taiwan who send remittances to the Philippines. \n",
      " Fabiana said that many overseas Filipino workers (OFW) dream of building a new house for their loved ones. \"We hope to help make their dream come true by hosting this Housing Fair in Taipei, \" said Fabiana. \"We provide housing loans at rates as low as 6%.\" \n",
      " \"I think the interest rates for the housing loans are quite low,\" said Silva Moonyen Ortiz, a Filipina who has been working in Taiwan for three years. \n",
      " The fair attracted many OFWs residing in areas of northern Taiwan such as Taoyuan, Jhongli, Hsinchu and Keelung. \n",
      " According to the MECO, there are 85,000 Filipinos in Taiwan and all of them are trying hard to provide for their families in the Philippines. \n",
      " The housing fair will serve as venue for OFWs and developers to meet and will also facilitate arrangements for the housing projects to be tailor-made to the OFWs' needs and requirements, the MECO said. \n",
      " Most of the housing projects will be affordable and OFWs at the housing fair will be able to chose from among projects in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, it added. \n",
      " Pag-ibig Fund is the Philippines government's Home Development Mutual Fund that was created in 1978 to offer savings schemes and housing loan packages to Filipinos. It includes an overseas program, which offers Filipino overseas contract workers, immigrants and naturalized citizens an opportunity to save for the future and to access a housing loan of as much as 2 million Philippines pesos. \n",
      " Philippine citizens working overseas can join the Pag-IBIG overseas program by first applying for membership and paying the required monthly contributions. \n",
      " Last month, Pag-IBIG officials flew to Taiwan to promote the fund's housing projects among OFWs in Taipei, Taichung in central Taiwan, and the southern port city of Kaohsiung. The Pag-IBIG Fund delegation  visited factories and dormitories  where they gave presentations on the programs and services being offered to OFWs. \n",

      " Some of Nan Shan's 37,000 sales staff have staged several street rallies  to demand protection  of their work rights over the controversial sale. \n",
      " Wedding Lan, a spokesman for Nan Shan's labor union, told CNA in a telephone interview that he welcomed the government's rejection of the proposed sale. \n",
      " He added that if any new buyers come forward, they should abide by the law and protect the rights of Nan Shan clients and employees. \n",

      "Taiwan can expand its diplomatic horizons, regardless of obstacles put in its way by China, ROC President Chen Shui-bian said Friday in Abu Dhabi. \n",

      " Chen, at the head of a group of high-ranking officials and business leaders, arrived in the UAE capital earlier in the day for a 29-hour transit stop on his way back to Taiwan after a 13-day visit to the ROC's diplomatic allies in Central America and the Caribbean. \n",
      " Noting that he was deeply touched that ROC national flags were flying upon his arrival at the international airport of the UAE, a country which is not the ROC's diplomatic ally, the president said that he wanted to thank the Arabian nation. \n",
      " \"I was really moved to see ROC national flags flying over the airport, particularly given that China has never stopped trying to prevent Taiwan from joining the international community and strengthening its relations with other countries,\" Chen said. \n",
      " According to the president, although Beijing protested strongly to the UAE about his stopover, the protest was ignored since the UAE has what he said are its own principles and methods to deal with the matter. \n",
      " \"Some say that this is a very significant breakthrough in relations between Taiwan and the UAE... I'll treasure this,\" he said. \n",

      " \"Taiwan still can act in various places around the world as there are many issues that the island can raise and discuss with other nations, \" he also said. \"Taiwan can start down the road to success only if it makes a concerted effort.\" \n",
      " The president also said that his transit stop in Abu Dhabi is \"a very important visit\" as many high-ranking ROC officials who were accompanying him, including Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, were to hold bilateral talks with their UAE counterparts on the strengthening of economic, trade and investment cooperation between the two countries. \n",
      " Chen also rebutted media reports that said that he had lied when he said he was going to stop over in San Francisco; adding, however, \"Even if it was a lie, it was one of goodwill.\" \n",
      " Reporters were told that the president planned to fly to San Francisco rather than Abu Dhabi for a stopover on his way back to Taiwan Oct. 1. \n",
      " Claiming that he did not lie to the media or to the public, the president said that he hopes that the media can understand that as a head of state, he was not able to confirm any information when matters related to his transit stopover in a country with no diplomatic relations with Taiwan were still being arranged. \n"

      "Taiwan's exports to Europe will likely drop in the short term after the introduction on Friday of the European Union's single currency, the euro, the island's top economic planner said. \n",
      " European countries supporting the euro will temporarily increase their purchases among each other and reduce imports from outside the euro-zone resulting in lesser Taiwan exports to Europe, said P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD). \n",
      " This \"conversion effect\" will adversely affect Taiwan exports for a short period of time. In the long run, he said, the launch of the euro will boost overall economic and trade growth in Europe, which will in turn fuel domestic demand and increase imports from outside areas. That will consequently result in increased purchases from Taiwan, Chiang added. \n",
      " In the future, Taiwan businesses -- some of which have raised funds in Europe -- can expect to source even more bargaining funds from the euro-zone as the new common currency is seen to accelerate integration of the European financial markets, and long-term interest rates in that region are expected to be further lowered, Chiang said. \n",
      " To cope with the situation, China External Trade Development Council Secretary-General Kao Yi-hsin called for Taiwan exporters and manufacturers to open euro bank accounts in Europe or to convert their European bank accounts into euro. \n",
      " By doing so, Kao noted, Taiwan traders will find themselves in a more convenient position to conduct financial dealings, including equities, savings and loans, in Europe. \n",

      "Washington should seriously consider selling Taiwan long-range attack missiles so it can better deter the growing missile, air and naval forces of mainland China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), a U.S. military strategist said Thursday. \n",
      " To sustain a sufficient level of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan requires the greater air defense and antisubmarine capabilities of the Kidd class destroyer, as well as the even greater anti-aircraft and potential antimissile capabilities of the Aegis class destroyer, said Richard Fisher Jr., a senior fellow with the private nonprofit Jamestown Foundation. \n",
      " In his latest article carried in China Brief, a publication of the Jamestown Foundation, Fisher said the purchase by mainland China of two Russian Project 956EM Sovremenny class destroyers, with the contract being signed this Jan. 3 for delivery by 2006, highlights the continuing growth in the PLA's capability of putting military pressure on Taiwan. \n",
      " It is increasingly apparent that the \"center\" of the PLA's counter-Taiwan strategy will be its space-missile-air power combine, Fisher noted, pointing out that this might include support from airborne troops, which can decide the outcome of a conflict in a short period of time. \n",
      " The mainland Chinese naval forces, and especially its growing submarine forces, would be critical in a combined forces effort to stop the U.S. Navy from helping Taiwan. But if Beijing were to try subduing Taiwan by a naval blockade, then ships like the Sovremenny would assume a greater importance, wrote Fisher, the managing editor of China Brief. \n",
      " For general operations against Taiwan, Fisher analyzed, the PLA's goal would be to first strike Republic of China Navy at its ports with missiles, aircraft and special forces units. Surviving warships would then face a superior number of mainland Chinese submarines, strike aircraft, combat ships as well as numerous naval mines. \n",
      " The Sovremennys, with their 130mm naval guns, could either provide fire support for amphibious invasion forces or act as the leading edge in a blockade operation, said Fisher, who is a noted military strategist, particularly on the PLA. \n",
      " Concern in both Taipei and Washington about mainland China's first purchase of two Russian Project 956E Sovremenny class destroyers in 1996 is justified by the fact that Taiwan and perhaps even the U.S. Navy lack an effective defense against the ship's SS-N-22 Sunburn (3M-80E Moskit) supersonic anti-ship missile, Fisher said, adding that both of these Sovremennys are now assigned to mainland China's East Sea Fleet which faces Taiwan and Japan. \n",
      " For Taipei and Washington, mainland China's recent purchase of even more advanced models of the Russian-made Sovremenny serves to validate the Bush administration's decision last year to sell Taiwan U.S. Kidd class destroyers and eight new conventional submarines, Kidd said, noting that there is an even greater requirement for the submarines now to counter the new Sovremennys.: [649, 612, 611]\n",

      "Transparency, easy access and information examination are keys to a successful absentee voting system, the top Philippine diplomat in Taiwan said Wednesday as his office was gearing up for his country's presidential election in May. \n",

      " An estimated 600,000 registered voters or more -- including 15,000 in Taiwan -- among 3 million overseas Filipino workers around the world are expected to cast their votes under the absentee voting system, which includes both physical and postal voting, he said. \n",
      " Implementation of the absentee voting is sometimes difficult because voting has to take place in embassies or consulates, he said, noting that voters also have to travel and can probably only vote on their days off. \n",
      " \"The expected turnout in Taiwan will be a little more than 50 percent, while the global turnout is expected to be around 50 percent-60 percent, \" said Basilio. \n",

Therefore, he went on, Taipei prefers \"not to fix it if it is not broken.\" \n",

      " The ALPA-S is the only trade union in Singapore where members have to approve agreements struck by its executive committee. \n",
      " The government noted that the ALPA-S and the SIA management have had a troubled relationship, with protracted negotiations often resulting in deadlock. Between 1980 and this year, 25 disputes between the two sides had to go before the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for conciliation. \n",
      " This year, SIA management negotiated with the pilots' union as SARS hit the travel industry. The MOM and the Industrial Arbitration Court had to be called in to help settle the wage-cut package. However, after an agreement was reached, 55 percent of the ALPA-S members voted out the negotiating team. \n",
      " The government emphasized that both SIA management and the pilots must put the past behind them and start anew. It said SIA must improve its human resource management so that the emphasis is not entirely on the pilots and management has to pay competitive wages and incentives to staff. \n",
      " The government statement stressed that aviation is a key industry, pointing out that SARS, terrorism, low-cost airlines and other developments challenge Singapore's status as a premier air hub. \n",

      " Claiming that Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community, Wilder said: \"The position of the United States government is that the ROC, Republic of China, is an issue undecided, and it has been left undecided, as you know, for many, many years.\" \n",
      " In response, Wang said Taiwan's statehood is beyond question and will not change or be affected simply because of a foreign official's comments. \n",
      " The absence of formal diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the United States will also not undermine the reality that the Republic of China on Taiwan is an independent sovereign state, Wang said. \n",
      " As to Wilder's statement that the issue of Taiwan's push for a referendum on its U.N. bid is almost certain to be discussed during upcoming talks between U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao at next month's meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Wang said the United States should separately deal with its relations with Taiwan and China. \n",
      " It is hoped that talks between U.S. and Chinese heads of state will not affect mutually beneficial Taiwan-U.S. relations, Wang said. \n",
      " Wang said the MOFA will step up dialogue with U.S. authorities to have them comprehend that holding a referendum on whether to apply for the U.N. membership is a response to mainstream public opinion and has nothing to do with changing the status quo or move toward declaration of independence.: [852, 852, 755]\n",

      "The Taipei District Court ruled Thursday that former Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Ling-san should be tried as a suspect instead of being a mere witness in the case of the electronic toll collection (ETC) scandal. \n",
      " The court ruling was seen as a further blow to investigators and public prosecutors who have long been held in low esteem by the public for being terrified to prosecute the powerful even if there is sufficient evidence to indict them. \n",
      " In the same ruling, the court sentenced Soong Nai-wu, one of Lin's former secretaries, to 12 years in prison for taking bribes and leaking confidential government information other than national defense secrets during the Ministry of Transportation and Communications' bidding process to select a company to operate the ETC systems on Taiwan's freeways. \n",
      " Soong will also be deprived of his civil rights for eight years. He was accused of accepting more than NT$700,000 (US$21,590) in bribes and leaking secret MOTC documents to the contractor, Far Eastern Electronic Toll Collection Co., before the ETC bidding took place. \n",
      " The court also sentenced former Chingyeh Co. assistant manager Tsai Chin-hung to two years and six months' imprisonment for offering bribes to Soong, plus stripping him of his civil rights for one year. \n",
      " Soong indicated after the sentencing that he will appeal to the Taiwan High Court. Tsai could not be reached for comment. \n",
      " According to the ruling by the Taipei District Court, Tsai, who feared that public opinion was not favorable to Far Eastern's outdated infrared system at the time, suggested to Lin and Soong that they ask the MOTC's Institute of Transportation to put out a report recommending that the infrared system be adopted. \n",
      " Lin and Soong accepted Tsai's proposal and then had the requirements of the bidding process tailored according to Tsai's request to favor Far Eastern. They also provided the names of the members serving on the screening committee, along with other confidential information about the MOTC's procurement plans. \n",
      " In early August, the Administrative Supreme Court upheld the Administrative High Court's ruling that declared the government's partnership with Far Eastern void because the firm was unfairly favored during the bidding process for the project. \n"

      " He pointed out that the \"pan-green camp\" candidates in Tainan and Taichung cities have begun joint campaigning operations and that cooperation in the other three constituencies could begin immediately as the election situation there is not too complicated. \n",
      " Noting that \"it is not important for the 'pan-green camp' to have individual political stars, \" Lin said that although vote allocation might lead to some grievances among some candidates, the benefits to them in the long run are greater. \n",

      " Basic story: A group of mostly 20-something friends and family gathers on a small, secluded island near Seattle to celebrate the nuptials of real estate heiress Trish (Katie Cassidy) and her boyfriend of more modest means, Henry (Christopher Gorham). But before anyone's said \"I do,\" various degrees of decapitation and dismemberment ensue among the island's guests and longtime residents. The murders continue, one per episode, and everyone who's still alive is considered a suspect. \"Harper's Island\" is billed as a murder mystery but feels just as much like a prime-time CW soap opera -- think \"Scream\" meets \"One Tree Hill.\" \n",
      " What it faces: The series, which replaces the on-hiatus \"Eleventh Hour,\" is up against fellow newcomer \"Southland\" on NBC and \"Private Practice\" on ABC. \n",
      " What you'll love: \"Harper's Island\" only lasts 13 episodes (get it? 13!), so commitment-phobes will find it manageable. And those who've missed Gorham as prime-time's brawniest brainiac in \"Ugly Betty\" will be glad to see him return. (He's still a Henry, even!) \n",

      " It was a better week than usual for American foreign policy, and the administration put on a full-court, public-relations press to advertise this to Washington (and the world), and to paint the picture of a formidably competent foreign-policy president at the helm. \n",
      " It was predictable overstatement, but you can't blame the administration for trying, given that the president's record in this department has not been so exemplary or his general standing so high that he could afford to let the opportunity pass. \n",
      " When things of the world sag, presidents tend to sigh deeply and point to the iron constrictions of history and culture. When things pick up, they discern the magical possibilities of the human hand --  their own. \n",
      " Thus does President Clinton now cheerfully report that \"America's leadership\" is indispensable in this period of post-Cold War transition. \n",
      " The fact is that there has been some good news. Part of it is because the administration, after years of dithering, finally applied force and diplomacy to exploit a Bosnian opening that now has a fair chance of producing a political settlement before the onset of another harsh Balkan winter. \n",
      " The latest phase of Middle East negotiations happened to come to fruition at the same time, with the United States able to claim a helpful mediator's credit. \n",
      " The United States held steady when the Chinese overreacted on the sensitive Taiwan issue, and the Chinese seem to be easing off. Meanwhile, though apparently for their own reasons, the Chinese at least delayed a nuclear-reactor sale to Iran that Washington had protested, and they are resuming normal diplomatic contacts. \n",
      " The administration also has held steady in respect to Russia in the Balkans, and the Russians, having had a peacekeeping place offered to them, may now be adjusting to the new American assertiveness in that region. \n",
      " All these items, of course, come with their caveats. Bosnia is always only one bomb's burst away from a spike of crisis. No White House celebration can make the slogging easier in the Mideast. The United States is not yet near coming to terms with the larger role being claimed by a growing, pushier China. On the key issue of NATO expansion, Washington has far to go to reconcile its traditional interests in Europe and its revised interests in a reborn Russia. \n",
      " To be respectful of the dimensions of these and other international problems, however, is not to say they cannot be effectively addressed. The public, or the political public, wants not so much final results as an earnest application of competence and seriousness. \n",

      "A White House task force engaged in a ground-breaking effort to eliminate apparel industry sweatshops will propose the creation of an independent workplace monitoring system and international standards to address the problems of child labor and harassment. \n",
      " But the group, which has been studying the sweatshop issue for six months, remains deeply divided over the issue of minimal standards for wages and hours, sources close to the discussions say. \n",
      " The task force -- which includes business giants such as Nike and Liz Claiborne, unions, consumer groups and talk show host Kathie Lee Gifford -- is expected to present a full list of recommendations to the White House in February or early March. \n",
      " President Clinton is expected to endorse the group's proposals and urge major retail chains and apparel manufacturers to adopt the standards voluntarily for both domestic and foreign operations. The effort potentially could have a major impact on apparel industry working conditions worldwide. \n",
      " But the task force is far from an agreement on the critical issue of wages. Some members of the group argue that apparel manufacturers and their contractors should not be considered sweatshops if they pay the local miminum wage or prevailing wage. \n",
      " However, UNITE -- the apparel union member of the task force -- has favored setting minimums to ensure a \"living\" wage, said sources associated with the group. \n",
      " Similarly, the group has not yet reached a consensus on maximum working hours and the sticky issue of whether workers should be paid overtime. \n",
      " The task force has agreed that the public should be informed which companies are complying with the proposed standards. They have not, however, determined how to notify consumers of compliance. \n",
      " Some members favor a \"no sweat\" label that would be attached to a garment. Such a label would assure consumers that the product was made in compliance with international labor standards. The National Retail Federation has been critical of such an approach, suggesting that there is no way to ensure that each garment is made in compliance with such standards. \n",
      " However, the task force believes such assurances can be given if manufacturers agreed to independent inspection system. While such a system has been agreed in principle, it has not been determined who would carry out such inspections or how they would be financed. \n",
      " The task force has also agreed that no children younger than 14 should be employed in apparel plants, and that any kind of sexual or other harassment should be prohibited. Discrimination based on race, gender or nationality would also be barred under the proposed guidelines. \n",
      " The task force was formed following a spate of major scandals in the apparel industry. Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich sought volunteers for the task force and announced its formation on Aug. 2, 1996 -- exactly one year after government labor investigators liberated more than 60 Thai workers held in virtual slavery at a garment sweatshop in El Monte, Calif. \n",
      " The issue of sweatshops flared again when union activists discovered that children were employed by a Hondurous sewing contractor that produced clothing for Gifford's line of garments sold at Wal-Mart. \n",
      " The controversies have generated public concern about working conditions in the apparel industry, said Linda Golodner, co-chair of the task force and president of the Washington-based National Consumers League. \n"

He did not run for re-election as mayor in 1990, but ran as an independent for an at-large seat on the D.C. Council and lost. \n",

      " In what has become a rare phenomenon, a United States senator rose above partisan backbiting and interest-group pressures to support a Supreme Court nominee put forth by the other party. In casting his vote for Judge Sonia Sotomayor on Tuesday in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., struck a blow for comity, decency and intellectual honesty. \n",
      " \"You decided to vote for a man you would not have chosen,\" Graham said, referring to Democratic members of the committee who voted to confirm John Roberts, President George W. Bush's nominee for chief justice. \"I'm deciding to vote for a woman that I would not have chosen.\" \n",
      " Graham, the only Republican on the Senate panel to vote in favor of Sotomayor, said he was doing so because he concluded that she was qualified. Other Republican members also acknowledged her qualifications but voted no because of concerns over her alleged hostility to the Second Amendment and property rights, and the possibility that she would let her personal preferences supplant the law in rendering decisions. Never mind that Sotomayor repeatedly affirmed an individual's right to bear arms and proved during her 17-year tenure on the federal bench that she could separate her personal feelings from her professional duties as a judge. \n",
      " Graham's vote has a significance that transcends any single nominee. He was a member of the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group of senators that helped avert filibusters of judicial nominees during the Bush administration. He is standing by the same principles today even though a Democrat now occupies the White House. \"What I'm trying to do with my vote is to recognize that we came perilously close to damaging an institution, the judiciary, that has held this country together in difficult times,\" Graham added. \"The law should be a quiet place, where even the most unpopular can have a shot.\" \n",
      " Sotomayor's confirmation, which the full Senate is likely to take up next week, is not seriously in doubt; a handful of Republican senators have already announced their intention to join the majority Democrats in supporting her. More Republican senators should do likewise. Sotomayor may not be their nominee of choice, but as Graham has noted, elections have consequences.: [2987, 2934, 2886]\n",

      " \"The peoples of the Americas have a right to democracy and their governments have an obligation to promote and defend it.\" So reads the first sentence of the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which was adopted on Sept. 11, 2001, by the Organization of American States and signed by all 34 active member countries. Founded in 1948, the OAS defines its two top purposes as \"to strengthen peace and security on the continent\" and \"to promote and consolidate representative democracy.\" So with the organization's annual assembly set to open Tuesday in Honduras, you'd think a principal item of business would be the rapidly deteriorating political situation in Venezuela, where would-be strongman Hugo Chavez has ordered up criminal investigations against most of his leading opponents -- jailing one and driving another into exile -- and is threatening to shut down the last opposition broadcast television network. \n",
      " Not a chance. Far from facing the sanctions that the democratic charter authorizes, Chavez will be helping to lead a charge aimed at lifting the 1962 suspension of Cuba's OAS membership -- a campaign that enjoys the support of almost every government in the region. No, Cuba doesn't come close to meeting the requirements of the democratic charter -- in fact, its totalitarian domestic regime has remained essentially unaltered during the last 47 years. Nor do Raul and Fidel Castro wish to rejoin the OAS; like Chavez, the Castros would prefer to form a new regional organization that excludes the United States. \n",
      " Nonetheless, Latin American governments from Mexico to Argentina have chosen to make Cuba's readmission the centerpiece of this year's assembly. It's a cheap and popular way to please leftist constituencies at home -- and to pressure the Obama administration, which has unilaterally lifted several sanctions against Cuba but not what remains of the economic embargo. Sadly, even democratic governments such as Brazil and Chile are unwilling to stand by the pledge they made just eight years ago -- they, too, are clamoring to restore Cuba's membership while remaining silent about Venezuela. \n"

When that proposal failed to gain traction, U.S. diplomats joined a working group trying to hammer out a compromise. But most likely the administration is fighting an unwinnable battle.

      " Virginia's U.S. Senate race is all of two weeks old, and already the debate between the Republican incumbent, George Allen, and his Democratic rival, Jim Webb, has descended into a trench of cynicism and puerility. In the past few days we have been treated to a stomach-turning (if coded) squabble over patriotism and to one candidate mocking the other's middle name. These are not the bare-knuckled blasts of a tough electoral fight; this is blather masquerading as political dialogue. \n",
      " The aggressor and prime offender is Allen, who, through his campaign manager, Dick Wadhams, attacked Webb for opposing the flag-burning amendment that failed in the Senate. By bashing Webb for not \"protecting\" the flag, the Allen campaign sneakily impugned his patriotism. That's rich, since Webb, a secretary of the Navy under President Ronald Reagan and a highly decorated former Marine, is one of the more celebrated veterans of the Vietnam War -- \"a legendary fighting man,\" in the words of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Webb's campaign then fired back with a mocking broadside branding Wadhams and Allen -- \"George Felix Allen Jr.,\" as the statement called him -- as \"cowards.\" \n",
      " Ask Virginians to name the top 20 issues facing the state or the nation, and it's a good bet that the physical desecration of the flag and the patriotic bona fides of candidates for public office will not make the cut. Are Virginia voters really going to be subjected to five more months of blah, blah, blah about which candidate is the greater patriot or the more despicable coward? It's hard to imagine a more irrelevant debate or a campaign that would serve the public so poorly.: [3167, 3141, 3038]\n",

      " Syfy President David Howe said the network wants to bring in people who may not think of themselves as science fiction fans, but flock to movies such as \"Twilight\" and \"Star Trek.\" The network will not abandon its roots; instead, it will expand on a successful climb. In 2008, the Sci Fi Channel ranked No. 13 in total viewers among ad-supported cable networks, according to Nielsen Media Research, and has been a cash cow for parent company General Electric. \n",

      "Gov. Parris N. Glendening, calling the Chesapeake Bay blue crab a threatened part of Maryland's heritage, announced plans Thursday to ban all crabbing two days a week and to shorten the season this fall. \n",
      " Glendening said Maryland waters would be off limits to commercial and recreational crabbers on Wednesdays and Sundays. He called for the crabbing season to end Nov. 15 instead of Dec. 31, to stem a population decline by reducing the take of female crabs by one-fifth. \n",
      " Next year, Glendening said, he wants to ban crabbing one day a week and end the season Oct. 31. \n",
      " The changes would reduce the 1995 season by 63 days and the 1996 season by 91 days. \n",
      " Conservationists lauded and commercial watermen criticized Glendening's measures, which are to take effect Sept. 15 after a public hearing and review by a General Assembly committee. The panel can recommend changes but cannot block the new rules. \n",
      " Commercial watermen called the limits unfair unless Virginia watermen face similar restrictions and said they would be a major economic blow. \n",
      " \"It's a big hit,\" said Larry Simns, president of the Maryland Watermen's Association, which represents 10,000 to 15,000 commercial watermen, nearly all of whom crab. \"The net effect on the watermen is just like if you went into work tomorrow and the boss said, \"I'm going to pay you for three days instead of five.\"' \n",
      " Glendening, a Democrat, acknowledged that his measures would have little effect without cooperation from Virginia, which shares the crab. He said Virginia Gov. George Allen, a Republican, in a morning telephone conversation, \"pledged his continuous, full cooperation.\" \n",
      " Glendening said he discussed with Allen the possibility of Virginia joining Maryland in its prohibition of taking so-called sponge crabs, or females visibly bearing eggs. He said they also discussed Virginia's instituting a size limit on peelers, or crabs about to molt  -- a step Maryland took last year. \n",
      " Allen administration officials have said they expect Virginia, which bans crabbing on Sundays, to take no fresh action before late this month, if then. \n",
      " Glendening said it is important for Maryland to act quickly to prevent a population collapse similar to that suffered by the rockfish, which led the state to impose a moratorium on catching rockfish for nearly a decade. \n",
      " Biologists point to several signs that the bay's crab population might be headed for a collapse if pressure on the crustacean is not alleviated. One comprehensive survey shows the crab population down 34 percent since 1990, with the female crab's numbers off 47 percent. \n",
      " The autumn harvest of females, each of which may bear millions of eggs, is up sharply in Maryland, partly because watermen have been pursuing crabs harder and later in the season with the decline of other species. And surveys this summer by Maryland state biologists found fewer crabs in the bay than at any time in 10 years. \n",
      " William C. Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a conservation group, praised Glendening's plan: \"It's bold. It's immediate. We think it will be effective.\" \n",
      " Three weeks ago, the foundation proposed a deep-water sanctuary for the crabs, a plan that state officials said they still are considering. \n",
      " The crabbing industry, which had recommended less severe cuts in working hours, said Maryland's restrictions should be accompanied by parallel moves in Virginia. \n"

      "You'd figure there'd be some guys brooding and intense and all slouchy at the one cafe in this one-cafe burg in the brown hills 25 miles east of Paso Robles. \n",
      " After all, the Jack Ranch Cafe with its $16.95 rib-eye special is just half a mile down the road from the spot where James Dean died in a momentous wreck. And Dean was one of the greatest cinematic brooders of all time, even in a career composed of just three films. \n",
      " But on Friday, the 50th anniversary of his fatal accident, the only brooding in Cholame was being done by Scott Brim, a plastics salesman from Valencia who does a nice sideline in James Dean impersonations. \n",
      " The rest of the few hundred folks who ambled around at the 50th anniversary observance were mostly middle-aged Dean fans paying their respects, car nuts -- Dean was an aspiring racer -- and even a few old-timers who have untiringly recounted that day in 1955 for a generation or two of Dean aficionados. \n",
      " During the day, they hung around outside the cafe, where a rattlesnake warning is posted on a fence. Doo-wop songs blared over speakers, but the crowd at the free-form memorial tribute and car show was mainly quiet, waiting to mark the moment their idol breathed his last at 5:59 p.m. \n",
      " As the shadows grew and the air cooled, they trooped down to the very spot -- or at least as close as you could get to it before the roads were realigned a few years ago. Passing big-rig drivers tooted their horns. Motorists gaped at what was no doubt the largest crowd ever to mass around the intersection of Highways 41 and 46, smack in the middle of nowhere. \n",
      " Nothing much happened. People had their photos taken beside a new highway sign that says James Dean Memorial Junction. A couple of guys in silver Porsche Spyder 550s -- the model of car Dean was driving -- came down Highway 46, traveling the tail-end of the route he took that day from the Van Nuys district of Los Angeles. He was bound for a race in Salinas. \n",
      " After the moment, everyone slowly dispersed, drifting back to the cafe or to the cars parked for a quarter-mile on a side road. \n",
      " The observance is \"a Zen-type deal,\" said Warren Beath, a Dean biographer from Bakersfield. \"On this coast, no one has co-opted his death.\" \n",
      " Beath, interviewed earlier in the day, said he didn't think much of the annual festivities in Fairmount, Ind., where Dean spent much of his youth. \n",
      " In Fairmount, there are look-alike contests, souvenirs, parades -- virtually a revel without a pause. \n",
      " In Cholame, Ray Piacecki stood alone at the edge of the field where Dean's body lay when the ambulance got there. He was thumbing through the collected poems of the Hoosier bard James Whitcomb Riley -- one of Dean's favorite poets, he said. \n",
      " \"Only us true fans are here,\" said the customer-service representative from Atlanta as he surveyed the crowd. \"But (Bob) Dylan should be here. Dennis Hopper should be here. They owe him a lot.\" \n",
      " Outside the cafe, folks gathered at the parking-lot monument financed by Japanese fan Seita Ohnishi, savoring the lofty prose on its plaques: \n",
      " \"There are some things, like the hatred that accompanies war, that should be forgotten,\" he wrote. \"There are others, like the nobler qualities of Man, to which this young actor directed our attention, that should be preserved for all time.\" \n",
      " Penny Tingey, a retiree from Paso Robles who often takes out-of-towners to the monument, was among those who were not contemplating the nobler qualities of Man. \n",
      " \"He was the first person I ever heard called sex symbol,\" she said. \"I was 10 when he died, and things were just stirring. I remember seeing `Giant' at the drive-in with my parents, and thinking, `Wow! Who's that guy?' \" \n",
      " After his death, Dean was elevated to an almost spiritual prominence. There were rumors that he hadn't died at all, that he was in a sanitarium learning to use artificial limbs, that he hadn't even been in the car. His fatal accident was studied by a legion of amateur investigators with the intensity brought to the Kennedy assassination. \n",
      " Sitting on a lawn under a shade tree, 87-year-old Ron Nelson graciously obliged when asked by yet another stranger for his recollection of that fateful day. \n",
      " The retired California Highway Patrol officer said he and his partner were just coming off a coffee break in Paso Robles when they got the call. When he arrived, he saw Dean being loaded into an ambulance and breathing heavily -- a sign, he thought, of severe brain injury. \n",
      " The collision with Cal Poly student Donald Turnupseed was Turnupseed's fault, Nelson said. And Dean wasn't going 90 mph, as has been widely reported, Nelson said, figuring from the wreckage and the position of Dean's body that his speed was more like 55 mph. \n",
      " A big man in a Hawaiian shirt and a Panama hat, Nelson said he gets calls from all over the world when Sept. 30 rolls around. Reporters, biographers, avid fans all want his opinion. \n",

      "When the first of 304 potential jurors in the O.J Simpson case return to court later this month, they will face an exhaustive list of questions about their attitudes toward Simpson, the two people he is accused of killing, celebrities in general, domestic violence, DNA testing and interracial marriages. \n",
      " Contained within an unusual, 79-page jury questionnaire made public by the court on Friday will be 294 inquiries designed to test each potential juror's suitability for the celebrated trial. \n",
      " Questions will range from the mundane -- \"Do you seek out positions of leadership?\" -- to the provocative: \"Have you seen O.J. Simpson in any form of advertising, such as television commercials for Hertz Corp. or in orange juice advertisements?... What is your impression of Nicole Brown Simpson based upon what has been reported or published in the media?... Have you ever felt sufficiently frustrated within a domestic relationship that you considered violence?\" \n",
      " There is even a question asking whether the jury candidate owns any \"special knives.\" \n",
      " \"A person who himself owns a collection of knives is not going to think of themselves as violent,\" said University of California, Los Angeles, Law Professor Peter Arenella, who believes the question was devised by the defense to illicit attitudes potential jurors might have about people who own knife collections, as Simpson reportedly does. \n",
      " Those who do own such collectibles, Arenella said, probably \"would not draw any inference that Mr. Simpson would be violent merely because he owns knives.\" \n",
      " Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, who released blank copies of the questionnaire Friday, worked with lawyers from both the defense and prosecution to draft the document. Ito and the attorneys are expected to use the results to help select the 12 jurors and eight alternates who will hear the double-murder trial. \n",
      " Simpson has pleaded not guilty in the June 12 knife slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman outside her condominium. Prosecutors believe the murder weapon was a 15-inch German-made stiletto that they contend Simpson bought six weeks before the killings at a downtown Los Angeles cutlery store. \n",
      " In addition to the question about attitudes toward knives, the questionnaire seeks to explore -- much more extensively -- the jury candidates' attitudes toward the media, race and the type of DNA blood testing that prosecutors plan to use to connect the former football star to the murder scene. \n",
      " (Begin optional trim) \n",
      " A full 13 pages of questions -- representing one of the largest sections in the survey -- are devoted toward jurors' views of the media, including the tabloid press and television shows that are generally seen as more entertainment than journalism. \n",
      " \"Which of the following best describes how you would describe the media coverage overall?\" one question asks, offering answers that range from \"accurate\" to \"sometimes accurate-sometimes not\" to \"inaccurate.\" \n",
      " Jury consultants representing both the prosecution and defense have helped to tailor the questions to eliminate bias against one side or the other. The goal of prosecutors is to present questions designed to detect jurors who might have more sympathy than objectivity in weighing the fate of a man who has successfully spent his career cultivating a very likable image, experts noted. \n",
      " Defense attorneys, by contrast, would like to ferret out those who might have negative feelings toward Simpson based on race or other factors. A question about attitudes toward interracial marriage is seen by some experts as an attempt by the defense to identify jury candidates who might find such marriages offensive. \n",
      " (End optional trim) \n",
      " One question asks point-blank: \"How big a problem do you think racial discrimination against African-Americans is in Southern California?\" \n",
      " Questions about domestic violence are seen as important because information about O.J. Simpson's past physical abuse of Nicole Simpson could become evidence in the murder trial. Simpson pleaded no contest in 1989 to misdemeanor spousal abuse against his then-wife. \n",
      " Some, but not necessarily all, of the questions will be put to a batch of the prospective jurors scheduled to return to court Oct. 12 for the beginning of the \"voir dire,\" the portion of jury selection that seeks to screen out potential jurors who have made up their minds about the case, have biases against one side or another or who cannot set aside information they have gained from sources outside court. \n",
      " If necessary, a second group from the jury pool is expected to start voir dire on Oct. 17, and a third group on Oct. 24. \n",
      " If the entire pool of 304 potential jurors proves insufficient, Judge Ito will begin creating another pool. \n"

      " Twenty months after Hurricane Katrina, public housing residents of New Orleans remain scattered across the country. Many want to go home. They should be able to. But returning to the same squalid and dangerous housing projects that were isolated cauldrons of dysfunction and pathology is neither just nor humane. Katrina changed everything in the Crescent City, and its public housing must change, too. That's what the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is trying to make happen. But a lawsuit filed by the Advancement Project, a Washington-based civil rights organization, against federal, state and city officials is holding things up. \n",
      " New Orleans public housing before Hurricane Katrina was gripped by drug and gang activity, making the projects among the most dangerous areas in the city. Corruption and mismanagement led the federal government to take over the Housing Authority of New Orleans in 2002. HUD was in the process of redoing some of the public housing in the mode of HOPE VI developments that favor townhouse design and mixed-income residences over brick apartment buildings that warehouse the poor. Then Katrina hit. \n",
      " The Advancement Project lawsuit claims \"defendants' inaction and needless delay in repairing and reopening New Orleans' public housing development are based on racial animus and a clear intention to prohibit the return of many low-income African-American families.\" It demands a halt to HUD's planned demolition of troubled projects and a right of return for everyone to their old apartments in public housing. Unfortunately, comments by HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson (New Orleans \"is not going to be as black as it was for a long time, if ever again\"), Rep. Richard H. Baker, R-La. (\"We finally cleaned up public housing in New Orleans. We couldn't do it, but God did\") and New Orleans City Council President Oliver Thomas (\"We don't need soap-opera watchers all day\") served to fuel the conspiracy theories underpinning the lawsuit. They also roiled long-troubled racial waters in New Orleans. \n",
      " Judge Ivan Lemelle pushed aside the racial charges and denied an injunction against razing the housing projects. But a jury trial is set for Nov. 26, and Judge Lemelle has ordered the Advancement Project and HUD to try to settle before then. At stake is the transformation of four public housing projects built in the 1940s -- C.J. Peete, St. Bernard, B.W. Cooper and Lafitte -- from fortresses of concentrated poverty into mixed-income communities. The nonprofit developers of Lafitte, for instance, are doing just about everything the Advancement Project says it wants -- and what a House bill making its way to the Senate would mandate -- while at the same time following through on HUD's vision for renewed, reconnected and revitalized public housing that no longer isolates the poor. \n",
      " Enterprise Community Partners has committed to a one-for-one replacement of public housing units at Lafitte and to a right of return for former Lafitte residents. The developer has traveled to Houston and Baton Rouge to get residents' input. By renovating some of the units at one end of the project while tearing down and building the New Orleans-style homes on the other end, Enterprise would make it possible for former Lafitte tenants to return to New Orleans now. But everything is on hold; no one can get started until the Advancement Project's trial concludes. \n",
      " The problem is compounded by a July 1 deadline for developers to spend 10 percent of a project's total development cost using Gulf Opportunity Zone low-income tax credits or risk losing them. In that case, everyone loses. Considering that many of its objectives are being met, the Advancement Project should take yes for an answer and let demolition begin. The displaced people of New Orleans have waited long enough to go home. If they can go home to apartments better than the ones they fled, that should be applauded, not denounced in court.: [3251, 3194, 3112]\n",

      " The sudden, brutal death of Diana, princess of Wales, at the young age of 36, preempted and quickly engulfed all other news and all other subjects Saturday night. This was true not just in Britain and the rest of Western Europe and the United States, but all around the world. There was much more to this response, we think, which included a torrent of expressions of grief and offerings of flowers and other tokens of condolence, than the usual, age-old human fascination with horrible accidents and unexpected reversals of fortune, especially as they befall the powerful and exalted. And the predictable media extravagance and exploitation didn't explain it all either. \n",
      " The young woman who died in a Paris hospital at the end of the summer of 1997, had been, from the day almost two decades ago when she entered the public's consciousness as the wife-to-be of the heir to the British throne, the central figure in a gripping and continuously unfolding drama. It was part \"fairy tale\" and romance, as no one ever tired of saying, but in larger part we think, contemporary morality play, as well -- and nothing if not searingly up to date. Diana, as one commentator observed Saturday night, grew into an identifiable human being in the course of her miserable marriage and its aftermath, as distinct from the innocent, happy, almost fictional abstraction she had seemed to be at the beginning of the public's fascination with her. Behind all the luxury and glamour and high-style, she seemed to be dealing in the 1997 way with the familiar personal issues that so many others face. She was breathtakingly unconventional by traditional standards of propriety and role-modelship. At the same time she was deeply engaged in good works and proved it by taking real personal risks in the pursuit of her different causes. She was insistent that her children gain an unroyal appreciation of something approximating normal life. And she was famous for her ability to connect naturally and empathetically with others who lived far outside the beautiful-people universe she inhabited. It was her insistence on trying to add this dimension to her royal life -- and succeeding in doing so -- that distinguished her, we think, and won her a wide following. \n",
      " The conduct of the \"paparazzi\" was said to have been particularly reckless on Saturday night, and the alleged response of one, reported to have moved in at once for priceless photos of the kill, rather than trying to help, takes the breath away-although there are precedents for it in the mainstream press on dramatic occasions in the past. But the hounding, harassing role of these ruthless junkies, who supply the tabloids, the rest of the media and the public with the photos they --   we -- all simultaneously seem to crave and denounce -- is a separate question for another day.: [2635, 2627, 2604]\n",

      " School-sanctioned prayer, a cause supported by incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has been illegal in the United States since the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1962. But that hasn't kept school districts in Mississippi and other parts of the South from allowing it. \n",
      " In the past year both Mississippi and Alabama have passed laws requiring schools to allow prayer at student events, Georgia has adopted a law requiring a moment of silence, and the Virginia Legislature has directed state school officials to adopt guidelines for prayer in the schools. \n",
      " In the eyes of school-prayer supporters, acts like these place the South at the vanguard of a social movement to restore traditional values to American life. But to people like the Herdahls, the movement spells trouble. \n",
      " \"It's a constitutional issue,\" said Lisa Herdahl, who filed a lawsuit over the issue last month. \"I believe that by having prayer in school they are taking away my religious upbringing of my children.\" \n",

In areas such as this one, where there is little religious diversity or where no parent wants to make waves by challenging tradition, the practice may never become an issue. \n",

      " Elementary school students receive similar biblical instruction every four days, on a rotating basis with art, music and physical education. \n",
      " \"I went to a Southern Baptist private school for one year when I was in high school,\" said Lisa Herdahl, who grew up in San Diego. \"We had less religious training in the Southern Baptist school than we have here in public school.\" \n",
      " In her lawsuit, she alleges that religious teaching is also routinely inserted into the school's regular instruction. \n",
      " When she complained, she said school officials always turned the discussion around to her faith in God. \n",
      " \"They told me there's never been a problem because everybody down here believes in God and in prayer and in the Bible,\" said Herdahl. \"I said that's not the point, but they would always turn it around. \n",
      " \"This is not about whether I believe in God or not,\" she said. \"It's about separation of church and state.\" \n",
      " Horton defends the Bible classes, saying they examine the Bible \"from a historical, literary perspective.\" \n",
      " \"We believe the Judeo-Christian heritage is the foundation of much of what we have in Western civilization -- political, economic and literary -- and it's taught from that perspective.\" \n",
      " During Bible class, the Herdahl children in elementary school are allowed to take an extra period of music, art or physical education. \n",
      " But being pulled from class calls attention to them and makes them the target of derision from other students, Herdahl said. One teacher worsened matters, the lawsuit alleges, by saying in class that her son was leaving because he didn't believe in God. \n",
      " Another teacher put earphones on the head of one of her children to keep him from hearing the daily prayer, which also called attention to him and resulted in taunts from his classmates, she alleges. \n",
      " Once she made an issue of religious teaching, Herdahl contends, school officials began to ignore her complaints about other issues. An assistant principal at the North Pontotoc Attendance Center -- a combined elementary, middle and high school -- told her he didn't want her children at the school, she said. \n",
      " Horton denies this. \n",
      " He said the official explained to Herdahl that prayer and Bible classes were a longstanding tradition, that it was supported by the students and that it was constitutional. \"He never said he wished that she wasn't in the school district. What he said was that this is the way we operate and that if she was looking for something different, she wouldn't be able to find it here.\" \n",
      " While Horton denies that there has been any harassment, either from teachers or from students, he concedes that religion is an emotional issue in the community. \n",
      " \"She attacked a practice that has gone on in this county for a long, long time,\" he said. \"People in the county support it, and they don't want it to be stopped.\" \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " Tumult in Mississippi over the school prayer issue is not new. Shortly after Herdahl moved to Ecru in October 1993, a firestorm of controversy erupted in a different part of the state over the firing of a school principal for allowing students to read prayers over the school intercom. \n",
      " His dismissal was later downgraded to a suspension, but not before thousands of protesters -- including Gov. Kirk Fordice -- rallied at the state Capitol and more than 1,000 students across the state staged school walkouts to protest the punishment. \n",
      " The law authorizing student-led prayer in the schools passed the Legislature on the heels of the controversy. After the constitutionality of the law was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and People for the American Way, a federal judge struck down most of its provisions in September. \n",
      " The state is appealing the ruling. \n",
      " In Pontotoc County, school officials watched the controversy unfold with interest but without alarm. They are confidant, Horton said, that local practices are constitutional. \n"

      " In the coming days, the Senate will be tasked with salvaging a badly discredited agency: the Consumer Product Safety Commission. After last year's repeated recalls of unsafe toys and consumer panic over just about everything coming out of China (which covers a lot), the House in December unanimously passed a bill to modernize the agency and increase its funding. The Senate's most recent companion bill, which will probably be voted on next week, in several ways would even better equip the CPSC to deal with the new demands of the global marketplace and rightly restore consumers' faith in the things they buy. \n",
      " The bill would do several very good things: It would authorize a gradual increase in the agency's funding -- stripped down over the past decade -- to $155.9 million in fiscal 2015 from $63 million in fiscal 2007. It would introduce new safeguards, including tighter limits on lead in toys and other products, and mandatory independent testing of goods before they go to market. \n",
      " The bill also would allow the commission to more quickly disclose verified product safety risks to consumers and require it to disclose all consumer safety complaints in a public database. Both the commission and industry have grumbled about the latter disclosure requirement, but if properly labeled with the disclaimer that complaints have not yet been investigated by the agency, the database would help disseminate potential safety concerns more quickly and without confusion. A similar database, run by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, already exists for vehicle safety complaints. \n",
      " The commission and manufacturers have also complained about new authority the legislation would give to state attorneys general to monitor and address safety hazards, as well as new protections that would be afforded whistleblowers in manufacturing. Like the consumer complaints database, however, these changes would promote transparency, oversight and general good behavior. By passing this bill, the Senate would re-empower an agency that has struggled to confront the growing global marketplace's unknown consumer product risks.: [3359, 3319, 3259]\n",

      " Strong ethics rules are worthwhile only if coupled with strong ethics enforcement. That is something that has been lacking in the congressional ethics process, whose cozy structure too often combines a glacial pace with a see-no-evil mentality. The setup of lawmakers as ethical arbiters of their colleagues isn't foxes guarding the henhouse -- it's foxes guarding the foxes. So it was an achievement -- albeit slow in coming, difficult to achieve and decidedly imperfect -- when a House task force, appointed at the start of the Congress by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., announced its long-awaited proposal to create an independent office to review ethics complaints. \n",
      " The proposed Office of Congressional Ethics would be headed by six board members appointed jointly by the speaker and minority leader; the idea is to name respected figures such as former judges or lawmakers who would be assisted by a professional staff. The office, which could act at the prompting of two board members, would conduct preliminary reviews of ethics matters, drop those that appear meritless and pursue those deemed significant, for a maximum of 75 days. At the end of that second review, the office would forward its findings to the official ethics committee, composed of lawmakers. They would have 45 days to consider the findings. In most cases, the office's report to the ethics committee would eventually be made public. \n",
      " This would be a significant improvement over the current process, which too often seems to be a black box in which legitimate complaints of questionable behavior disappear, never to be heard of again. It is unfortunate that the Republican members of the special task force on ethics enforcement did not see fit to join the Democrats in endorsing the proposal. \n",
      " The biggest question is whether the new office would have adequate power to obtain needed testimony and documents. The task force rejected proposals to give the office subpoena power, concluding that subpoenas would cause too much delay. Subpoena power isn't necessary, the task force decided, because those being investigated will feel pressure to cooperate anyway, since referrals to the ethics panel could note a lack of cooperation and recommend requests for specific subpoenas. \"The threat of a subpoena is likely to compel a witness to cooperate almost as much as the subpoena itself,\" the report said. \n",
      " That seems overly optimistic. A better approach would be to empower the office to ask the ethics committee to issue subpoenas on its behalf. If the proposal is adopted in its current form, Pelosi should commit to revisiting the subpoena issue after the first year of operation to see if the office needs more authority.: [3413, 3362, 3315]\n",

      " Garang was returning from Uganda on Saturday after meeting with the president there when his aircraft went down in bad weather in rugged terrain in southern Sudan. The United Nations official, speaking on condition of anonymity from Kenya, said that rescue workers had identified the crash site and that Garang was believed to have died along with a bodyguard and the helicopter pilot. \n",
      " The death of the 60-year-old Sudan People's Liberation Movement leader is expected to deal a serious blow to Sudan's peace process. Garang was the driving force in a peace agreement signed this year between the largely Christian and animist south and Muslim Arab leaders in the north. As part of that deal, Garang was appointed July 9 as first vice president of Sudan and president of a semi-autonomous region in the south. \n",
      " \"This is going to throw the peace process into utter chaos,\" said Robert Collins, a former University of California, Santa Barbara professor and a Sudan scholar. \"Garang's presence as the link to the north was absolutely essential.\" \n",
      " Collins noted that Garang was a firm believer in keeping Sudan united, whereas many other rebel leaders and southerners would prefer to form a separate country. \n",
      " \"This will give enormous motivation to the separatists in the south,\" Collins said. \n",
      " After decades of oppression by Arabs in the north, southern Sudanese remain deeply distrustful of their countrymen in the capital, Khartoum, and many are likely to suspect foul play in the incident. \n",
      " In addition to his role in brokering peace for the south, Garang's ascension in Khartoum raised hopes in the United States that the former Marxist who more recently forged ties with the Christian right in America could help resolve the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. An estimated 180,000 people have been killed in that western area by government-backed militias. \n",

      "John Kenneth Galbraith, an economist, author, professor, presidential counselor and U.S. ambassador to India, who used caustic wit and an iconoclastic temperament to help set the foundation of modern economic thinking, died April 29 at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. The exact cause of death was not reported for Galbraith, who was 97. \n",
      " Galbraith spent more than 25 years on the Harvard University faculty and also advised Democratic presidents and candidates from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton. Socially, he may have been without peer in his field; he was said to have been one of the few, if not the only, economists invited to Truman Capote's 1966 Black and White Ball in New York. \n",
      " He was unabashedly a popularizer of economics -- he was credited with coining \"countervailing power\" and \"conventional wisdom,\" among other phrases -- and many of his more than 40 books were international best-sellers. \n",
      " One of the most influential was \"The Affluent Society\" (1958), which argued that overproduction of consumer goods was harming the public sector and depriving Americans of such benefits as clean air, clean streets, good schools and support for the arts. \n",
      " In the book, he painted a picture of epic opulence: \"The family which takes its mauve and cerise, air-conditioned, power-steered, and power-braked automobile out for a tour passes through cities that are badly paved, made hideous by litter, blighted buildings, billboards, and posts for wires that should long since have been put underground.\" \n",
      " \"They picnic,\" he added, \"on exquisitely packaged food from a portable icebox by a polluted stream and go on to spend the night in a park which is a menace to public health and morals. Just before dozing off on an air mattress, beneath a nylon tent, amid the stench of decaying refuse, they may reflect vaguely on the curious unevenness of their blessings.\" \n",
      " Galbraith was generally considered to have been an apostle of the theories advanced by British economist John Maynard Keynes: that government could promote full employment and a stable economy by stimulating spending and investment with adjustments in interest and tax rates, and deficit financing. \n",
      " Galbraith lamented what he believed to have been an excess accumulation of private wealth at the expense of public needs, and he warned that an unfettered free market system and capitalism without regulation would fail to meet basic social demands. This was echoed in \"The Affluent Society.\" \n",
      " His observations on a variety of economic and political matters were circulated at the highest levels, though they were sometimes ignored. \n",
      " In the early 1960s, while serving as John F. Kennedy's ambassador to India, Dr. Galbraith expressed grave doubts about increasing American involvement in the cankerous conflict brewing in Southeast Asia that would erupt into the Vietnam War. Later that decade, he was chairman of the left-leaning Americans for Democratic Action, and he backed the unsuccessful antiwar presidential candidacy of Sen. Eugene McCarthy, D-Minn., in 1968. \n",
      " Regarded by admirers such as Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., as a \"true Renaissance man,\" Galbraith also wrote about the art of India and several novels. One work of fiction, \"The Triumph\" (1968), was about the final days of a Central American dictatorship and its relationship to what the author called \"an uncontrollably funny institution\" -- the U.S. State Department. \n",
      " On national political commentary and journalistic punditry, Galbraith observed: \"Nearly all of our political comment originates in Washington. Washington politicians, after talking things over with each other, relay misinformation to Washington journalists who, after further intramural discussion, print it where it is thoughtfully read by the same politicians. It is the only completely closed system for the recycling of garbage that has yet been devised.\" \n",
      " He was no less caustic about his own profession. \n",
      " \"Economists,\" he once said, \"are most economical about ideas. They make the ones they learned in graduate school last a lifetime.\" An agricultural economist early in his career, he would describe himself as \"without rival as the nation's first expert on the price of hogs.\" And although he rated himself as \"barely average\" as a professor, his Harvard lectures routinely drew standing-room-only audiences. \n",
      " Despite periodic self-deprecation, Galbraith was widely said to have been arrogant and was described as such in a 1961 profile in the New York Times. When he complained to President Kennedy, \"I didn't see why they had to call me arrogant,\" the president answered, \"I don't see why not. Everybody else does.\" \n",
      " He was six feet eight inches tall and it was often said of him, as it was of French leader Charles de Gaulle, that it was difficult for a tall man to avoid looking down on others. A framed needlepoint in his Cambridge home near Harvard Yard proclaimed \"Galbraith's First Law: Modesty is a Vastly Overrated Virtue.\" \n",
      " Long overlooked for a Nobel Prize, he received from Clinton in 2000 the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the U.S. government's highest civilian honor. \n",
      " \"With clarity, wit and a keen social conscience, he has made complex economic theories and processes comprehensible to a wide audience and highlighted the social and ethical impacts of economic policies,\" the citation said. \"A tireless reformer of the free enterprise system, he has resolutely promoted social justice and challenged conventional assumptions in his Harvard classroom and in the public arena.\" \n",
      " John Kenneth Galbraith was born Oct. 15, 1908, on a small farm near Iona Station in the Canadian province of Ontario. Farm life, he later wrote, helped him appreciate the nature of manual labor. \n",
      " \"A long day following a plodding, increasingly reluctant team behind a harrow endlessly back and forth over the uninspiring Ontario terrain persuaded one that all other work was easy,\" he wrote. \"This early life could hardly have been in greater contrast with life at Harvard, where more than six hours of teaching a week is often considered a grave impairment of academic freedom.\" \n",
      " From his father, a leading figure in the local branch of the Canadian Liberal Party, he inherited his politics, his wit and his height. As a child he accompanied his father to political rallies. At one such gathering, the elder Galbraith climbed atop a pile of manure to address the crowd. \"He apologized with ill-concealed sincerity for speaking from the Tory platform,\" Dr. Galbraith later remembered. \n",
      " \"I congratulated him on the brilliance of the sally. He said, `It was good, but it didn't change any votes.' \" \n",
      " He studied animal husbandry at Ontario Agricultural College at Guelph, then took a doctorate in agricultural economics at the University of California at Berkeley. His first teaching appointment was at the university's Davis campus, which at the time was considered an academic backwater. \n",
      " A year later, he received a telegram offering him a position on the faculty at Harvard at $2,600 a year -- $800 more than he was making at Davis. Figuring he could use the Harvard offer as leverage for a raise at Davis, Galbraith showed the telegram to his dean. \"You're not worth that much to us,\" the dean told him, advising to accept the Harvard offer, which he did. \n",
      " In 1934, Galbraith joined the Harvard faculty, where he would serve with several interruptions until he retired in 1975. He became a U.S. citizen in 1937, then left the country on a year's sabbatical as a research fellow at Cambridge University in England, where he became a disciple of Keynesian economics. \n",
      " He served a year on the economics faculty at Princeton in 1939, then came to Washington to work with the National Defense Advisory Committee, established to prepare the U.S. economy for war. \n",
      " His mentor in the federal bureaucracy was Leon Henderson, a leading New Dealer. Henderson placed Galbraith in charge of the price division of the Office of Price Administration, which was arguably the most powerful civilian post in the management of the wartime economy. \n",
      " After two years, Galbraith and his staff had placed virtually all goods and services in the country under his control. But he had \"reached the point that all price fixers reach -- my enemies outnumbered my friends.\" \n",
      " In the midterm elections of 1942, the Democrats lost seats in Congress and business interests were demanding a clipping of Galbraith's economic wings. \n",
      " Starting in 1943, he spent five years writing and editing at Fortune magazine and took leaves of absence for special assignments. \n",
      " After Germany surrendered in 1945, he went to Europe to direct the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. He concluded from interviews with top Nazi leaders who had been taken into custody that extensive bombing by the U.S. and its Allies had done little or nothing to shorten the war. Of much greater import, he found, was the fact that \"in reality, German war management was for a long time half hearted and incompetent.\" He would find a similar lack of strategic effectiveness in the bombing of Japan. \n",
      " After rejoining the Harvard faculty in 1949 as professor of economics, he wrote the books that brought him renown as an economic thinker. Besides \"The Affluent Society,\" there was \"American Capitalism\" (1952), \"The New Industrial State\" (1967) and \"Economics and the Public Purpose\" (1973). \n",
      " In \"American Capitalism,\" he articulated his conception of \"countervailing power,\" and new patterns of competition among big labor, big business and big government. The thrust of this theory was that the power of big producers was balanced against the strength of big unions and big purchasers, such as chain stores. \n",
      " \"The New Industrial State\" theorized that the rise of giant multi-national corporations had also created a bureaucratic \"technostructure\" that exercised a powerful influence over the economy. In \"Economics and the Public Purpose,\" he discussed a bureaucratic reciprocity between big government and big business that he said often worked against the public interest. \n",
      " On the political front, Galbraith campaigned for John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. In 1961 he took a two-year leave from Harvard to be Kennedy's ambassador to India. Aside from the India-China border war of 1962, there was rarely a full day's work to be done, so the ambassador used the extra time to write more books. \n",
      " Among them were \"Indian Painting\" (1968), an art book he wrote with Mohinder Singh Randhawa; and his first novel, \"The McLandress Dimension\" (1963), a satire which he wrote under the pseudonym of Mark Epernay. \n",
      " After leaving New Delhi, Galbraith wrote \"Ambassador's Journal\" (1969), a day-to-day account of his service in India for which he received a guaranteed fee of $250,000 from Houghton Mifflin. \"On this the federal taxes were sufficient to cover my ambassadorial salary of $27,500 annually with around a hundred percent additional return,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \n",
      " He had already established a practice of turning over to the Harvard economics department a share of the royalties he received for other books he had written. \n",
      " As a longtime friend of Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson, Dr. Galbraith was said to have been under consideration for ambassador to the United Nations when Johnson became president. This never materialized, but Galbraith was among the president's advisers early in the Johnson Administration. \n",
      " As the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam escalated, the relationship between Dr. Galbraith and Johnson deteriorated and eventually dissolved. By 1967, Dr. Galbraith had become chairman of Americans for Democratic Action, a leading anti-war group. In 1968, he was a key figure in the presidential campaign of Sen. Eugene McCarthy (D-Minn.), whose candidacy helped drive Johnson from office. \n",
      " In retirement from Harvard, albraith continued to write, travel and speak to packed auditoriums. He wrote an autobiography, \"A Life in Our Times\" (1981). He was host of the British-made television series, \"The Age of Uncertainty,\" and author of a best selling book by the same name. With Soviet economist Stanislav Menshikov, he wrote \"Capitalism, Communism and Coexistence: From a Bitter Past to a Better Prospect.\" Published in 1988, the book was a compilation of informal discussions between the two men. \n",
      " In 1999 Galbraith wrote \"Name Dropping,\" a collection of remembrances of famous figures he'd encountered, ranging from Harry Truman to Jawaharlal Nehru. He divided his time between his home in Cambridge, summers at his \"unfarmed farm\" in Newfane, Vt., and a chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, where he spent winters skiing. \n",
      " Galbraith was often in transit at airports all over the world, waiting for connecting flights. Like F. Scott Fitzgerald, he liked to browse in bookshops looking for examples of his own work. Once at LaGuardia Airport in New York, he asked a clerk if she had a copy of \"The Great Crash,\" his 1955 analysis of the 1929 stock market collapse. \"Not an easy book to sell at an airport,\" said the clerk, looking extremely sympathetic. \n"

      " A crowd gathered Saturday for the liquidation of the Atlanta Museum, an obscure, sentimental collection that for years was housed in a Victorian mansion on Atlanta's Peachtree Street. \n",
      " On the block were such curiosities as a chunk of the tree under which Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered, a fragment of rope allegedly used to hang the Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo, and a glass jar President Franklin D. Roosevelt used to relieve himself in during the night. \n",
      " The collection was amassed by James Elliott, Sr., an Atlanta antique dealer who so prized his antiquities that every time he made a sale, he would \"have to go to bed for a day or two,\" said his daughter-in-law, Mary Gene Elliott. For decades, Elliott charged $2 for a visit to the house, where signs urged guests to \"Observe Closely Objects of Historical Rarity.\" \n",
      " Locals remember Elliott's museum as a mysterious, musty, exciting place where they were as likely to run into a fun-house mirror as a historically significant napkin ring. The stories behind the curious exhibits, written in Elliott's spidery handwriting, sometimes stretched credulity, said John Sexton, a local appraiser. \n",
      " \"Nothing in here is fake per se,\" said Sexton. \"It's just the provenance is questionable.\" \n",
      " That didn't keep Sexton from bidding $3,000 on a locket said to contain a swatch of Napoleon Bonaparte's hair. Of course, he reasoned, there's always a chance it's real. \n",
      " Elliott's collection was part of a tradition of private Southern museums, where families would preserve twigs from Civil War battlefields or the sweat-stained uniforms of long-dead soldiers. When Elliott died, in 1975, Atlanta had turned away from Old South nostalgia in favor of progressive boosterism. In the final years the museum was open, \"no one paid it any attention. No one visited,\" said Steve Slotin, whose auction house arranged Saturday's sale. The museum closed its doors in 1996 and is now in the process of being sold. \n",
      " \"Atlanta has just moved on,\" Slotin said, \"even though the rest of the Southeast has not.\" \n",
      " But at the sale on Saturday, buyers from all over the country leapt at Elliott's treasures. John Lamb, a Texas businessman who was born in Georgia, paid $76,000 for a cotton gin believed to be Eli Whitney's prototype. Lamb had flown in Friday night after reading about the auction in the Wall Street Journal. \n",
      " After he made the purchase, people applauded. A waitress poured him a large plastic cup of Jim Beam. \n",
      " \"It's not that I wanted it for myself,\" said Lamb, 52. \"I just didn't want someone in California to get it, you know?\" \n",
      " A dark-haired woman holding a phone, representing Ripley's Believe It or Not, bid $4,000 for a lock of Andrew Jackson's hair and $6,250 for the Napoleon locket. \n",
      " Ripley's placed winning bids on at least 10 items, including one of the most bizarre and bloody: A curtain tie from the room where Tojo, then the Japanese Prime Minister, tried to kill himself by shooting himself in the head. Tojo survived, but not for long; also included in the collection is a piece of rope that was eventually used to hang him. \n",
      " All day, as they waited for the auction to begin, people milled around with expressions of surprise and puzzlement. \n",
      " Durwood Pepper, 43, held up a jar containing a mummified piece of apple pie made by FDR's personal cook. It was curved and black, like the insole of a boot. \"Now, wouldn't that be nice to have at your house?\" he said brightly. \n",
      " A New York dealer, who had driven much of the previous day to reach the auction, grumbled about authenticity after examining several pieces of silver. He would drive back empty-handed. \n",
      " \"If that's Paul Revere, I'm Barry Bonds,\" he said. \n",
      " Elliott received many of his exhibits from the members of other Georgia families passing on treasures from their attics, and often relied on their accounts to establish provenance. That may have been an error, said one local collector, who refused to give his name out of fear of offending. \n",
      " \"In the South, when people are talking about the Civil War, there are an awful lot of colonels and generals that find their way into their families,\" he said. \n",
      " Elliott also benefited from the turn-of-the-century habit of saving bricks or handkerchiefs or other mementoes from the site of a historic event. After Lee surrendered under a tree at Appomattox, curiosity-seekers \"literally took that tree apart,\" John Elliott said, cutting pieces out of it for souvenirs until they cut all the way down to its roots. \n",
      " James Elliott's chunk, along with two sketches of Lee, Lee's mother's sewing kit and a drinking glass Lee used, sold for $1,600 on Saturday. Sexton, the appraiser, said it's a fair price as long as the collector believes the story behind it. \n",
      " \"What's a chunk of wood worth?\" he said. \"It doesn't matter!\": [3386, 3355, 3273]\n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: \n",
      " Close your eyes and listen to the Democratic presidential candidates, and you might think it's the 2000 campaign all over again. \"They're for the powerful and we're for the people,\" Vice President Al Gore said in his convention speech, pointing to \"big tobacco, big oil, the big polluters, the pharmaceutical companies, the HMOs.\" Flash forward to John Kerry's New Hampshire victory speech: \"I have a message for the influence peddlers, for the polluters, the HMOs, the big drug companies that get in the way, the big oil and the special interests who now call the White House their home. We're coming, you're going, and don't let the door hit you on the way out.\" \n",
      " Mr. Gore told voters four years ago that the election was about \"whether forces standing in your way will keep you from living a better life.\" Mr. Kerry promises to \"take on the powerful special interests that stand in your way.\" Mr. Kerry told Roger Simon of U.S. News & World Report recently that he found Mr. Gore's brand of populism \"too divisive and a little bit shrill,\" but it's not clear where their two messages diverge. \n",
      " The mantle of populist outsider rests as uneasily on Mr. Kerry as it did on Mr. Gore: Both are sons of privilege who spent their careers in the corridors of power. On the campaign trail, Mr. Kerry says he wants to \"free our government from the dominance of the lobbyists,\" yet his campaign war chest is filled with more lobbyist cash than the treasuries of his rivals. But the real issue has to do with substance, not biography. A campaign that descends to primitive business-bashing does not reflect well on any candidate. \n",
      " Mr. Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, has argued that the campaign's \"people against the powerful\" message was a tactical as well as substantive mistake, turning off independent voters \"who don't see America as us versus them.\" Others disagree, pointing out that Mr. Gore did win the popular vote and that the argument may resonate more in 2004 than it did four years ago: Attacking the special interests in charge works better when your party is out of power in the executive branch and both houses of Congress. And the Bush White House offers a legitimate target for criticism on everything from the vice president's industry-dominated energy task force to a Medicare bill tilted toward HMOs and drug companies to a tax cut whose benefits went primarily to the wealthy. \n",
      " But as Mr. Kerry and his rivals inveigh against corporate special interests, what they leave out is significant too. The Democratic Party too often is captive to its own special interests, and in the past Mr. Kerry recognized this. He has taken on teachers unions with proposals to end tenure for public school teachers. Citing a \"generational responsibility\" to fix Social Security, he said in 1996 that Congress should consider means-testing benefits. But that Kerry is nowhere to be found on the campaign trail. \n"

      " It may be asking an awful lot of candidates to adopt such stances during the primary season. After all, Bill Clinton's Sister Souljah moment -- he used a speech before Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition to criticize the rap singer's racially divisive comments and thereby illustrate his willingness to say unpopular things before traditionally Democratic audiences -- didn't come until he had the nomination sewn up. But Mr. Clinton's success was based on his ability to merge the populist themes captured in the title of his campaign manifesto, \"Putting People First,\" with a centrist New Democrat agenda of personal responsibility and fiscal discipline. And like Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry and Howard Dean know better -- they know that business is not the source of all evil and that solutions to the nation's troubles are a lot more complex than booting fat cats out the Oval Office door.: [3488, 3478, 3399]\n",

      "The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility has opened an investigation of alleged misconduct by about two dozen current and former government lawyers involved in the 1983 prosecution of former CIA officer Edwin P. Wilson. \n",
      " A federal judge in Houston this week overturned Wilson's conviction for illegally selling explosives to Libya in the years after he left the agency, writing that the government \"knowingly used false evidence\" in Wilson's trial and his appeal. Justice Department and CIA lawyers concealed the fact that Wilson did work for the agency after he left its official employ, said U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes. \n",
      " \"The government could have produced records supporting Wilson's claim that the CIA knew -- even authorized -- the shipment of explosives to Libya,\" Hughes wrote in an opinion that lambasted Reagan-era CIA and Justice Department officials. \n",
      " Whenever a court makes a finding of misconduct by federal prosecutors, the professional responsibility office is required to open an investigation. The U.S. attorneys' manual states that in such an event, \"OPR shall conduct an expedited inquiry without awaiting further judicial or appellate proceedings.\" \n",
      " Justice Department officials said that if the OPR found misconduct, it could recommend disciplinary action against current employees and suggest that state bar associations levy sanctions. It also could refer suspected crimes for prosecution. \n",
      " Department officials said they could not comment on the OPR investigation other than to confirm that it has begun. A spokesman for the CIA said the agency \"will certainly cooperate with their review of the matter.\" \n",
      " CIA officials reiterated this week that the agency was not involved in and did not authorize Wilson's decision to sell explosives to Libya. Wilson remains in prison on two other convictions, including conspiring to have prosecutors and witnesses against him killed. \n",
      " Hughes cited the government's decision to use at trial an affidavit from the CIA's executive director, Charles Briggs, showing that Wilson did not work for the agency \"directly\" or \"indirectly\" after leaving his job in 1971. Hughes found that the CIA had more than 80 contacts with Wilson in ensuing years and used him to gain intelligence about Libya, Iran, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The affidavit, Hughes wrote, was \"nothing but a lie.\" \n",
      " \"In the course of American justice,\" he continued, \"one would have to work hard to conceive of a more fundamentally unfair process with a consequentially unreliable result than the fabrication of false data by the government, under oath by a government official, presented knowingly by the prosecutor in the courtroom with the express approval of his superiors in Washington.\" \n",
      " Former CIA general counsel Stanley Sporkin, now retired from the federal bench, unsuccessfully argued at the time against including some of the language in the Briggs memo because he was not convinced the agency could be sure about Wilson's indirect contacts with the CIA. But he said fRIday that Justice Department and CIA officials did not knowingly submit false evidence. \n",
      " \"It's ridiculous. It could not have happened. Look at the people who were involved -- myself, top officials of the Justice Department, the CIA. They are honorable people,\" Sporkin said. \n",
      " Those officials did not believe they were submitting false information to the court, he said, and only learned later of Wilson's extensive post-employment contacts with the CIA.: [3431, 3421, 3323]\n",

      "See Abortion, Page COLUMN ONEA Late Decision, a Lasting AnguishA Kansas doctor is under investigation for performing abortions others won't. His clients say outsiders can't grasp their pain or gratitude.By Stephanie Simon \n",
      " Times Staff Writer \n",
      " WICHITA, Kan. -- The moment is burned forever in her mind: The small exam room, her husband's ashen face, her sobs as the doctor guided a needle into her womb to kill her son. \n",
      " It's been 41/2 years, and still Marie Becker can feel Daniel kicking inside her, kicking and kicking as she choked back hysteria -- kicking until the drug stopped his heart and she felt only stillness. \n",
      " She prayed Daniel would forgive her. \n",
      " She prayed for forgiveness from God as well. Becker had been taught that abortion was a sin; she wanted so to believe it might also be a blessing. In her seventh month of pregnancy she had learned Daniel had a fatal genetic disorder and his life would be brief and brutal. She wanted to spare him that. \n",
      " \"For the love of God, the last thing I wanted to do was to murder my own child,\" she said recently. \"This was something we did out of love and respect for him.\" \n",
      " Becker, who asked to be identified by her middle and maiden names, tells Daniel's story to other pregnant women who find out when they are many months along that their babies are terminally ill or severely disabled. Through an online support group, she listens as they work through their options; if they choose abortion, she tells them what to expect. \n",
      " These days she also prays for one of the few doctors in the nation who will take them as patients: Dr. George R. Tiller, who performed her abortion. Specializing in late second- and third-trimester abortions, his clinic here draws women from across the country and around the world. \n",
      " Tiller's clinic aborted 295 viable fetuses last year and 318 the year before; his website says that he has performed more late-term abortions than anyone else practicing in the Western Hemisphere. \n",
      " But the clinic is now under criminal investigation for some of those procedures. \n",
      " Like most states, Kansas does not permit abortions of viable fetuses unless carrying the pregnancy to term would substantially and irreversibly damage the mother's health. Kansas Atty. Gen. Phill Kline is investigating whether Tiller's patients were truly in that much danger. Tiller's lawyers respond that he has \"always consistently, carefully and appropriately followed the law in all respects.\" \n",
      " Kline, who opposes all abortions, maintains that the mental health concerns some women cite as their main reason for terminating -- including depression or anxiety about raising a disabled child -- do not justify late-term abortions under Kansas law. He has demanded access to the medical records of dozens of patients. The clinic has appealed to the state Supreme Court; a decision is expected within weeks. \n",
      " Tiller's patients await the ruling with mounting anger. They say no outsider could ever understand the complex tangle of emotions that brought them to Women's Health Care Services -- the psychological and physical strains that made continuing their pregnancies unbearable. \n",
      " \"I don't know what I would have done had [Dr. Tiller] not been available to me,\" said Katie Plazio, a financial analyst from New Jersey. \"That's selfish, I know. I feel selfish. But doesn't everyone want the best for themselves and their family?\" \n",
      " Like Becker and most women who spoke for this story, Plazio asked to use her middle and maiden names to protect her privacy. Many of Tiller's patients have not told their co-workers, friends or even close relatives that they had terminated pregnancies. Their abortions were verified by a review of clinic records they supplied. \n",
      " For Plazio, the heartache began with the unexpected. After a decade of infertility, she was stunned to feel a kick to her ribs as she sat through a meeting in February 2001. She had been dieting for weeks, running five miles a day -- and wondering why she still couldn't squeeze into her pants. She was six months pregnant. \n",
      " Overjoyed, Plazio and her husband scheduled an amniocentesis. The preliminary results were clean; bursting with excitement, Plazio, then 43, bought a baby blanket dotted with pale blue bunnies. Ten days later, her doctor called with devastating news: More complete genetic tests had determined that their son had Down syndrome. \n",
      " Plazio had studied special education in college; working with adults with Down syndrome, she had seen their lives as lonely, frustrating, full of hurt. She was not sure she could find joy in raising her son to such a future. She didn't think she could cope with what she anticipated would be a lifetime of sadness and struggle. \n",
      " Giving her son up for adoption seemed even worse -- to wake each morning not knowing where he was, imagining him scared and alone. \"I could not live with that fear all my life,\" Plazio said. \n",
      " \"I don't want anyone to think that I did this all for Matthew,\" she said. \"I was not just sparing him problems. I was sparing my daughter, my husband, me and all those who depend on me I knew the limits of my family and my marriage. Maybe there are families who can handle it all. Maybe they are better people. But I knew I could not do it.\" \n",
      " In March 2001, a week into her third trimester, she and her husband flew to Tiller's clinic. They took the bunny blanket and a teddy bear with a big red heart on its chest -- a gift to the baby from their daughter, then 11. \n",
      " Since her abortion, Plazio has suffered such severe panic attacks that she can't drive even as far as the high school to watch her daughter cheerlead. She has gained 60 pounds as she battles depression. The abortion she sought to preserve her mental health has left her deeply shaken; doctors say she suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome. \n",
      " Her mental health, she is convinced, would be even worse had she tried to raise a profoundly disabled son -- or had she given him up for adoption. \n",
      " The abortion \"released my poor sick baby back to the angels,\" she said. \"The only thing I wish I had done differently was realize I was pregnant months earlier.\" \n",
      " Third-trimester terminations like Plazio's are unusual. \n",
      " About 95% of U.S. abortions are performed within the first 15 weeks of pregnancy, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit center for reproductive rights and health research. \n",
      " About 20,000 women a year seek abortions after the 21st week, which marks roughly the midway point in a pregnancy. Perhaps 1,000 terminate after 24 weeks, when the fetus is generally considered viable. The practice, though rare, makes many Americans uneasy. While 60% say abortion should be legal in the first trimester of pregnancy, 12% say it should be legal in the third trimester, according to a Harris poll conducted in February. \n",
      " Three clinics in the nation perform abortions in the third trimester. One is in Los Angeles, one in Boulder, Colo. The best-known -- recommended by many genetic counselors -- is Tiller's bunker-like clinic on a freeway frontage road in Wichita, next to a car dealership. Outside, protesters have erected dozens of white crosses; they maintain a prayer vigil by the gate and try to pull women aside for counseling -- especially on Tuesday mornings, when Tiller sees patients seeking late-term abortions. \n",
      " The women who push past the protesters Tuesdays include young victims of rape or incest who did not realize they were pregnant until just weeks from their due dates. Most are married women with much-wanted pregnancies who got a late diagnosis of fetal anomaly: a malformed heart, a missing brain, an open spinal column, an extra chromosome. \n",
      " Some of the deformities are lethal. Others are not. A few fall in a gray area: The physical problems may be repaired through surgery, but the operations are risky and grueling. \n",
      " One patient who had an abortion at 25 weeks in November said she could not bear to imagine surgeons cutting open her daughter's tiny chest to rebuild her heart. The thought of her Emma spending months of her childhood in the hospital overwhelmed the woman, a 30-year-old technology educator from Virginia who asked to be identified by her middle name, Paige. \n",
      " \"Part of me just wanted to let her die,\" Paige said. \"Is that horrible?\" \n",
      " Marie Becker had the same impulse -- and the same question -- about her son. \n",
      " At a four-month ultrasound, the doctor noticed that Daniel's limbs seemed short. She told Becker not to worry, but suggested another ultrasound in a few weeks. At that appointment, Daniel again measured short. Becker was told to come back in another month. \n",
      " Becker, an accounting clerk, and her husband, a teacher, tried not to dwell on their fears for their first child. They delighted in the ultrasound pictures: Blurry black-and-white images of an arm, a leg, a face. In one, Daniel appeared to be waving; the technician typed a caption: \"Hi, mom!\" \n",
      " Becker was 27 weeks pregnant when she went in for her next appointment. By then, it was clear that something was wrong. \n",
      " A few days later, her doctor confirmed that Daniel had a rare and lethal skeletal disease. His organs were growing normally, but his bones were not; his tiny rib cage was slowly crushing his expanding heart and lungs. \"His prognosis was death,\" Becker said. \"Not at 8 years old. Not at 10 years old. Within a few months at most.\" \n",
      " In her Florida home, with her husband at her side, Becker wept and prayed for days. Conflicting emotions overwhelmed her. She was scared to carry Daniel to term -- scared of how she would react to his deformities. She was afraid to abort, sure she would burn in hell. Her son disgusted her; she wanted him out of her body. She loved him. She wanted to protect him. \n",
      " Becker, who was then 30, blamed herself for making Daniel sick: Hadn't she taken migraine pills before she knew she was pregnant? Hadn't she sipped a few glasses of wine? Was it that ride at SeaWorld, the one that whirled her around? Had that caused his genes to mutate? \n",
      " \"I was so afraid,\" she said. \"It was bad enough that I had inflicted this on him. I didn't want him to suffer any more.\" \n",
      " The week before Christmas, at the start of her third trimester, Becker and her husband flew to Kansas. \n",
      " Every detail of the trip remains vivid. She remembers staring, transfixed, at the freshly cleaned carpet in the Wichita airport. She remembers driving to the hotel through ice and snow -- and turning away from a billboard plastered with gruesome photos of aborted fetuses. On the morning of the appointment, she threw up in the hotel shower, then insisted she needed time to style her hair; her looks seemed the one thing she could control, and she took long minutes applying her lipstick. \n",
      " When she and her husband turned into the clinic parking lot, a handful of elderly protesters swarmed them, yelling, \"Don't go in!\" and \"You don't have to do this!\" \n",
      " The activists were peaceful that day, but there had been scattered violence: The clinic was bombed in 1986 and blockaded for six weeks in the summer of 1991. In 1993, an antiabortion activist shot Tiller through both arms. He now works in a bulletproof vest. \n",
      " Armed guards pat down patients and walk them through a metal detector at the clinic door. After paying for their abortions -- which can cost more than $5,000, depending on the stage of pregnancy -- patients wait in a room decorated floor to ceiling with framed letters from grateful women. \n",
      " \"We couldn't stop reading them,\" Becker said. \"When you see how many people wrote letters, when you see how much they love this man, it almost feels like you're being hugged.\" \n",
      " Becker still believes that abortion is wrong in most cases. Sitting in her Florida bungalow, her two young daughters playing beside her, she recalled a movie she once saw in Catholic school, of a baby being ripped limb from limb. The image haunts her. \n",
      " She finds it reprehensible that Tiller aborts healthy fetuses in the first and second trimester (and even, sometimes, in the third trimester when the mother is very young, or a victim of rape). But she cannot censure him too harshly. \n",
      " For children like Daniel, \"the man is a savior,\" she said. \"He's there for women who have nowhere else to go.\" \n",
      " With most advanced pregnancies, Tiller performs abortions by injecting the fetus with digoxin to stop its heart. He then gradually dilates the woman's cervix to induce labor. After two or three days of contractions, the women -- heavily dosed with pain medication -- deliver their babies intact. \n",
      " Some refuse to look. But many hug their dead children. \"It was very important to us to be able to hold her, to give her that kind of respect,\" said Paige, who aborted her daughter at the end of the second trimester. \"This was not just a fetus to me. She was my child.\" \n",
      " After Susan Crocker's second-trimester abortion in August, she and her fiance spent three hours cradling their daughter, Isabella, who had Down syndrome. They stroked her scrunched red face and kissed her rounded cheeks. They took pictures of her tiny, almost translucent hands, folded across a green-and-pink striped blanket. \n",
      " Crocker, a 34-year-old customer service manager, keeps Isabella's ashes in a marble urn decorated with dolphins; she kisses it before she goes to bed each night. Her sons follow her lead. On Halloween, they each gave a Tootsie Roll to Isabella. Jordan, 5, shares his toys with her, propping a little plastic skateboard against the urn. \n",
      " When a doctor once referred to Crocker as a mother of two, Jamie, the 9-year-old, interrupted indignantly: \"No, she has three kids.\" \n",
      " \"Her daughter's in her heart,\" said Jordan. \n",
      " Despite her family's support, Crocker, who lives in Texas, has struggled with doubt and depression. \"I did the unthinkable,\" she said. \"I ended my baby's life. Sometimes I think, oh God, what if I was wrong?\" \n",
      " Then she thinks about the room where Tiller stopped Isabella's heart. There was a poster on the ceiling of a leaping dolphin. Underneath, it said: \"Set them free.\" \n",
      " She believes Isabella is free. \n",
      " \"I ended her suffering,\" she said. \"I owe Dr. Tiller greatly. I can never, ever thank him enough.\" \n",
      " Crocker sometimes wishes she could talk to the protesters who shouted as she entered the clinic: \"Think about your baby!\" She would tell them she was thinking of Isabella then, and thinks of her still, every day, with love. She would ask them not to judge. \n"

      "The maxim is part of every management consultant's creed, as vital as brushing your teeth: Executive compensation should be tied to stock price, and the more shares management owns the better. \n",
      " Now a new study raises a distressing question: Could there be too much of this good thing? Will executives who own large chunks of their own company become too cautious and avoid lucrative deals for fear of cracking their nest egg? \n",
      " In a paper published in the April issue of the Academy of Management Journal, four researchers who studied 358 firms in 1986 and 514 firms in 1992 have reached that unsettling conclusion. \n",
      " If corporate insiders' total stake in their company remains below 7.5 percent, the study says, they will take the sort of risks that are in shareholders' long-term interest. But when their holdings rise above that level, they begin to lose heart, like a new Rolls-Royce owner afraid to take his or her expensive car onto the highway. \n",
      " \"The practice of increasing insider ownership may require modification,\" concluded the authors, Peter Wright of the University of Memphis, Stephen P. Ferris of the University of Missouri at Columbia, and Atulya Sarin and Vidya Awasthi of Santa Clara University. \n",
      " The authors cite previous research that indicates insiders with too much stock may also feel too entrenched to be removed and thus ignore shareholder wishes. \n",
      " Such studies provide new ammunition for increasingly popular assaults on executive-compensation plans. Some critics suggest that attaching pay so tightly to stock price has created boardroom monsters, eager to fire thousands of workers so Wall Street will laud them for reducing costs and raise the value of their stock holdings to the level of some Third World national treasuries. \n",
      " Management consultants who specialize in executive compensation say they are interested in reading the new study, but are skeptical of its conclusions. They acknowledge that rich and timid insiders can be a problem, but their own work so far shows no consistent relationship between heavy stock holdings and reluctance to take risks. \n",
      " \"It seems to make sense as a kind of classic economics theory,\" said Graef S. Crystal, a San Diego-based compensation expert. But he said he distrusts theories that present human beings as purely economic creatures, \"who will kill their mothers for a quarter and will respond to every incentive that you give them.\" \n",
      " Wright, a professor of management at Memphis, said his team decided to expand earlier research on insider motives and actions by organizing the broadest look ever at risk-taking and equity ownership. \n",
      " The researchers scored each company's willingness to take risk by examining financial analysts' predictions of its future earnings. \n",
      " If the predictions were very similar, the researchers assumed the company was taking few chances and gave them a low score. If the analysts disagreed widely over future earnings, the researchers concluded the company was introducing new products or marketing new territory where the outcome was difficult to predict. The company received a high risk-taking score. \n",
      " Risk-taking, at least to a point, benefits stockholders, Wright said, because it helps a company beat its competitors, bring in large returns and push its stock price up. Investors unwilling to accept the risk that comes with the possibility of healthy profits would not invest in stocks but would buy less-chancy investments, such as bonds, that offer lower returns. \n",
      " The researchers warned that \"although corporate risk-taking may ordinarily create value, this is not always true.\" It noted that RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. took great risks trying to develop a profitable smokeless cigarette, but so far has failed to do so. \n",
      " The researchers calculated the total percentage of company stock held by each firm's senior executives and board members. They also calculated the holdings of large private stockholders and institutional investors to see if they had an impact on corporate behavior. \n",
      " The study looked at risk-taking in 1986 and 1992, as well as two years after each initial survey to see if behavior had changed. It focused on companies whose industries showed potential for growth, on the assumption that risk-taking with no growth potential was usually pointless. \n",
      " The presence of large private stockholders appeared to have no impact on risk-taking, while institutional investors appeared to increase the willingness to take risks. \n",
      " Ira Kay, director of compensation consulting at the management consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide, said other research indicates a company manager's appetite for risk declines in some cases as his stake in the company increases. A study of the gold-mining industry, for instance, showed executives owning gold stock were more likely to buy risk-reducing hedges against their investment than executives who held stock options, which only offer the opportunity to buy shares. \n",
      " A wise compensation consultant, several experts said, will make certain a company does not force a manager to buy more stock than he or she can afford, thus reducing the chance of harmful caution in making decisions. \n",
      " \"Many of these programs fail to account for individual differences,\" said Arnold S. Ross, a partner with the consulting firm Hirschfeld, Stern, Moyer Ross Inc. Elizabeth A. Gall, New York regional director of Hay Management Consultants' executive compensation practice, said she had to tell one chief executive who was urging his managers to buy their company's shares that he was ignoring the college costs they faced. \n"

      " Critics allege that the rolls contained up to 2 million invalid names, and the redrawing of electoral boundaries is said to have been driven by the ruling party's electoral strategy. the European Union and Australia have declared Thursday's proceedings a sham. \n",

      " A prime goal of the ruling party is to draw a two-thirds majority of the vote, which would enable it to amend the constitution and appoint the 81-year-old Mugabe's successor without having to call an early election. \n",
      " Mugabe is empowered to appoint 30 members of parliament, making it difficult for the MDC to ever gain a majority. The opposition party won 57 seats in 2000 but lost six in byelections since then. \n",

      " Attorney General Janet Reno has rejected a third request that she seek an independent counsel to investigate possible violations of criminal law in connection with the fund-raising for President Clinton's re-election campaign. \n",
      " In each case, however, the Justice Department was careful to say that its announcement should not be read as an exoneration, and that it was not dropping the subject. \n",
      " Rather, each decision was couched in technical terms, having to do with the triggering mechanism in the independent-counsel statute (which some of those seeking appointment of an independent counsel have argued in the past was too easily tripped). \n",
      " The department said again Saturday that it has a task force of its own, made up of career prosecutors, that is continuing to investigate whether violations occurred. If the task force finds reason to believe they did occur, appropriate action will be taken, including possible appointment of an independent counsel, so the statement goes. \n",
      " That's OK for now; the department says watch us, and of course everyone will. The accusations that have been made thus far live at two levels. Common Cause and other petitioners have raised what might be called the generic issue. \n",
      " They say the entire financing of the presidential campaign, on both sides, was a violation of the campaign-finance law, its criminal and civil provisions alike. The president and Bob Dole accepted large amounts of public money in return for promises to abide by spending limits that they then disregarded. They raised and spent millions of extra dollars at one remove, through the Democratic and Republican national committees, most of it from sources and in amounts otherwise forbidden by law. \n",
      " Both parties thus flicked the law aside on the assumption that it never would be strictly enforced nor ever was meant to be, but in fact it should. That is the burden of these complaints. \n",
      " The second set goes more specifically to the extravagant fund-raising, particularly from sources with Asian connections, conducted by the Clinton campaign. Most of the questionable contributions that have become public thus far were raised by a former employee of a powerful Indonesian family who became a presidential appointee in the trade-policy part of the Commerce Department, and then a Democratic National Committee vice chairman for big bucks. \n",
      " More than $1 million of the money he raised has been returned on grounds that the gifts were illegal or inappropriate. No one knows if that's all, and above all no one knows what the donors were seeking and/or got for the money, some of which was in the six figures. \n",
      " The Justice Department claims to be capable of conducting this second inquiry fully and fairly, and asks to be entrusted with it. It will be an interesting test. \n",
      " Absent the appointment of an independent counsel, the department can expect to have the Republican Congress looking over its shoulder. In a case like this, that's what the Republicans ought to do. The fundamental question with regard to these contributions is, What was given in return? The White House isn't telling. Somewhere in the system there has to be an entity that will find out. \n",
      " The broader question, having to do with the system of campaign finance generally, is one that ought to be dealt with legislatively. The president and Congress should create an enforceable system that will limit the role of money in federal elections -- or else should be made to admit that they don't want to do it; then the voters can decide. \n"

      " George Mitchell, the Obama administration's new Middle East envoy, encountered a grim landscape on a tour of the region last week. The conflict between Israel and Hamas continues to simmer; no cease-fire has been agreed to. Moderate Palestinian leaders and U.S. allies such as Saudi Arabia and even Turkey are furious about the heavy loss of life and continuing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But Israel is drifting to the right. The leader in polls for next month's election is Benjamin Netanyahu, who favors postponing an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement indefinitely -- and promises to \"finish the work\" in Gaza. \n",
      " President Obama has already recognized that closing an Israeli-Palestinian deal on a two-state settlement is not a realistic aim for now; instead, he has spoken of providing \"a space where trust can be built.\" How can the United States do that? One way is the to promote economic development in the West Bank, something that Netanyahu supports. Mitchell could also devote himself to constructing a more durable peace in Gaza. \n",
      " Even as it builds confidence, though, the Obama administration needs to show that the United States is still committed to a separate Palestinian state, and to countering those on both sides who are working against it. That means trying to break the links between Hamas and Iran while pushing the Islamic movement to reconcile with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and allow negotiations with Israel. It also means checking Israel's continued expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank -- a practice that threatens to make a two-state solution impossible to implement. \n",
      " A report last week underlined the danger. The Israeli group Peace Now reported that settlement growth in 2008 was 69 percent greater than the previous year -- despite the commitment of outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert to a Palestinian state. Nearly 600 of the 1,500 new structures were outside the security barrier Israel has built through the West Bank, and more than 250 were in the approximately 100 \"outposts\" that the Israeli government has itself declared illegal. Olmert and former prime minister Ariel Sharon repeatedly promised the Bush administration that the outposts would be dismantled and new construction limited to areas that Israel would probably annex as part of a final settlement. Not only did those pledges go unfulfilled, but the West Bank settler population has grown by 35,000, to 285,000, during Olmert's three years in office. \n",
      " Mitchell understands the political as well as the practical importance of settlements. Eight years ago, when he headed an international panel to study the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he concluded that the \"expansion of settlements undermines Palestinians' confidence in Israel's willingness to negotiate ... a viable Palestinian state.\" Mitchell proposed and the Bush administration endorsed a settlement freeze, but President George W. Bush never attempted to obtain Israel's compliance even with its own commitments. By holding the next Israeli government strictly accountable, the Obama administration could send a powerful message to Palestinians and Arab states about its commitment to an agreement -- and, at the same time, preserve the space for it to happen.: [3076, 3025, 2969]\n",

      " The stakes in Honduras's political crisis have always been bigger than the country's tiny size would suggest -- and so it follows that the breakthrough engineered this week by the Obama administration is more than a minor diplomatic triumph. \n",
      " At its root, the fight in Honduras has been over whether Latin American nations will remain committed to upholding liberal democracy and the rule of law, not only at home but for their neighbors. The alliance led by Hugo Chavez is promoting a rival model of populist authoritarianism -- one that Honduras's deposed president, Manuel Zelaya, was attempting to adopt. When the Honduran army arrested Zelaya in June and illegally deported him, it, too, violated democratic norms, thus providing Chavez and his client with a convenient means to rally support. \n",
      " Not just Venezuela's satellites but every other member of the Organization of American States joined in censuring Honduras. The subsequent intransigence of the de facto government of Roberto Micheletti -- and the unthinking support it received from some Republicans in Congress -- only added fuel to Chavez's fire. \n",
      " The beauty of the U.S.-brokered deal is that it is founded on democratic process -- the very thing the Chavistas want to destroy. The Honduran Congress will vote on whether to restore Zelaya to office for the three months remaining in his term. Zelaya says he has the votes to return as president, but if he does, he will head a \"government of reconciliation,\" and the armed forces will report to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, a presidential election previously scheduled for Nov. 29 will go forward with international support and regional recognition for the winner. Neither of the two leading presidential candidates supports Zelaya or his agenda, which means that Honduras's democracy should be preserved, and Chavez's attempted coup rebuffed. \n",
      " Continued U.S. involvement will be needed to ensure that the deal is implemented. If it succeeds, the Obama administration will have the standing -- and the obligation -- to insist that the OAS start paying attention to other breaches of the Inter-American Democratic Charter. A good place to start would be neighboring Nicaragua, where would-be strongman Daniel Ortega is entrenching himself in power through fraudulent elections, corrupt manipulation of the courts and orchestrated violence. \n",
      " In Washington, meanwhile, Republicans such as Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who helped to prolong the Honduran crisis, should have no more excuse to hold up the confirmation of the administration's appointments for Latin American posts. As it happens, the leader of the U.S. delegation in Honduras last week, outgoing Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Shannon, is one of the State Department professionals abused by DeMint. Having recorded the Obama administration's biggest diplomatic success so far, Shannon ought to be allowed to take up his new post as ambassador to Brazil.: [2768, 2729, 2685]\n",

      " The politics of state budgets can be arcane but almost never as peculiar as what goes on in Washington, given the federal government's capacity to run large deficits. State governments stick close to economic realities and to the political mood. Tax cuts usually happen in good times. Taxes tend to go up when the economy turns down, and states find they can't pay their bills from existing revenues. \n",
      " That pattern held again this year, according to a new study by the Center for the Study of the States. It was, modestly speaking, a good year for state taxpayers. Economic growth allowed 30 states to reduce their taxes, while only eight raised them. But tax cuts were modest, amounting to $4.1 billion, about one percent of total state tax revenue. The big-ticket tax cuts in states such as New Jersey and New York have been heralded by tax-cut advocates as the sign of a major trend. The truth is less sweeping: Most states avoided large swipes at their revenues. No doubt that's because certain expenses -- notably for health care and the education of the mini-baby boom now entering school -- remain high. \n",
      " The combination of prudence and good times has left the states as a whole in remarkably strong fiscal condition. The study found that state general funds and rainy-day funds -- which cushion against hard times -- represent a higher proportion of annual spending than at any time since 1980. Even more unusual than the number of tax cuts is the total absence of large tax increases . Not since 1979 and 1980, the study found, have tax increases been so few. \n",
      " Can state taxpayers count on more tax cuts in the coming year? Perhaps in some states, the study found, because budgets are generally in good shape, because fiscal conservatives seem to be in the ascendancy and because states \"did not go overboard in cutting taxes last year.\" But there are two potential obstacles to tax relief. One is perpetual: concern that economic growth may slow down. In addition, many states are worried about what cuts in federal spending will do to their fiscal pictures. The first year or so of the federal budget proposals now before Congress may not cut too much in aid, but the cuts deepen in later years. \n"

      " The president says the era of big government is over, but to judge by his acceptance speech in Chicago the other night, the era of busy government is not. Mr. Clinton said that, if given the chance in a second term, he would have the government: help teach more children to read but keep them from watching the wrong TV shows; take the opening steps toward making 14 years of education as universal as 12 are today; subsidize the creation of additional jobs, particularly for welfare mothers forced off the rolls by the retrograde bill that he himself has just signed; give workers the right to take more family leave when they need it; increase federal support for homeownership; help more people pay the cost of health insurance-and, well, there's more. \n",
      " Yet of course he also promised to balance the budget while protecting such programs as Medicare and Medicaid, which are a principal source of the projected imbalance-and he chided the Republicans for proposing tax cuts that would threaten these central programs even while making a balanced budget impossible. \n",
      " You wonder how it adds up, and the answer is that it doesn't -- but perhaps not in the way you think. Presidents are forever trying to sound simultaneously generous and fiscally responsible in election years. There is always a contradiction, which they then struggle more or less to work out afterward. There is some of that in Mr. Clinton's current case. But the great mismatch with most -- not all -- of his proposals lies in the opposite direction: Not that they would cost some large amount more than he suggests, but that they would likely accomplish less. George Bush only pretended to have more will than wallet; for Mr. Clinton, the affliction is real. \n",
      " Some of what sounded like proposals in his speech weren't really proposals at all -- not for any federal action, at any rate. They were enunciations of goals for others to achieve. The president had a lot to say about education and crime, for example, both of which are primarily areas of state and local responsibility. \"We must give ... all parents the right to choose which public school their children will attend ... let teachers form new charter schools with a charter they can keep only if they do a good job. . . keep our schools open late ... reward teachers that are doing a good job, remove those who don't measure up.\" But state and local officials make those decisions; that's all hortatory on his part. \n",
      " Other proposals sounded large but in fact would be quite small. At the federal level, both parties have fallen into the habit in recent years of using multi-year rather than annual cost estimates in describing proposals. Sometimes it's a useful practice-as when the true cost of a proposal has been backloaded or deferred-but mostly it is confusing, particularly as the number of years keeps changing. You will hear that the president, or someone, is proposing a multibillion-dollar program, which will be true over five or seven years but on an annual basis will amount to much less. The job-creating program the president announced the other day is in this category; so also the tax cut for homeowners on the capital gain from the sale of a home. It's a large glass, but with a false bottom; it turns out not to hold much. \n",
      " On the other hand, there were two ideas in the speech of which the reverse is true. They could turn out to be not less important than they were made to sound, but more so. One is the president's proposal to provide tuition tax breaks to help pay the cost of postsecondary education. The language in which the proposal has been couched has tended to obscure what it would represent-a two-thirds increase, when fully effective, in federal aid to higher education, and for much of the population-all but those with the highest incomes and those too poor to owe taxes-a major new entitlement. The president says it would increase access to higher education and help make the 13th and 14th year of education universal. Our own sense is that it would far more likely end up subsidizing people who would go to college anyway, and, since it would be the government paying, encourage a further increase in college costs. \n",
      " The president also said in the speech that he would return in a second term to the problem of health care insurance, which a seventh of the population continues to lack, in part for reasons of cost. Three years ago he proposed a system of universal health care coverage and lost. He returns as an incrementalist. He said Thursday night that he would at least like to help \"unemployed families keep their health insurance for up to six months.\" Mrs. Clinton, in mentioning the same idea on Tuesday, added, \"And our nation still must find a way to offer affordable health care coverage to the working poor and the 10 million children who lack ... insurance today.\" That would be a major initiative-and in our judgment, a worthy one. Medium government, you might call it, if in fact you think the era of big government is over.: [2438, 2433, 2412]\n",

      "Dick Proutt is a small farmer. A very small one. At Down Branch Farm, he raises chickens and quails and grows lettuce, squash, melons and tomatoes on about an acre. In high summer, his weekly haul might include just five dozen quail eggs, 40 pounds of tomatoes and 20 pounds of squash. \n",
      " The Jefferson Area Board of Aging wants exactly that kind of food for the more than 3,000 meals it serves each week. But it needs 100 pounds of tomatoes, just for one day's worth of salads at its 11 area senior citizen centers. Until now, JABA had only two options: Cobble together an order by making weekly pickups at several local farms, or call a one-stop national distributor. \n",
      " But this month, Proutt's tomatoes showed up in a salad at JABA's Charlottesville day center. Proutt dropped off his harvest at the Local Food Hub, a new nonprofit group that aggregated his produce along with that of 20 other local small farmers and delivered it to JABA's central kitchen. \n",
      " Projects like the Hub are popping up nationwide. And they could be the missing link between supply of and demand for products grown close to home. In Louisville, Grasshoppers Distribution sells the produce of 100 state farmers to 75 restaurants and schools. In Burlington, Vt., the nonprofit Intervale Center is aggregating produce from 20 farmers to sell to individuals and, this winter, to local restaurants, hospitals and universities. In Northern California, the pioneering Growers Collaborative estimates that over the past year it delivered 400 tons of local produce to Kaiser Permanente's 19 regional hospitals. \n",
      " Such networks also are a priority for the Obama administration, which hopes they will improve rural economies and promote healthful eating: \"What we've got to do is change how we think about, for example, getting local farmers connected to school districts because that would benefit the farmers delivering fresh produce,\" Obama told the Organizing for America health-care forum last week. \n",
      " \"There are so many new producers cropping up in America. Their best opportunity to expand is a local market,\" said U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. \"It's enhanced if they can be joined together with other local producers so sufficient quality and quantity can be established for schools, hospitals, jails and other purchasers.\" \n",
      " The Local Food Hub's director, Kate Collier, hadn't intended to get into the wholesale produce business. She and her husband, Eric Gertner, own a gourmet food store here, Feast, and the produce has the lowest profit margins. \n",
      " In April 2008, Collier spoke to a panel convened by local food advocates, outlining how a new distribution system could support small farmers. \"I told them, `This is where I see the holes are,' \" she said. \"Everybody jumped on the idea. They said if there was one phone number to call, they'd do it.\" \n",
      " Collier raised $305,000 from local foundations and individuals, established a nonprofit group and hired a staff of five. She leased a 3,100-square-foot warehouse and bought a refrigerated truck and $3 million in liability insurance, a requirement to sell to large institutions. \n",
      " The Hub began deliveries in July. Proutt, of Down Branch Farm, was the first to sign up. The former cabinetmaker, whose business had dried up with the building bust, decided to try farming and sold at the Charlottesville farmers market last spring. \n",
      " \"It was neat to talk to people. But for us, we have so much work to do out here, it was a waste of time. We can make more money in the morning with one delivery,\" Proutt said. \n",
      " Larger farms also see benefits. By selling to the Hub, Roundabout Farm's Megan Weary spends more time farming and less time marketing and delivering. \n",
      " For example, working with a company such as Whole Foods Market requires a mountain of paperwork. Weary has sold to the high-end grocer since 2006. This summer, it took six weeks to get her heirloom tomatoes into stores. \n",
      " \"It's not a waste of my time. But the six weeks I spent chasing Whole Foods is six weeks I could have been selling them tomatoes,\" Weary said. \"So the Food Hub does two things: They consolidate my deliveries, which makes my life easier, and they consolidate the time it takes to build relationships with those bigger buyers.\" \n",
      " After six weeks in business, the Hub had signed up 30 customers, including independent grocery stores, restaurants and schools. Collier is negotiating to sell to the University of Virginia dining services, run by food service behemoth Aramark. \n",
      " But the Hub can't compete on price. National distributors and food service providers scan daily commodity market prices. In high season, zucchini sells for about 40 cents a pound; the Hub sells it for 94 cents a pound. And that 40-cents-a-pound zucchini can come washed, chopped and bagged. \n",
      " \"It's a huge change for institutions,\" said Judy Berger, JABA's community nutrition manager. \"When you fix thousands of meals, you want the quickest, easiest way to do it. Food from California that's prepped and ready to go is, for crazy reasons, less expensive.\" \n",
      " Some institutions are willing to stomach the changes. JABA, for example, preps local produce for all its centers in its catering kitchen. And it directs proceeds from catering to cover higher produce prices. But regional distributor Cavalier Produce, which sells the Hub's specialty items such as squash blossoms and purple potatoes to chefs, Cavalier can purchase tomatoes from other Virginia farmers farther afield at the height of tomato season for less than half of what the Hub would charge. \n",
      " \"We're trying to make it work, but we have to stay at the market price,\" said Spencer Morris, Cavalier's general manager. \"If I went out to my customers at double the price, I'd lose business.\" \n",
      " Local distributors have one competitive advantage: The Hub knows the source of every item it delivers, a plus in an era of regular (ital) E. coli (end ital) outbreaks. Still, it's difficult to turn a profit. \n",
      " \"The distribution business is about economies of scale,\" says Josh Edge, farm-to-institution manager at the seven-year-old Growers Collaborative in California. \"We can't compete with the national guys.\" In 2006 the Collaborative tried to operate as a for-profit corporation but returned to nonprofit status last year. \n",
      " The Obama administration plans to help. The Department of Agriculture is required to put at least 5 percent of its business and industry budget into developing local production. \"That's the floor,\" Vilsack said. \"What we're looking at is how can we more effectively use (those funds) to create a whole new way of thinking about the rural economy. Be assured it's one of our priorities.\" \n",
      " Collier projects that the Hub could turn a profit with revenue of $1.5 million annually. If all goes well, that could happen in six to eight years. Meanwhile, small farmers are taking advantage of the opportunity to find broad and steady markets for their products. \n"

A Henrico County, Va., man said that he and five other VMI freshmen were hit about twice a week over the course of a month last fall, and he is seeking criminal charges against the three seniors who struck him. \n",

The documents, normally secret, were provided to The Washington Post by the freshmen's lawyers. \n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: \n",
      " With the presidential campaign clock ticking down, Sen. John McCain has suddenly discovered a new boogeyman to link to Sen. Barack Obama: a sometimes controversial but widely respected Middle East scholar named Rashid Khalidi. In the past couple of days, McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, have likened Khalidi, the director of a Middle East institute at Columbia University, to neo-Nazis; called him \"a PLO spokesman\"; and suggested that the Los Angeles Times is hiding something sinister by refusing to release a videotape of a 2003 dinner in honor of Khalidi at which Obama spoke. McCain even threw former Weatherman Bill Ayers into the mix, suggesting that the tape might reveal that Ayers -- a terrorist-turned-professor who also has been an Obama acquaintance -- was at the dinner. \n",
      " For the record, Khalidi is an American born in New York who graduated from Yale a couple of years after George W. Bush. For much of his long academic career, he taught at the University of Chicago, where he and his wife became friends with Barack and Michelle Obama. In the early 1990s, he worked as an adviser to the Palestinian delegation at peace talks in Madrid and Washington sponsored by the first Bush administration. We don't agree with a lot of what Khalidi has had to say about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict over the years, and Obama has made clear that he doesn't, either. But to compare the professor to neo-Nazis -- or even to Ayers -- is a vile smear. \n",
      " Perhaps unsurprising for a member of academia, Khalidi holds complex views. In an article published this year in the Nation magazine, he scathingly denounced Israeli practices in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and U.S. Middle East policy but also condemned Palestinians for failing to embrace a nonviolent strategy. He said that the two-state solution favored by the Bush administration (and Obama) was \"deeply flawed\" but conceded there were also \"flaws in the alternatives.\" Listening to Khalidi can be challenging -- as Obama put it in the dinner toast recorded on the 2003 tape and reported by the Times in a detailed account of the event last April, he \"offers constant reminders to me of my own blind spots and my own biases.\" \n",
      " It's fair to question why Obama felt as comfortable as he apparently did during his Chicago days in the company of men whose views diverge sharply from what the presidential candidate espouses. Our sense is that Obama is a man of considerable intellectual curiosity who can hear out a smart, if militant, advocate for the Palestinians without compromising his own position. To suggest, as McCain has, that there is something reprehensible about associating with Khalidi is itself condemnable -- especially during a campaign in which Arab ancestry has been the subject of insults. To further argue that the Times, which obtained the tape from a source in exchange for a promise not to publicly release it, is trying to hide something is simply ludicrous, as McCain surely knows. \n",
      " Which reminds us: We did ask Khalidi whether he wanted to respond to the campaign charges against him. He answered, via e-mail, that \"I will stick to my policy of letting this idiot wind blow over.\" That's good advice for anyone still listening to the McCain campaign's increasingly reckless ad hominem attacks. Sadly, that wind is likely to keep blowing for four more days.: [2952, 2903, 2861]\n",

      "Sharon Rena Lopatka and Robert Glass exchanged sexually explicit e-mail messages for nearly eight weeks between August and October and didn't stop until four days before her death in a broken-down trailer 500 miles from her Hampstead, Md., home, law enforcement sources said Thursday. \n",
      " Lopatka, 35, who investigators believe arranged her own death on the Internet, used a series of identities in hundreds of e-mail messages to Glass, 45, a father of three who worked as a computer analyst for Catawba County. \n",
      " Lopatka called herself \"Nancy\" and \"Sharon\" during routine e-mail conversations. But when she talked about sex, torture, bondage and death, and began role-playing about strange sexual acts, she slipped into a different identity, a law enforcement source said. \n",
      " She called herself \"Miranda.\" \n",
      " New details in the unusual case emerged Thursday as a judge issued a gag order barring those familiar with events in the small town of Lenoir, N.C., from speaking publicly about what they know. \n",
      " North Carolina Superior Court Judge Beverly T. Beal also ordered that all records filed after he issued his order at noon be sealed and kept from the public. There was no advance notice of the hearing, held in his chambers. \n",
      " The judge would not talk publicly about his order Thursday night, saying state rules of judicial conduct prevent him from doing so. \n",
      " Glass has been charged with murder in Lopatka's death. Investigators say the messages between the two became increasingly sexual and violent, and they believe she took an Amtrak train to North Carolina to be sexually tortured and killed. \n",
      " Lopatka even left a note for her husband. \n",
      " \"If my body is never retrieved,\" she told him, \"don't worry.\" \n",
      " But her body was retrieved last week, in a 3Â½-foot deep hole about 70 feet from Glass's run-down trailer, which was stuck in the middle of a weed-filled yard. A ribbon of yellow crime tape was still strung to the door Thursday. \n",
      " Dr. Robert Thompson, associate chief medical examiner of North Carolina, said an autopsy did not reveal any new wounds or old scars that would suggest Lopatka was sexually or physically tortured. He said he was aware of reports claiming she had been strangled by a piece of rope, but did not find any bruises or marks on her neck. \n",
      " Thompson said the autopsy did not determine how Lopatka died, but he said findings were consistent with someone who had been asphyxiated. \n",
      " According to court records, interviews and law enforcement sources, Lopatka, who started a business with an Internet site and 900 numbers, began a cyberspace relationship with Glass during the final week of August. \n",
      " E-mail messages -- retrieved from her personal computer by the Maryland State Police with specially designed software -- became more and more explicit, with Lopatka and Glass writing about bondage and domination. Investigators say the two appeared to be role-playing. \n",
      " The messages ended Oct. 12, the day before Lopatka headed south. Her husband, Victor Lopatka, reported her disappearance Oct. 20, and the state police started to investigate. The messages led investigators to Glass and his trailer in Lenoir. \n",
      " Glass's attorney said Thursday that Lopatka's death was an accident and his client plans to plead not guilty to the murder charges. \n",
      " \"It is my understanding that they were involved in sexual intercourse, and she accidentally died,\" attorney Neil Beach said before the gag order took effect. \n",

      " Richard Tyler, coming off a strong fall season for Anne Klein, must sense that his customers are ready for more action, though from the unforgiving cut of his slim satin skirts and molded jackets they may just need more oxygen. Monday's show was daring in many ways: Here was a designer, known for his classic tailoring and dressmaker details, flirting with innuendo and sexual danger. \n",
      " Clearly inspired by '70s fashion, with its frankly sleazy overtones, Tyler poured his models into pink shorts and lavender pants, so tight that the emphasis was all on the rear. There were darted jackets over darted skirts, pastel cropped cardigans over Shantung capri pants and tone-on-tone combinations of petrol-blue iridescent sharkskin and lavender boucle houndstooth. The models wore ankle-strapped stilettos and swung little purses on long plastic chains, though one couldn't help thinking they'd be better off with a hit man as an accessory. \n",
      " It's hard to believe that very many women will infer sexual empowerment from clothes that, to most men, still imply sexual domination. But Tyler is at least willing to risk that women are ready for more ambiguity in their clothes, and there is a lot to be said for the way he underplayed serious suits with shiny fabrics and pastel colors. His strongest statements were made in matte jersey -- the most convincing aspect of '70s revivalism; and the wrap dress, along with the keyhole jumpsuit, may once again make women feel like dancing. \n",
      " Eisen's clothes are so basic in their styling -- two-button jackets over tank tops and straight-cut trousers -- that he could easily be accused of not trying. This anti-fashion formula owes a lot to Helmut Lang, the Austrian designer whose minimalism is inventive but (lucky for Eisen) costly and poorly distributed. Eisen did not move much beyond the master's mark Monday, but with workmanlike dispatch he covered the trends: narrow-waisted jackets over bustiers and hot pants; laminated chiffons, polished linens and sparkle crepes that studiously hinted of synthetics; beltless trousers that hugged the hips; and lots of white viscose mixed with skinny belts and patent leather mules. \n",
      " What was defeating about the show was its underlying attitude of self-importance, as though only an insider could possibly understand the coolness of wearing a slinky pair of sparkle crepe trousers with a baby-blue tube top. This sort of disaffected glamour may be hip, but in America, it's hardly original. \n",
      " Geoffrey Beene tends to lead where others follow. His show Monday was something of a homage to the American summer: breezy linen coats inset with tiny strips of chiffon; smock dresses in printed cotton and white pique; sling-back gowns and high-waisted jumpsuits in matte jersey. \n",
      " Titled \"Santa Monica Forward,\" the collection was all about simplicity and movement, with Beene's signature slip dresses performing like a second skin of lace and chiffon. The triangular bodice of a black gown resembled sails pulled taut in the wind, while his colors -- sea-foam green, peach, mango and lemon -- suggested a tall, tropical drink. A pink jumpsuit came drenched with a stole of clear, pastel paillettes. A navy bolero lapped over a white jersey jumpsuit, while another bolero, in pin-striped flannel, was embroidered with two wedges of watermelon over the breasts. Less tempting were Beene's many short hemlines, which, just shy of the bottom, were too abbreviated to be easy.: [2677, 2675, 2653]\n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: \n",
      " For months, the Federal Communications Commission has been weighing what to do, if anything, about allegations that Comcast Corp. blocked users from employing BitTorrent, an application that allows peer-to-peer sharing of videos. Comcast critics say the company targeted the technology and tried to stop its use because BitTorrent could dig into Comcast's market for selling videos; they want the FCC to force Comcast to stop and are pushing for legislation that would more closely regulate Internet service providers (ISPs). Comcast counters that it was simply engaged in reasonable management of its networks after finding that users of BitTorrent were slowing operations for everyone on the network; the effects, the company says, were particularly noticeable during peak use hours. Comcast vigorously opposes new regulation, arguing that it is unnecessary and potentially harmful. \n",
      " ISPs, both those working via cable and those using telephone lines, have poured billions of dollars into building their networks, leading to broader and better service for consumers. These companies have a right to manage their networks; just as important, consumers have a right to know what kind of service they are receiving and whether a particular product or application can be used on their ISPs' network. Full disclosure by the ISPs of major network management decisions would go a long way toward addressing this conflict. Disclosure of this type respects the best aspects of a free market: The ISPs make business decisions they believe are necessary, consumers are empowered to make decisions about whether to switch to competing services, and the FCC gets information it needs to ensure that ISPs don't infringe on the freedoms that make the Internet such a powerful tool for entertainment, communications and commerce. \n",
      " In this case, disclosure of Comcast's policy led the company to declare it would change. Comcast's alleged transgression was discovered after months of research by a diligent Comcast user who spread the word through -- no surprise -- a Web site. Interest groups picked up on the matter and soon Internet and more mainstream media were reporting on it. Comcast and BitTorrent have since formed an agreement to work together. This solution could have -- and should have -- come earlier if the company had voluntarily disclosed its policy right away. \n",
      " Testimony given in April by FCC Chairman Kevin Martin suggests the commission is on the right path. While acknowledging the power of ISPs and the potential for mischief, Martin has repeatedly said that no new regulations are needed because the FCC already has the legal authority it needs to police ISPs and ensure they don't overstep the bounds of legitimate network management. He has also called for more transparency from the companies and pushed for increased disclosures to consumers. Comcast and the other ISPs that would like to avoid a potential regulatory morass would be smart to start robust compliance with this very reasonable demand.: [3006, 2971, 2930]\n",

      "In a small gym off a winding suburban road one recent morning, a dozen self-described soccer moms and 40-somethings clad in stretchy workout wear waited eagerly for the command \"Move your boombsey!\" \n",
      " They all but cheered when a tiny, muscle-hewn woman swept through a side glass door. \"There she is!\" one shouted. \n",
      " Soon, Kukuwa Nuamah was shouting back in husky-voiced, West African-accented commands over blasting music -- smiling while demanding the women shimmy and twirl and, most crucially, move their boombseys. They happily obliged, breathlessly shaking their backsides. \n",
      " \"We come here and have our Beyonce moments,\" Tressa Bennett, 40, said while defogging her glasses after class. \n",
      " The women were doing dances that have perpetually swirled through Nuamah's head while growing up in Ghana, while translating documents at the World Bank. Today, those moves have evolved into a high-octane African-Latin-Caribbean workout offered to the masses via DVD and public access television and in classes at offices and gyms on three continents -- North America, Europe and Asia -- where instructors preach the trademarked doctrine of Kukuwa: \"Move your boombsey!\" \n",
      " The workout has turned Nuamah into a one-name wonder on the Washington region's fitness circuit. At 49, Nuamah feels on the brink of becoming fitness's next star. \n",
      " \"I'm like a plane on a runway,\" Nuamah said. \"And I've just been given permission to take off.\" \n",
      " The finicky fitness world, of course, is ever-ripe for new trends; witness the rise of Billy Blanks' Tae Bo, the current craze for Latin-inspired Zumba and the quick fall of pole-dancing classes. Nuamah said people want something new and pointed out that there is little in the way of African-inspired workouts. Experts say dance-style workouts are hot, though not exactly in short supply. \n",
      " \"That's the American dream -- to be able to do what you love, what you're passionate about, and to hopefully make some money from it,\" said Tom Perkins, president of the New Hampshire-based company Fitness Industry Solutions. But Perkins, who had not heard of Nuamah, warned, \"From the business side, there's a lot of stuff out there.\" \n",
      " More than 100 people have passed the Kukuwa instructor certification course and teach hundreds of classes a week in the Washington region, and in Japan and Spain. Two cruise lines offer packages for Kukuwa followers, who burn off pina colada calories in free classes with Nuamah. On her Web site, Nuamah sells workout gear printed with African symbols. At least 10,000 copies of her DVDs have been sold on Amazon.com and other sites, she said. \n",
      " Her office is the basement of her suburban townhouse, which is for sale. Nuamah and her husband have decided to sell and pour more money into the business, which so far has not turned a profit. \n",
      " \"People say it takes 10 years,\" said Nuamah, her hair cropped short and her lips painted pink. \n",
      " That is how long ago Nuamah quit her day job to focus on her workout. But the seed was planted decades before. \n",
      " One of seven children born to a minister and a baker, Nuamah never studied dance; no one did in Ghana, she said. She simply copied traditional dances and made up her own, earning several dance competition titles. \n",
      " \"It was pure talent,\" she said. \"When you're good, you're good.\" \n",
      " Ghana's ethnic languages also came easily and intuitively, she said. As a child, Nuamah spent weekends at her French teacher's house, becoming fluent in that tongue. \n",
      " At 16, she left for work in the Ivory Coast, then for university studies in Paris. In 1980, she followed a boyfriend to the Washington area. Soon she was working as a French-English translator at the World Bank, where she started giving \"funk\" dance classes to colleagues. She married a Ghanaian engineer and moved to New Jersey, then New York, and kept teaching at community centers and in her basement, where she would pack in 80 people. She called it \"Le Physique.\" \n",
      " \"They loved it. People were losing weight and staying in shape -- men, women and children,\" Nuamah said. \n",
      " \"One fine day\" 10 years ago, she recalled, she was back in Washington, working an administrative job at George Washington University, when her boss told her she should quit. He knew she wanted only to dance. \n",
      " She quit and hit the area's gyms. She lined up gigs to teach her workout -- to which she added African moves, and then Latin and Caribbean -- more than 40 times a week. \n",
      " Five years later, she wrote a manual for her workout so she could hire instructors. A business adviser told her she should pick a \"catchy\" African name for the class. \n",
      " \"Then, ding!\" Nuamah said. \"A light went off in my mind: Kukuwa!\" \n",
      " Nuamah also wanted a slogan that would make people shake their rears. Being a linguist -- she says she speaks about seven languages in addition to French -- she scoured the globe's tongues for a \"cuter\" reference to that part of the anatomy. She found it in the Caribbean: boombsey. \n",
      " \"I like that, rather than `Move your buttocks,' \" Nuamah said. \"Boombsey is pretty. It's professional.\" \n",
      " Nuamah's students say they are believers. \n",
      " \"Not growing up shaking like that, it took a while to get used to,\" retiree Phyllis Wolfe, 54, said after the Great Falls class. \"But it's wonderful for the middle. Plus, there's her personality.\" \n",
      " Nuamah still teaches about three classes a day. \n"

      " The Department of Homeland Security recently announced a plan to do what many scientists had once thought impossible: effectively inspect large numbers of vehicles entering a major metropolitan area for radioactive materials without bringing life to a standstill. In the 1950s, a still-classified report on the possibility of scanning for nuclear materials found that detectors could be easily defeated, one of its authors recently told US News & World Report. Experts today say that the nuclear weapons are heavily shielded, making detection tricky, and that current front-line scanners have difficulty in reliably detecting even those nuclear materials not encased in a bomb. \n",
      " Nevertheless, DHS is pushing forward with a pilot program to test the feasibility of scanning large numbers of cars and trucks entering Manhattan for radioactivity. \n",
      " The goal is to set up a system of both fixed and mobile scanners on roads leading into Manhattan. The system would require little or no slowdown in traffic to operate. Fixed detectors might be placed at tollbooths and other traffic choke points. Mobile scanners might be used to conduct random checks. Ideally, this program would add another layer of security to the nuclear detection regimes at border crossings and seaports. If successful, it would require little or no effort from those being inspected, so it wouldn't snarl traffic in the tri-state area. Another point in its favor is that the pilot program is not very expensive, as Homeland Security projects go, and that even if the resulting system is not perfect, it will foster development of newer and better technologies that will make Americans safer. \n",
      " Even given all that, however, we are glad Homeland Security is not breaking the bank on its latest experiment. Based on the available information on the inconsistency of nuclear detection technology, it is fair to wonder whether this is the right time to conduct such a large-scale test and whether such a program may be an inefficient use of government resources.: [3318, 3277, 3191]\n",

      "Federal Aviation Administrator David R. Hinson Wednesday unveiled a plan to reorganize the FAA, enhancing the status of safety-related managers and making it easier to spin off air traffic control functions to a nongovernment corporation if Congress agrees. \n",
      " Hinson said the reorganization follows a \"line of business\" approach that packages major functions under the same administrators rather than having them spread about the agency. The FAA's six basic functions -- air traffic, research and acquisitions, regulation and certification, airports, security and administration -- each will fall under an associate administrator who reports directly to Hinson. \n",
      " Hinson said this will streamline the agency's bureaucracy, reduce the number of people who report to him and clarify who is responsible for what function. \n",
      " Under the new plan, Anthony J. Broderick, associate administrator for regulation and certification, will report directly to Hinson rather than going through Monte Belger, executive director for system operations. Belger, in turn, will become the associate administrator in charge of air traffic services. \n",
      " Broderick, who has been with the FAA for many years, will oversee almost all the FAA's safety functions. \n",
      " Hinson said a new system safety office also will report directly to him. While Broderick's office will handle day-by-day safety matters, the new system safety officer will take a more long-term view, becoming Hinson's \"right hand for early indicators in the safety area.\" \n",
      " The system safety officer, yet to be named, will set up new computer systems to sort through daily international airline safety data and function as a worldwide civil aviation database that could be culled quickly for specific subjects. \n",
      " \"We want to look at where problems are coming from before they become problems,\" Hinson said. \n",
      " All assistant administrators and chief counsel Mark Gerchick will continue in their posts with the same duties, although a deputy administrator for diversity will be added to the office of Leon Watkins, the assistant administrator for civil rights. \n",
      " A key part of the reorganization is to prepare the FAA to spin off air traffic control functions to a corporation if Congress should choose to do so. Legislation to form \"ATC Inc.,\" as some call it, which is short for \"Air Traffic Control Inc.,\" stalled in the last Congress, but the administration will make another effort in the new GOP Congress. \n",
      " All air traffic services functions, from controllers to weather and flight inspection, have been combined under Belger. All acquisition and hardware functions, including communications and navigation aids, have been combined under Associate Administrator George Donohue. \n",

      " For Chez Panisse, it was only one of many firsts. Alice Waters and her restaurant set the tone for the restaurant revolution that swept across the country in the 1980s. \n",
      " From the Union Square Cafe in New York to the Clydes' group of restaurants in Washington, D.C., the enduring influence of her \"fresh from the farm\" philosophy is still alive and well. \n",
      " From its Berkeley, Calif., location, Chez Panisse was able to take advantage of the bountiful produce of northern California. Dinner at the restaurant was an evening spent eating a meal planned from start to finish -- the menu changed daily. \n",
      " This practice, common in Europe, was a fresh idea for restaurant-goers accustomed to a la carte menus. Chez Panisse had the additional advantage of attracting talented young chefs who were able to take this concept and excel. \n",
      " The Waters-Chez Panisse philosophy has been well articulated in the many books she has authored or co-authored. Unlike many restaurant books, the straightforward approach to cooking and menu planning in almost all of these efforts is easily duplicated by any home cook with experience and access to a good farmers' market. \n",

The philosophy of the restaurant, what the goals were and are, and the menu concept that has been so central to its success are all explained here. This is more a book to be read on lazy afternoons than a collection of recipes. Home cooks often grapple with the problem of how to put together a menu in which the courses mix well with one another. Here's a book filled with wonderful examples. \n",
      " CHEZ PANISSE VEGETABLES by Alice Waters (HarperCollins, $32.50): Fresh vegetables are at the heart of any meal at Chez Panisse. Many books do a better job of giving the basics of vegetable cookery, and Waters would be the first to tell you to look to classic cookbooks for that kind of information. But this is the Chez Panisse look at vegetables -- how Waters feels vegetables should be chosen and handled. Waters's prescription: Do it lovingly and with respect. This book has many recipes; the most useful are the ones that simply describe the way to make a quick saute or a beautiful salad. \n",
      " FANNY AT CHEZ PANISSE by Alice Waters (HarperCollins, $23): This lighthearted, behind-the-scenes look at Chez Panisse is told from a child's point of view. The child is Fanny, Waters's daughter, and she has the best seat in town. Charming and engaging, this book will delight adults and children alike. \n",
      " CHEZ PANISSE PASTA, PIZZA AND CALZONE by Alice Waters, Patricia Curtan Martine Labro (Random House, $14): Despite the limited subject matter, this book teaches Waters's philosophy of everyday cooking in the simplicity of the recipes.

      "The headline of Thomas Friedman's column in this morning's New York Times reads, \"How to Make America Stupid.\" Friedman is reacting to Rudy Giuliani's rallying cry at the Republican National Convention: \"Drill, baby, drill!\" \n",
      " \"Why would Republicans,\" he writes in what we might call classic Friedman-ese, a tone best accompanied by beating the forehead with one's open palm, \"the party of business, want to focus our country on breathing life into a 19th-century-technology -- fossil fuels -- rather than giving birth to a 21st-century technology -- renewable energy?\" \n",
      " This is also the tone of Friedman's \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded: Why We Need a Green Revolution and How It Can Renew America\" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux: 438 pps., $27.95), a book so combustible it makes a reader want to skip the palm of the hand altogether and bang the offending forehead against the nearest power line. In other words, it is Friedman's column times 438 (the number of pages in the book). Here's the gist -- Americans are facing five critical issues created by our dependence on fossil fuels: increased demand for energy, biodiversity loss, climate change, energy poverty and the transfer of wealth to oil-rich nations whose politics (human rights, distribution of wealth, treatment of females) are often less than commendable. Dependence on oil, Friedman contends, has negative effects on both the freedoms we associate with democracy and on innovation. \n",
      " What we need is a Green Revolution. This is our chance to show the rest of the world how to create a sustainable future. And we are blowing it. We have the knowledge, Friedman believes, but we lack the political will. We need leaders who are willing to make ending dependence on fossil fuels a priority. We need leaders who are willing to use tax incentives and other mechanisms to encourage innovation and help shape the market, leaders who are willing to invest government money in clean energy research. Recycling and buying green products is all well and good, but what we have now, he believes, is a flimsy excuse for a Green Movement -- we have a Green Party. \"We need leaders,\" Friedman writes, \"not lightbulbs.\" \n",
      " Of course, Friedman travels so much he must have the biggest carbon footprint in the country. When asked about this, he says, \"Hey, I'm a work in progress.\" A few hours before he's due to speak at the 92nd Street Y on Manhattan's Upper East Side, he visits an exhibit on the life and work of legendary innovator Buckminster Fuller at the Whitney Museum on Madison Avenue. Friedman takes his exercise wherever he can get it, which is why he's game to go. \n",
      " Along the way, he talks about what first set him on fire. For Friedman, it all began in 1968, when he was in 10th grade, with two separate experiences: He took a journalism class and his parents took him to Israel. \"It was my first time on an airplane,\" he recalls. \"It was my first time out of the country. I was blown away. Remember, this was post-1967 -- an incredibly heroic phase in Israel's history.\" \n",
      " Friedman spent the next three summers living on a kibbutz. He took Arabic in college and majored in Mediterranean studies at Brandeis. When he was 19, his father died. \"Losing my father,\" he says, \"made me focus. It made me a more serious person.\" \n",
      " Friedman is nothing if not serious. He received a master of philosophy degree in modern Middle Eastern studies from Oxford. He then went to work for UPI, reporting on OPEC as a global force. In 1981, he landed at the New York Times, where he became Beirut, Lebanon, bureau chief in 1982 and Jerusalem bureau chief in 1984. He has won three Pulitzer Prizes and knows more about the oil business than any living writer, inside or outside academia. \n",
      " According to Friedman, his new book is a perfect storm of ideas that have been brewing in his mind for several years. His 2005 book, \"The World Is  Flat,\" about the rising international middle class and the environmental effects of increased consumption, was an enormous success. U.S. News & World Report named him one of America's Best Leaders, an unusual honor for a journalist. He worked on several documentaries about oil for the Discovery Channel. The work of Al Gore, the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and his wife's involvement as a board member of Conservation International brought issues of global warming into focus. \n",
      " \"I had this pregnant moment a year ago in May at a conference in Aspen (Colo.),\" Friedman recalls. \"I realized that the IT revolution would inevitably be replaced by the ET (energy technology) revolution.\" It was then that he began to understand that America faced a momentous opportunity. He decided to write \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded.\" \n",
      " (Begin optional trim) \n",
      " Friedman works by his own idiosyncratic process: speeches, followed by columns and articles, usually written on airplanes, followed by books. \"I am a verbal person,\" he admits. \"I talk my ideas out.\" He gestures as he walks through the Fuller exhibit, looking at the dymaxion car and the models for domes and dymaxion houses. \n",
      " \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded\" contains a chapter envisioning a day in the life of an American in 20 E.C.E., the Energy Climate Era.

      " It might seem odd for someone like Friedman -- who initially supported the Iraq war and is something of a political centrist -- to write a book about the necessity of going green. But he bristles at the idea that readers expect a columnist to be all left or all right all the time. \"I wrestled long and hard with the Iraq war,\" he says. \"I am not a political animal. I describe my political position as Americanism. Buffettism. Everything I've gotten I've gotten because I was born in the United States at this time in history. My whole focus is on preserving that America.\" \n",
      " His voice rises as he talks about what drives him as a thinker. \"I don't start with `what is the liberal position.' I start with `what's right for America,'\" he continues. \"I'm a real free trader. I believe in high taxes. I saw what happened in Beirut. I saw panic in the streets and people dying -- cars going 80 miles an hour backwards. This is not just about the environment. If we lose this opportunity, it's going to be a different world for your kids and mine. We have exactly enough time starting now.\" \n",
      " Later that night, at the 92nd Street Y, people are scalping tickets to Friedman's talk. It's an older, predominantly white crowd, and he opens with a compliment: \"If it wasn't the 92nd Street Y, it wouldn't be a book.\" But where he really hits his stride is when he begins describing his ideas about the green movement: \"It's not a real revolution unless someone gets hurt.\" \n",
      " Friedman tells the audience that his ideal presidential ticket would be former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and Warren Buffett. He outlines his wish list: 30 percent of America's energy from American-made solar power by 2050, tax credits for companies making renewable energy products and for consumers buying them, a smart electron grid, nuclear power and leaders who believe in innovative technologies rather than voting against them in Congress. On stage, he paces back and forth, answering questions from one side of the hall and then the other. \n",

      "Sen. John F. Kerry sharply criticized President Bush on Thursday night for what he called the president's \"colossal error in judgment\" in handling Iraq, even as the senator vigorously defended himself against Bush's accusations that his positions have shifted with the political winds. \n",
      " In a 90-minute debate on foreign policy and homeland security, the first of four campaign duels, Kerry acknowledged having made verbal missteps in discussing Iraq. But he said his stumbles paled by comparison with the president's failures in managing the war in Iraq and its growing bloodshed. \n",
      " \"I made a mistake in how I talk about the war, but the president made a mistake in invading Iraq, which is worse,\" the senator said. Kerry charged that the president jilted America's allies and rushed to war, thereby diverting attention from the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the struggle against global terrorism. \n",
      " But Bush, using the stark terms he favors, never stayed on the defensive for long. He conceded that there were problems on the ground in Iraq but argued that he was the candidate strong and steady enough to tackle them successfully. \n",
      " \"I've shown the American people I know how to lead,\" Bush said. \"I understand everybody in this country doesn't agree with the decisions I've made, and I made some tough decisions. But people know where I stand. People out there listening know what I believe, and that's how best it is to keep the peace.\" \n",
      " Kerry, under intense pressure as he lags behind in national polls, seemed to hold his own against Bush and to keep the president on the defensive on Iraq and terrorism -- the issues on which Bush has enjoyed his strongest advantages. Known as a strong \"closer\" throughout his political career, Kerry stayed clear of the florid rhetorical flourishes and verbose replies for which he has earned a reputation during nearly 20 years in the Senate. \n",
      " The president repeatedly sought to turn Kerry's words against him. He accused the Democratic challenger of sending \"mixed messages.\" And Bush returned several times to an assertion Kerry made last month that Iraq is \"the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" \n",
      " Bush sought to contrast what he called his steady, consistent leadership -- even in the face of opposition and criticism -- to Kerry's approach. \n",
      " \"I don't see how you can lead this country to success in the war in Iraq if you say `wrong war, wrong place, wrong time,' \" Bush said. \"The way to win this is to be steadfast and resolved.\" \n",
      " Criticized by Kerry for failing to engage allies in the fight against Saddam Hussein, Bush turned the question back on his opponent. \n",
      " \"What's the message going to be?\" to U.S. allies, Bush asked rhetorically, adding a dose of sarcasm: \" `Please join us in Iraq for a grand diversion? Join us for a war that is the wrong war at the wrong place at the wrong time?' \" \n",
      " Bush argued that Kerry's \"core convictions keep changing because of politics But the Democratic senator asserted that the president blundered in failing to build solid international alliances before the invasion of Iraq. \n",
      " \"They outsourced the job to Afghan warlords, who only a week earlier had been on the other side fighting against us, neither of whom trusted each other,\" Kerry said. \n",
      " The first of the debates, held on the University of Miami's campus, focused on issues that polls show weigh heavily on the minds of voters and that carry hefty stakes for both candidates. \n",
      " The war in Iraq has been a defining issue for Bush, who painted it as the central front in the war on terrorism and points to Saddam's ouster as a crowning achievement of his term. \n",
      " The conflict in Iraq has defined Kerry's candidacy too, in a very different way. The Massachusetts Democrat has struggled to explain his position on the war in Iraq, feeding Bush's accusations that he is a \"flip-flopper\" with a series of contradictory statements on the conflict. \n",
      " \"What is misleading is to say you can lead and succeed in Iraq if you keep changing your positions on this war, and he has,\" Bush said of Kerry. \"As the politics change, his positions change, and that's not how a commander in chief acts.\" \n",
      " Kerry delivered his clearest statements yet about his position on the war in Iraq, accusing Bush of mistaking consistency for good leadership. \n",
      " \"It's one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and be wrong,\" Kerry said. \"Certainty sometimes can get you in trouble.\" \n",
      " \"Saddam Hussein is a threat,\" Kerry said. \"He needed to be disarmed. We needed to go to the U.N. The president needed the authority to use force in order to be able to get him to do something, because he never did it without the threat of force. But we didn't need to rush to war without a plan to win the peace.\" \n",
      " Later in the debate, the candidates shifted from Iraq, touching on other international challenges. They sparred most passionately about North Korea and its pursuit of nuclear weapons. \n",
      " Kerry charged that Bush's decision to withdraw from bilateral talks with North Korean caused South Korea's president to leave Washington \"bewildered\" after a meeting with Bush. He called on the president to resume those talks. \n",
      " Bush insisted that bilateral talks were the wrong strategy and that it was best to remain involved in broader talks that include China, South Korea and Japan. Bush said bilateral negotiations would play directly into North Korean President Kim Jong Il's hand because they would mean he would be free of direct pressure from China and the other nations to halt his nuclear weapons program. Despite lingering anxiety and disillusionment among voters about Bush's handling of the Iraq war, and a steady stream of recent violence and bloodshed there, surveys show that voters are far more likely to trust the president to deal with Iraq than they are Kerry. \n",
      " Kerry made an aggressive attempt Thursday night to turn that tide against Bush, accusing the president of making the country less safe by opting to rush to war against Iraq rather than focusing on hunting down Osama bin Laden and battling terrorism. \n",
      " Kerry sought to tie what he called Bush's foreign policy failures to domestic problems, faulting him for spending millions in Iraq that could be going to health care and education at home, and accusing the president of creating a hornet's nest in Iraq that has spooked the oil markets, causing gas prices to balloon. \n",
      " Bush allies said the president would seek to drive home to voters the message that he has been a consistent leader since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, even in the face of tough circumstances. \n",
      " Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla. said Bush was speaking not to the majority of either party, but to undecided voters -- \"that 10 percent that are in the middle, that we've got to reassure about the president's leadership.\" \n",
      " \"Even if you don't agree with his policies,\" Ros-Lehtinen said of the president, \"he has been consistent.\" \n",
      " The stark difference in style between Bush and Kerry was on clear display Thursday night as the two faced off from behind podiums on the stage of the university's Convocation Center before an audience of roughly 600, and a television viewing audience of as many as 50 million. \n",
      " PBS anchor Jim Lehrer moderated the debate, seated at a table facing Bush and Kerry. \n",
      " The first debate took place in the hotly contested swing state of Florida, the site of the 2000 presidential recount, where Kerry plans to campaign through Saturday morning, with appearances scheduled in Tampa, Kissimmee and Orlando. Bush plans stops today in Pennsylvania, a battleground state he lost in 2000, and New Hampshire, which polls show is up for grabs despite being in Kerry's backyard. The president heads Saturday for Ohio, another important state leaning in his favor. \n"

      " In a report released Tuesday, the GAO said that the four independent counsels appointed to investigate the Clinton administration spent $8,747,706 from Oct. 1, 1996, to March 31, 1997. Counting GAO's latest figures, the probes have cost a total of $44,558,834 so far. \n",
      " Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr continued to be the biggest spender, beating independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz, who is investigating former agriculture secretary Mike Espy. \n",
      " Starr spent $3,332,463 for operating and investigatory costs during the six-month period, a drop in the pace he had kept since he was appointed in August 1994. Altogether, Starr has spent about $25.6 million to investigate the Whitewater real estate deal, the controversial firings of seven White House travel office employees and whether officials lied to the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee during hearings. \n",
      " Smaltz spent $3,185,926 during the six-month period. He has spent more than $11.8 million since he was appointed in September 1994. Espy was indicted here in August on 39 counts. \n",

      " \"We are moving ahead as quickly as we can, being consistent with fairness,\" said independent counsel David M. Barrett, who is investigating former housing secretary Henry Cisneros. Barrett spent $1,663,920 during the six-month period and has totaled more than $3.8 million since he was appointed in May 1995 to determine whether Cisneros lied to the FBI about payments that Cisneros made to a former mistress. \n",

      "U.S. and Japanese negotiators, extending talks beyond a midnight deadline, appeared headed toward a last-minute agreement Wednesday night on a new computer chip trade pact after the U.S. side presented a \"neutrally worded\" proposal that conceded ground on some of the main sticking points, according to people close to the negotiations. \n",
      " A separate dispute over deregulating Japan's insurance market appeared much less likely to be resolved, however, according to a senior U.S. official participating in the talks, which were held in Vancouver, B.C. \n",
      " Prospects for a chip pact brightened dramatically in the late afternoon Vancouver time, when the U.S. side, led by acting U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky, and top executives of the Semiconductor Industry Association submitted two documents, according to a Japanese industry source. That action, the source said, \"put us clearly within reach of an agreement.\" \n",
      " The deal could still fall apart over several important details that remain to be hammered out between the two industries, sources on both sides said, and a U.S. official cautioned that the final negotiations had been going \"like a roller-coaster,\" with the Japanese side sounding receptive to the U.S. proposal one minute and objecting the next. \n",
      " But a major step forward apparently occurred when Washington offered wording aimed at easing Tokyo's biggest concern. Japan was worried the pact would commit the Japanese government to maintaining or increasing the foreign share of Japan's chip market, with the risk of sanctions being imposed on Japanese products if the share fell too low. Currently, foreign firms -- mostly American -- hold about 30 percent of the $44 billion in chips sold annually to Japan's giant electronics, automotive and telecommunications industries. \n",
      " If something like the latest U.S. proposal is agreed upon, it will end a 10-year era during which the Japanese chip market operated under the government-endorsed \"expectation\" that the foreign share would reach 20 percent. \n",
      " That wording was incorporated in a controversial 1986 accord that was renewed for another five years in 1991. U.S. chip industry executives contend that the deal helped them crack Japan's tight-knit corporate networks and raise their share from 8 percent in the mid-1980s. \n",
      " But Japanese officials have long complained the accords represent a form of managed trade, and now that the foreign share far exceeds the 20 percent figure, Tokyo argues government should get out of the chip market altogether. Washington has declared its willingness to drop the numerical target in favor of vaguer language suggesting, for example, that \"further progress\" should be made in increasing foreign chip sales. The Japanese have rejected that wording as a thinly veiled target. \n",
      " Then late Wednesday, the U.S. side put forward language that was \"pretty vanilla,\" according to the Japanese industry source, who said the new wording \"in my judgment would not amount to an enforceable trade agreement. It doesn't use words like \"preserve' or \"enhance' or \"progress.' They've done a very good job of using neutral language.\" \n",
      " A U.S. official did not strongly dispute this characterization of the American proposal, but said: \"We have found other ways to address the principle of market access. That's the fundamental issue, the issue of concern to our industry, and there's more than one way to meet that objective.\" \n",
      " In insurance, Washington is demanding that Tokyo deregulate its market for life and casualty insurance, where Japanese firms have long dominated, before it deregulates the smaller markets in which U.S. firms are dominant, such as the market for malpractice insurance and cancer insurance. \n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: \n",
      " WASHINGTON -- There have always been beggars outside palaces, and comfortable people have always preserved their capacity for happiness by screening out other people's pain. But this self-protective instinct seems particularly powerful at the moment, as genocide unfolds slowly in Sudan's western province of Darfur. The world knows, and on Friday the United Nations Security Council acknowledged, that Sudan's government is responsible for burnings of villagers, systematic rapes and murder by starvation. It knows that these atrocities continue. And yet outsiders are content with measures that won't stop the appalling suffering. They issue statements but refuse to send adequate relief supplies. They condemn violence but refuse to send peacekeepers to protect civilians. \n",
      " How to explain this numbness? There are excuses for inaction -- or, more charitably, \"caution\" -- and they deserve to be confronted one by one. The first is that outsiders must respect Sudan's sovereignty, for sovereignty is the basis of orderly international relations. States threaten their neighbors only if they espouse aggressive foreign policies, this argument goes. What they do within their own borders is their own concern, and meddling establishes the dangerous principle that intervention is generally acceptable. As Henry Kissinger has argued in another context, the legal doctrine of national sovereignty and the principle of noninterference -- both enshrined in the U.N. Charter -- emerged at the end of the devastating Thirty Years War, the 17th-century conflict during which perhaps 40 percent of the population of Central Europe perished in the name of competing versions of universal truth. Humanitarian intervention leads to \"virtue run amok.\" \n",
      " This \"realism\" has always had a tenuous hold on American foreign policy for the good reason that this nation is founded upon universalist principles. But it seems particularly misplaced in the age of international terror, when respecting the sovereignty of failed states such as Afghanistan is not a viable option. The attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, demonstrated that what states do within their own borders can affect international security. Sovereignty is therefore a less useful principle than it once was, and Kofi Annan, the U.N. secretary general, has commissioned a study on ways of updating it. Refusing to save hundreds of thousands of people in Darfur out of defer- ence to an already tattered doctrine seems unwarranted. \n",
      " Then there is the argument that foreign policy must be conducted \"in the national interest,\" and that saving people in Darfur fails that test. There is an admirable democratic quality to this argument: The elites who run representative governments should make policy that reflects the outlook of the voters whom they represent. But do ordinary voters really oppose action? A recent PIPA-Knowledge Networks poll of 892 Americans found that, if the United Nations were to determine that genocide is occurring in Darfur, 57 percent would favor foreign intervention, including American intervention, while only 32 percent would be opposed. The nation's interests are in fact broader and more compassionate than the national-interest argument implies. \n",
      " Finally, there is the fear that foreign intervention in Sudan, especially one led or orchestrated by the United States, could trigger a popular backlash throughout the Muslim world. If this were correct, it would be extremely serious: The war against terrorism is a battle for Islamic hearts and minds. But the basis for this fear is shaky. It is true that Egypt's government opposes foreign intervention in its southern neighbor, not least out of a cynical belief that its own security and economic interests are served by an unstable Sudan. It is true, equally, that Sudan's Islamic government has greeted talk of Western intervention with a pledge to repel the \"crusaders.\" But the key to winning hearts and minds throughout the region is not to defer to the autocratic government of Egypt, still less to Sudan's rulers, whose victims in Darfur are after all Muslims. In contemplating intervention in Sudan, Arab opinion must be considered. But it's not clear that this means that intervention should be ruled out. \n"

      " Let's see. It was only a couple of weeks ago that the government was shut down because the president and the Republicans didn't have a deal on the budget, and then it was reopened because they did have one, only maybe they didn't, quite, and now, of course, they don't again, and maybe sometime this month those agencies that need a continuing resolution because they lack appropriations bills will have to be shut down a second time even though the appropriations bills aren't really the issue so much as the reconciliation bill. And, the Treasury secretary says if there's not a debt ceiling bill, we may all have coal in our stockings. \n",
      " Is there anyone in the public at large who can figure out what all these parts even are, let alone how they are related to one another? And, as if it weren't bad enough just in terms of grasping what is what, there is a hideously compounding problem: It's not just that there are a lot of bills in play and that the issues are confusing; it's that you have to sort out the talk and the truth, which is doubly hard. There are all kinds of public and private negotiations going on, not just between the parties but within them as the leaders try to appease competing factions and win over public opinion all at the same time. We hate to say it, but Rule One should probably be not to believe very much of anything you see or hear for a while. \n",
      " Herewith our effort to establish, as best we can, one of those \"You Are Here\" arrows that can be helpful when one is confronted with a road map or an architectural maze. There are three main parts to the mess. \n",
      " (1) First are the appropriations bills. There are supposed to be 13 of them every year. Some are for just one department, some for several, according to tradition; together they provide the operating funds for the entire government. Only half have so far been signed. The largest of the domestic appropriations bills covering most of the civilian agencies have not, and the president has threatened to veto most of them if they are sent to him in their present form. The agencies thus are operating under interim authority that expires Friday, Dec. 15. Absent an agreement by then, or by the following Monday, they'll have to shut down government again. \n",
      " (2) The government is also bumping up against the debt ceiling, the statutory limit on its borrowing authority. That too will have to be increased sooner or later or there will be a default; the government will lack the money to pay its bills, including debt as it comes due. The exact deadline is rubbery; it's a function in part of the ingenuity of the Treasury secretary. The debt ceiling is Part Two of the mix. \n",
      " (3) Part Three is the so-called reconciliation bill, the monster piece of legislation by which the Republicans would mainly balance the budget in seven years. It's the one that contains the tax cut and most of the big spending cuts they've been arguing about all year in Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, farm price supports and the rest. (These are the entitlement programs not subject to the appropriations process; the appropriations process covers defense and most of the smaller domestic programs.) \n",
      " The reconciliation bill is the one the Republicans most want to pass; it contains the bulk of their agenda. But it's different from the others in that the government can get along just fine without it. If it passes, you'll have, sooner or later, a very different kind of federal government. On the other hand, if it doesn't pass but the appropriations bills and a debt ceiling bill do, you'll have pretty much the same government as before. \n",
      " The administration would like to deal with the reconciliation problem separately. First put the normal fuel in the tank so there will be no crisis, not even a fake one; then figure out at leisure how you want the government to look for the longer term. The Republicans want to deal with the three big issues all at once. Their hope is to use the threat of shutting down the government to force the president to talk about the longer-term issues, which they fear he'll otherwise put off. \n"

They're jockeying. What you have to hope is that, beneath the jockeying, they're also having serious talks. But it will be a while before you have the answer to that one.

      "The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: \n",
      " Having decided to enlarge NATO, the West's diplomats are now discussing whom beyond the consensus three (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) should be invited in. \n",
      " Slovenia and Romania, the consensus fourth and fifth candidates, enjoy European but not so much American favor. It is a timely question, because NATO has committed itself to get out the invitations early in July, and all 16 members' parliaments are due to consider ratifying enlargement by 1999. \n",
      " The trouble is that while the West's specialists are seized by the issue, its publics are not. The threshold question of why expand at all needs much more explanation than Atlantic alliance leaders have given it until now. \n",
      " Why expand? Briefly, if the United States is to have any foreign policy at all, it must center on the strengthening and support of fellow democracies. Europe is where the most deeply rooted of them are. \n",
      " The particular post-Cold War challenge is to welcome back European states that have some history of democracy, and that spent much of the 20th century in involuntary servitude to Moscow. The expansion of NATO, along with the cultivation of the new Russia, is one fine way to bring them back. \n",
      " It means extra risk, because the old NATO members must be prepared to defend the new, including by going to war; it means extra cost. But both risk and cost seem bearable, if not downright cheap, measured against letting Europe's and Russia's insecurities run free. \n",
      " The broad thrust of alliance enlargement leaves open the specific issue of how best to proceed. To enroll no new members would be to inform a someday-revived Russia that central Europe may fall into its sphere. To welcome all possible applicants is to ensure undertaking more than NATO possibly could handle. Something in between is indicated. \n",
      " Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would lean toward admitting countries that have cleared \"the highest hurdles of reform\" and are prepared militarily. Poland, Hungary and the Czechs meet those terms. \n",
      " But Slovenia and Romania? They are an unmatched pair. Slovenia, formerly part of Yugoslavia, is democratic and market-oriented, but it would bring little to NATO's strategic resources -- although Slovenia would be far from NATO's smallest member: Luxembourg has only a fifth and Iceland a seventh of Slovenia's population. Romania would bring much in military and geopolitical capacity for stabilization duty in Europe's hottest corner, but it has a mixed record in reform. \n",
      " For both, the negatives seem more on American leaders' minds than on the minds of most NATO Europeans. The matter comes down to weighing the particulars of each nation against an overall sense of what is feasible and fair -- a sense that has not yet taken final form in American or alliance deliberations. \n",
      " However that comes out, it will be essential in making the first cut to anticipate the second in order not to convey that enlargement is a one-shot affair, as some fear and others hope it will be. A democracy's inconvenient location and complaining neighbors should not rule it out for all time. \n",
      " The sensitive countries here are the Baltics and Ukraine: They are perhaps not ready to be accepted now but surely do not deserve to be excluded permanently. Their NATO aspirations -- their aspirations for a place in the family of European democracies -- retain a deep claim on the policy of the West.: [2287, 2279, 2251]\n",

      "Increasing its pressure on Tokyo to settle an irritating trade dispute, the United States took steps Sunday to impose punitive measures if a 60-day negotiating period does not give U.S. companies a greater share of Japanese government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment. \n",
      " However, analysts said they did not think the United States really wants to impose such sanctions. \n",
      " U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced the measure after talks in Washington between U.S. and Japanese officials broke off Saturday, one day before a twice-postponed deadline to produce an agreement that would end what the United States says is Japan's \"persistent pattern of discrimination\" against U.S. manufacturers in the two lucrative sectors. \n",
      " In Tokyo markets, the dollar fell sharply Monday morning, opening at 98.45 yen, down 1.48 yen from Friday's close, but it recovered to 98.95 yen by midday. Stocks were mixed. \n",
      " Negotiations have been conducted, on and off, for nearly a year, since medical equipment and telecommunications gear were given a high priority. \n",
      " \"The time has come to use our trade laws ... if necessary to address the question of continued discrimination against U.S. companies,\" Kantor said in a statement. \n",
      " In Tokyo, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi said Japan is ready to resume trade framework talks with the United States but has no intention of continuing negotiations under U.S. sanctions pressure. \n",
      " Igarashi told a news conference, however, that both countries agree the two sides have the will to continue framework talks to seek a solution to their differences. \n",
      " \"Even if trade talks on government procurement were to be canceled, other sectors under the framework talks should be maintained,\" he said. \n",
      " U.S. and Japanese officials have said that the obstacle to reaching an agreement is determining acceptable \"qualitative and quantitative\" criteria for measuring the U.S. penetration of the Japanese market. \n",
      " The Japanese object to any effort to set specific goals, fearing they could become mandatory targets that, if not met, could lead to the imposition of sanctions in the form of U.S. tariffs on Japanese products sold in the United States or quotas limiting such sales. \n",
      " The United States insists that the two nations arrive at some system that will provide a clear measure of whether foreign companies are able to penetrate the Japanese market. \n",
      " The procedures announced Sunday provide that if an agreement is not reached within 60 days, the Clinton administration has the authority to raise tariffs on certain Japanese products shipped to the United States, a step that would probably lead to higher consumer prices for those items. \n",
      " While the threat of sanctions would suggest that the difficult U.S.-Japanese trade relationship is headed for new depths, neither side expressed great concern. \n",
      " Jeffrey Young, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. in Tokyo, said Japanese negotiators appear confident that Washington does not really want to impose sanctions. Some analysts in Tokyo, he noted, believe sanctions would hurt the United States more than Japan. \n",
      " (Optional Add End) \n",
      " U.S. officials cite what they say is a need to apply strong pressure on Japanese negotiators, and Japanese officials expressed the expectation that the talks would resume in September before any sanctions are imposed. \n",
      " Kantor's office said sales by foreign companies make up 25 percent of the average domestic private and public telecommunications market in the industrialized world but that the foreign share of this $10 billion market in Japan is 5 percent. \n",
      " U.S. manufacturers hold 40 percent of the medical technology market in the European Union, the trade office said, but their share in Japan is less than half that.: [2742, 2738, 2711]\n",

      "The standing-room-only crowd overflowing Trinity University's Laurie auditorium here Monday night was one of the biggest anyone could remember. The star attraction was Colin L. Powell, the big issue was whether he would run for president in 1996. \n",
      " And when a member of the audience put the question to him directly, Powell answered with Delphic aplomb: \"There is no real passion in me to run for office. But I don't want to rule it out.\" \n",
      " Given the 57-year-old retired Army general's utter lack of political experience and organized support, the likelihood of his becoming the 43rd president and the first African American to hold that office might seem slight right now. \n",
      " But Powell's elevated standing in public opinion surveys and the turbulent state of national politics make Washington insiders reluctant to discount such an outcome to next year's campaign. \n",
      " Intentionally or not, Powell himself has fueled the speculation --  tantalizing the political community as he did in his talk here by disclaiming interest in a political career on one hand and on the other refusing to flatly close the door. \n",
      " Last December, for example, after 1992 Democratic aspirant Paul E. Tsongas boosted Powell as a possible independent presidential candidate in 1996, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff called him to ask with mock indignation: \"What are you trying to do to my life?\" Yet Powell, who previously had sought and received a copy of Tsongas' memorandum making the case for a third party, notably did not ask Tsongas to stop using his name. \n",
      " By disdaining interviews while he labors on his memoirs (scheduled for publication in September), Powell has benefited from the contrast between his own reputation for restrained, responsible competence and the clamorous striving of most of the acknowledged aspirants for the presidency. \n",
      " But it is not just his eye-popping poll ratings that fuel the political pros' interest in a Powell candidacy for national office. Of more fundamental importance are two troublesome factors that now weigh heavily in the political mix: \n",
      " First, pervasive citizen discontent with the established political order has fostered enthusiasm for outsider Powell as what University of North Carolina historian William Leuchtenburg calls \"a purifying force.\" \n",
      " And Powell's rhetoric seems well suited to reinforce that notion. \"We need to stop shouting at one another,\" he exhorted his listeners at Trinity. \"We need to stop filling our homes with filth. We need to start having a sense of outrage at some of the things that are happening in our society that we take for granted.\" \n",
      " Second, frustration with the centuries-old American dilemma of race enhances Powell's appeal as a leader who could offer reassurance to whites and hope to blacks. \n",
      " Powell's career was aided by his two tours in Vietnam, where he earned the Purple Heart and later the Soldier's Medal when, after extricating himself from a helicopter crash, he limped back to the wreckage with a broken ankle to rescue his commanding general and three other men. \n",
      " Selected as a White House fellow in 1972, Powell caught the eye of Casper W. Weinberger, then President Nixon's budget director. That was the beginning of a series of promotions culminating in his appointment as national security adviser under President Ronald Reagan and chairman of the Joint Chiefs under President George Bush. \n",
      " The significance of this rise is of course closely intertwined with Powell's race. Many think that his ability would have earned him four stars regardless of his color. But because of his race, his rise took on extra meaning, not just for blacks but for white Americans too. \n",
      " Republicans, in particular, have looked at Powell's potential biracial appeal and dreamed of having him on their national ticket in 1996 as presidential nominee -- if the nominating convention should deadlock -- or, more plausibly, as vice president. \n",
      " Some GOP strategists calculated that putting Powell on the ticket as vice president would transform the election into a slam dunk for their party by assuring them of substantial inroads in the normally huge advantage Democrats enjoy among black voters. \n",
      " For all those reasons, a Powell candidacy has considerable appeal. But it also faces immense difficulties. \n",
      " Powell is a registered independent in his home state of Virginia, and even his closest friends swear that they do not know in which of the two major parties he would be most comfortable -- let alone how he views contentious issues. \n",
      " Then too, some question whether combat veteran Powell has a hide thick enough and reflexes quick enough to withstand the withering personal scrutiny common to presidential political battlefields. \n",
      " Many Powell admirers have thought in terms of a third-party or independent run. \n",
      " Powell seemed to lend a measure of credibility to that notion in a speech last November in Cleveland. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported that he said a third party in 1996 would be \"wonderful,\" adding: \"It would be terrific for the American people to have more choices.\" \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " Apart from his renown, Powell would bring considerable political gifts to such an endeavor, some honed during the course of his military career. \n",
      " His tour as national security adviser in the Reagan White House showed that Powell had a grasp of both the style and substance of diplomacy. \n",
      " As an orator, Powell lacks the dramatic flair of a George S. Patton or a Douglas MacArthur. But his direct, unaffected manner and self-deprecating humor captivate audiences on the lecture circuit, where Powell's trim, erect figure has been a frequent sight since his retirement as chairman of the Joint Chiefs in September, 1993. \n"

      "President Clinton's job approval has soared to the highest level of his presidency as strong public support for his policies and a distaste for his accusers appear to be outweighing doubts about his personal conduct, according to a new nationwide Los Angeles Times poll. \n",
      " Asked how Clinton is handling his job as president, 68 percent of those polled say they approve and only 29 percent disapprove. That rating is up about 10 percentage points from the level found by a Times poll last weekend, a few days after allegations first became public that Clinton had carried on an affair with a former White House staff member, Monica Lewinsky, and had urged her to lie about it. \n",
      " Even last week, Clinton's job approval rating had suffered only slightly from the scandal allegations. Clinton's high poll ratings have confounded his political adversaries and surprised many analysts, who believed he would suffer badly in public esteem because of the allegations. \n",
      " The fact that his approval has risen, instead, appears to be attributable to several factors: \n",
      " -- Clinton clearly received a boost from his State of the Union speech, which was heavily watched and overwhelmingly well-received. \n",
      " -- The public appears to be making a sharp distinction between his private behavior and his ability to conduct official business. \n",
      " -- When asked about his private behavior, the public views Clinton far more charitably than do his critics. \n",
      " -- And, finally, the public has a low opinion of Clinton's main accusers, particularly Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr. \n",
      " \"Clinton, in his State of the Union speech, appears to have done the right thing by not discussing the charges against him,\" said Times Poll Director Susan Pinkus. \"He appeared presidential and portrayed himself to the American people as in control and governing as normal.\" \n",
      " Americans remain sharply divided about whether they believe Clinton's denials that he had an affair, the poll shows. And the poll indicates that his standing could erode substantially if evidence ever proves that Clinton lied or urged others to lie. If serious wrongdoing were proven, majorities say they could support Clinton's impeachment or resignation. \n",
      " But respondents clearly do not want that to happen. By 56 percent-39 percent, those polled said that \"if the allegations prove true, I do not want Clinton's affair with Lewinsky or his efforts to deny it to force him out of office.\" \n",
      " At least some of Clinton's current high standing is likely to be the result of the \"bounce\" that presidents usually receive after major speeches -- a phenomenon that tends to dissipate over time. \n",
      " But even discounting the bounce, Clinton's approval is very high --  considerably higher than after previous State of the Union speeches and higher than the levels enjoyed by previous second-term presidents. Through most of his presidency, Clinton's approval had seldom topped 60 percent. \n",
      " The Times Poll was conducted Thursday through Saturday among 1,314 adults nationwide. The survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. \n",
      " In comparison with last week's survey, Clinton has gained substantial ground among younger Americans and political independents. In the current survey, those between the ages of 18 and 29 give him positive job ratings by a margin of 77 percent-21 percent, compared with 52 percent-44 percent a week ago. Independents give him a positive job approval, 70 percent-27 percent, compared with 56 percent-38 percent last week. \n",
      " The poll also indicates some overall improvement in Clinton's ratings among men. In past surveys, including last week's, women had tended to give Clinton a somewhat higher rating than men -- the much noted \"gender gap.\" In the current survey, Clinton's ratings are up among both men and women, with no statistically significant gender gap. \n",
      " Overall, the survey shows Clinton receiving very high ratings on his presidential responsibilities. \n",
      " Those polled say, by a margin of 53 percent-38 percent, that the country is on the right track and, by 86 percent-12 percent, that the economy is doing well. And the poll clearly indicates that Americans give Clinton credit for those good times. \n",
      " Asked if the country is better off or worse because of Clinton's tenure in office, over half said the country had benefited, while only one in ten said the country was worse off; and almost four in ten said Clinton had not made a difference one way or the other. \n",
      " Even among Republicans and conservatives, the percentage saying the country is better off because of Clinton outweighs the percentage who say the country has suffered. \n",
      " Looking to the future, each of the major proposals in Clinton's State of the Union speech gained approval by margins of well over 2-1. Three quarters of those who saw or heard the speech rated it excellent or good. \n",
      " That finding is no surprise, since Clinton's aides had done extensive polling about possible policy initiatives before putting them in the address. White House strategists have sought to shift attention away from Clinton's personal life and toward his policies. The poll shows the potential strength Clinton could gain from that approach. \n",
      " The public clearly makes a sharp distinction between the private and the public spheres. \n",
      " Asked if it is possible for Clinton to \"behave unethically in his personal life while still maintaining integrity in his presidential responsibilities,\" those surveyed said yes by a margin of 59 percent-35 percent. \n",
      " By 54 percent-38 percent those polled said Clinton has the \"honesty and intergrity to be president\" -- a level that is about average for his presidency. By 61 percent-38 percent they view him as credible. \n",
      " Byrum Cartwright, a 54-year-old dentist from Fargo, N.Dak., one of those surveyed, was typical of those who said they draw a distinction between private and public conduct. \n",
      " \"He probably is a guy who doesn't handle his sexual ethics the way we would like,\" Cartwright said. \n",
      " But Cartwright described himself as \"offended\" by the way Clinton's personal weaknesses are being used in \"political feuds.\" \n",
      " \"It's really irrelevant. It's between him and his wife,\" Cartwright said. \"If you want to have an ethically perfect person\" in office, he added, \"you're kidding yourself.\" \n",
      " Similarly, Lisa Burke, a 24-year-old self-described liberal Democrat from Colombus, Ga., said she is skeptical of Clinton's denials, but puts his performance on the job ahead of his private behavior. \n",
      " \"If he did it, that's his business,\" she said. \"As long as he does his job for the American people, that's what I'm concerned about.\" \n",
      " Even when asked about his private life, Americans are less censorious than are Clinton's critics. \n",
      " Asked if Clinton is \"fundamentally a decent person who has some character flaws\" or is \"amoral and fundamentally not a decent person,\" those surveyed choose the more positive portrayal, 70 percent-26 percent. This is so even though, by more than 2-1, those surveyed said that even before the new allegations they had thought Clinton had engaged in extramarital affairs. \n",
      " Indeed, 45 percent of those who voted for Clinton in both 1992 and 1996 said they thought he had had affairs even before the current allegations, compared with 28 percent who did not think so and 27 percent who said they were not sure. \n",
      " Clinton's personal favorability rating -- 57 percent favorable, 36 prcent unfavorable -- is lower than his job approval, but is still quite healthy -- 9 percentage points more positive than last week and about the same level as when he was reelected. \n",
      " His wife's favorability has moved sharply higher. By better than 2-1, those surveyed view Hillary Rodham Clinton favorably -- the most positive rating she has ever received in a Times poll. \n",
      " The shift in Mrs. Clinton's favorability seems in large part to come from moderate Republicans and Republican women. A majority of moderate Republicans now view her favorably, and Republican women, both moderates and conservatives, now divide evenly -- 45 percent favorable, 46 percent unfavorable. \n",
      " Clinton's chief accusers fare much worse. \n",
      " Only 32 percent of those polled say they approve of the way Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr is handling his job, while 37 percent disapprove and 31 percent are not sure. \n",
      " By 58 percent-32 percent, those polled say the allegations against Clinton \"have more to do with partisan politics (than) getting to the truth\" -- a view that is even shared by 44 percent of Republicans. \n",
      " By 51 percent-43 percent those surveyed say they agree with Mrs. Clinton that the allegations are \"part of a continuing right-wing conspiracy.\" \n"

      "A federal judge said Thursday that he would seize control of prison health care from the state and placeit under a receiver, declaring that \"extreme measures\" were needed to fix a system that kills one inmate each week through medical incompetence or neglect. \n",
      " U. S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said that despite repeated warnings from his court and the \"good intentions\" of some state officials, the Department of Corrections continues to allow sick prisoners to die \"for no acceptable reason.\" The judge said he would soon issue a written order outlining details of the receivership and begin discussing potential receivers with lawyers in the case. \n",
      " Attorneys on both sides called the decision historic, saying they believed it marked the first time in the nation that a government operation the size of California's prison medical care system had been placed under a federal receiver. \n",
      " In 1995, the District of Columbia's jails were assigned to a receiver for five years. That system has 1,700 inmates. The California Department of Corrections' health care network serves more than 163,000 prisoners, employs 6,000 workers and has an annual budget of $1.1 billion. \n",
      " Henderson, in a quietly passionate 25-minute speech from the bench, said \"horrifying details\" presented in a series of hearings he convened over the past month had filled him with a sense of urgency. He said he believed \"nothing short of a receiver\" could halt the deaths and other harm inflicted on California convicts who fall ill. \n",
      " The judge said he was especially alarmed by the \"uncontested statistic,\" provided by a court-appointed expert, \"that a prisoner needlessly dies an average of roughly once a week.\" \n",
      " By putting the system in receivership, Henderson effectively shifts power for all decisions related to inmate care -- from how many nurses should work a given shift to when a cancer patient receives treatment at a community hospital -- to the federal court. The receiver, who will report directly to the judge, will be empowered to order fixes now delayed or thwarted by civil service rules, collective bargaining agreements and bureaucratic red tape, lawyers said. \n",
      " Attorneys said they could not speculate how long the receivership might last or what it would cost. Henderson said it would certainly be a \"multiyear effort.\" \n",
      " Bruce Slavin, who as general counsel for the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency is the top lawyer for the state's $7-billion correctional system, said \"it will not be cheap.\" But he expressed hope that under a receiver, there would be better management of health care spending. \n",
      " Margita Thompson, spokeswoman for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, said the administration would cooperate with a receiver. \n",
      " \"We look forward to working with the receiver to create a sustainable health-care system,\" she said. \n",
      " Adult prisons are not the only piece of California's correctional system receiving outside oversight. The California Youth Authority, which houses about 3,000 of the state's most troubled juvenile offenders, is under the supervision of a special master, who monitors compliance with court-ordered improvements in inmate medical care, mental health care, education and other areas. \n",
      " State Sen. Gloria Romero, a Los Angeles Democrat and chairwoman of an oversight committee on corrections, attended the San Francisco hearing and applauded the judge's decision. \n",
      " \"This is the right thing to do, the only thing to do,\" Romero said. \"We invest $1.1 billion in this (health care) system every year and it's incredible to me that we don't get better results.\" \n",
      " An attorney for the inmate plaintiffs, who claimed in a 2001 class action lawsuit that prison health care amounted to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment, called Henderson's ruling \"everything we asked for\" and a beacon of hope for his clients. \n",
      " \"As the judge said the magnitude of the suffering could not be ignored,\" said Donald Specter, director of the Prison Law Office, a nonprofit firm taking the lead role in the case. \n",
      " Corrections officials did not oppose appointing a receiver, though they described it in legal briefs as \"a highly intrusive remedy\" that should be a last resort. Slavin said Thursday that the department had recently made progress in firing incompetent doctors, hiring nurses and addressing other woes. \n",
      " \"The question of fixing health care is not one of whether but when,\" he said. \"The administration has always been committed to getting it fixed. This [receivership] speeds it up.\" \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " Henderson's ruling was based on testimony from court-appointed experts who have been inspecting prison medical facilities as part of the lawsuit. The case was settled in 2002, when the state agreed to overhaul inmate health care and phase in improvements by 2008. \n",
      " Among the changes mandated by the settlement were the creation of a triage system to identify the sickest inmates and ensure they did not wait long to see a doctor, and a program allowing prisoners with chronic conditions to be more carefully monitored. \n",
      " The experts found few signs of progress and provided the court with chilling examples illustrating filthy conditions, ill-trained and neglectful doctors and a pattern of preventable deaths that one expert called \"macabre\" and unlike anything he had ever seen before. \n",
      " The expert, correctional health-care authority Dr. Michael Puisis, said medical treatment amounted to \"almost anarchy\" at some prisons, where disorganized or missing patient records mean that \"medical providers are reduced to guessing or repeating tests and treatment already done.\" \n",
      " Puisis, editor of a textbook on medical care in prisons, said inmates needing diagnostic tests faced extreme delays that imperiled their lives. Such delays could be caused by transportation snafus, scheduling errors, prison emergencies and a host of other circumstances. \n",
      " In one instance, a patient at Pleasant Valley State Prison near Bakersfield who needed a colonoscopy waited nearly a year and then could not undergo the test because his \"mass was so large, the scope could not be passed through,\" according to a written summary of Puisis' testimony.: [3291, 3270, 3183]\n",

It is about killing,\" ABC News \"Nightline\" Executive Producer Leroy Sievers said in an unusual message to the program's e-mail subscribers discussing the issues posed by Wednesday's killings. \"If we try to avoid showing pictures of bodies, if we make it too clean, then maybe we make it too easy to go to war again.\" \n",
      " On \"Nightline,\" images were shown of the bodies hanging from the bridge, but several other, even more graphic close-up images were omitted. \n",
      " The video from Fallouja on Wednesday was so graphic, so horrific, that U.S. television networks held back showing it, wrestling through the day with just how much to use on their news programs. \n",
      " Some TV and newspaper websites, including that of the Los Angeles Times, offered video from The Associated Press of the grisly killings of four American contractors in Iraq, but warned visitors that it contained \"graphic, violent images.\" \n",
      " The events Wednesday -- and the responses they provoked -- were bluntly reminiscent of the downing of a Black Hawk helicopter in Somalia in 1993, followed by upsetting images of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, the capital. \n",
      " That incident eventually led to a change in U.S. policy. It was not clear Wednesday whether the graphic video of the deaths of American civilians would alter public opinion or the prosecution of the war in Iraq. But that possibility confronted policymakers and news executives across the country. \n",
      " White House press secretary Scott McClellan said that with such attacks, \"the enemies of freedom, the enemies of the Iraqi people, are trying to shake our will, but they cannot. We will not be intimidated.\" \n",
      " But recognizing the effect that such images have had in the past, he urged caution and told reporters: \"I hope everybody acts responsibly in their coverage.\" \n",
      " The decisions could have a political impact. While showing the images could erode support for the war, not showing them could have an opposite impact. \n",
      " Acting \"responsibly\" and not showing troubling scenes, some observers said, could have the effect of helping the White House maintain public confidence for the war effort. \n",
      " Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Washington-based Project for Excellence in Journalism, said that networks' \"sanitization of war may have helped the administration prosecute the war\" a year ago. During the height of the war, few pictures of slain American soldiers were shown and news photographers were not allowed at places where they could shoot images of coffins being shipped back to the United States. \n",
      " The pictures from Wednesday's attack, Rosenstiel said, could anger viewers, or \"engender disenchantment about the war.\" \n",
      " The administration should be acutely concerned about the impact of images of atrocity against Americans, said Gordon Adams, director of security policy studies at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University and a former Clinton administration official. \n",
      " \"Pictures like this are megaphones,\" Adams said. \"They are megaphones about being an American and being in Iraq. The security situation in Iraq has not been solved. The policy has ended up making targets of Americans, and this brings that home.\" \n",
      " Mark Gearan, the director of communications in the Clinton White House at the time of the Black Hawk helicopter tragedy, recalled Wednesday how the episode forced a change in policy. \n",
      " \"It was among the darkest days that the president had, because of the sense of responsibility of having involved U.S. forces and the horror of what happened,\" said Gearan, president of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y. \n",
      " Soon afterward, the United States abandoned its military mission there. \n",
      " During the Vietnam War, Associated Press photographs of a Viet Cong guerrilla being executed on a Saigon street and of a naked girl burned by napalm became two of the lasting images of that war. \n",
      " But with a generation of experience, news executives Wednesday found the decision-making no easier. \n",
      " Los Angeles Times Editor John S. Carroll said that after considerable debate, \"we decided not to use one of the grotesque photographs on Page 1. Instead, we chose to convey the nature of the event by means of headlines and a photo that is not so distressing. \n",
      " \"We also decided to run one of the many photos of the bodies inside the paper,\" he said. This, Carroll added, gave readers a choice about how graphic a portrayal they would see. \n",
      " Initially, several networks decided, in the words of a Fox News Channel spokesman, that the video was \"too graphic to show on television.\" But as the day wore on, some began using some of the more graphic images, even showing the blackened, barely recognizable bodies hanging from the bridge. \n",
      " \"It's impossible to tell the story without using some of the footage, but we will use it judiciously,\" said Jim Murphy, executive producer of \"CBS Evening News.\" \n",
      " But Murphy said some of the video was \"unbelievably gruesome,\" and added: \"I don't see what purpose there is to showing that.\" \n",
      " CBS was sent reeling earlier this year by a public uproar over its Superbowl halftime broadcast, in which pop star Janet Jackson bared a breast. \n",
      " On Wednesday, the network's news program electronically blurred some of the most gruesome images from Fallouja and a reporter said in a voice-over that the images were \"so horrid, we chose not to show you\" the worst of them. \n",
      " ABC also electronically blurred images of bodies in its evening news broadcast. A spokesman said the network reviewed the video \"frame by frame to decide what can be used.\" \n",
      " At NBC, TV news executives said they tried to balance the obligation to present the news with the need to \"be sensitive to our viewers.\" \n",
      " \"My feeling is we can convey the horrors of this despicable act without showing overly graphic footage,\" said Steve Capus, executive producer of \"NBC Nightly News.\" \"CNN began airing increasingly graphic footage as the day wore on and as the story became more familiar to Americans who had had a chance to view the video online. A spokeswoman said the network delayed airing more graphic images earlier in the day to \"give the U.S. authorities time to contact the next of kin.\" \n",
      " Whether news executives made the proper decisions may take years of perspective to determine. But the real effect of the images on Americans could be felt just months from now. \n",
      " \"These are the kinds of pictures that will linger,\" said John Schulz, dean of Boston University's College of Communications and a former faculty member at the National War College. \"They'll be there in November when people go to vote.\" \n"

      "The following editorial appeared in Monday's Washington Post: \n",
      " In appealing to the Supreme Court to save the D.C. handgun ban, local officials rightly thought of what was best for the people of Washington, D.C. A lower court had already invalidated the ban, and there was a chance -- albeit limited -- of prevailing. Instead, the high court agreed that the ban is unconstitutional. Officials again must think of those citizens in fashioning the strongest legal protections against gun violence. \n",
      " Even before the court issued its historic -- and misguided -- 5 to 4 ruling Thursday, law enforcement officials for Mayor Adrian M. Fenty, D, were working on a worst-case assumption. A task force was formed in the attorney general's office to study the issue and to formulate new rules. Because the court's decision doesn't take effect immediately, the city has some breathing space in devising regulations that can provide for rational management of gun ownership and, equally important, withstand legal challenge. Gun rights activists say they will be closely watching to make sure the District of Columbia doesn't thwart the court's intent by a layering of what they would see as onerous restrictions. The possibility of further litigation must not deter the mayor and the D.C. Council from coming up with sensible protections for a city where far too many people are killed and otherwise victimized by guns. \n",
      " The city's job was made more difficult by the court's failure to provide any real clues as to what are permissible government restrictions on gun owners. As The Post's Robert Barnes observed, the court raised as many questions as it answered in terms of what can be outlawed. Working in the District's favor, though, are strong laws on the books that were seemingly untouched by the court's ruling. For example, the District's system of gun registration, which predates the 1976 ban on handguns, is among the strictest in the nation. Not only does it set requirements for who can own a gun, it also requires being fingerprinted, passing tests and completing an application certified by police. Council member Phil Mendelson, D-At Large, whose public safety committee will hold a hearing Wednesday on the decision, rightly wonders whether ballistics tests or a reasonable waiting period might also be appropriate. \n",
      " As city officials seek the right balance in meeting the court's order, they shouldn't also have to worry about congressional interference. Legislation already was pending on Capitol Hill to restrict the city's ability to regulate firearms, and the court's action could fuel that sorry effort. It's incumbent on leaders from both parties not to allow such interference in local democracy.: [3035, 3003, 2968]\n",

      "Defense Secretary William J. Perry Wednesday pledged U.S. efforts to reduce the \"intrusiveness\" of American military bases in Japan's southern island of Okinawa, but bluntly warned that the U.S.-Japan alliance is not without cost. \n",
      " Seeking to calm a nationwide uproar sparked by the rape of a 12-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl, allegedly by three U.S. servicemen, Perry told a news conference that on behalf of the entire U.S. military, he wanted to express \"deep sorrow\" for the victim and \"anger\" at the perpetrators. \n",
      " In morning meetings with Foreign Minister Yohei Kono and Defense Agency Director Gen. Seishiro Eto, Perry reached agreement on establishment of a \"special action committee\" to explore and implement ways to scale back the activities of U.S. bases on Okinawa. But the two sides agreed that total U.S. troop strength in Japan will remain at 47,000, Perry said. \n",
      " At his news conference, Perry offered a vigorous defense of the continuing importance of the U.S.-Japan security relationship in the post-Cold War era. \n",
      " During times of peace, Perry said, it is easy to focus on the inconveniences caused by the bases. But if U.S. armed forces here ever must be used in combat, he told his mostly Japanese audience, \"I will be very glad, and you will be very glad, that they are based where they are.\" \n",
      " \"They are located here because this is where they have to be to provide the security umbrella for the Asia-Pacific region,\" Perry said. \"Freedom is never free. Security is never guaranteed. You have to work for it. You have to work for it.\" \n",
      " The two sides also reached agreement on the broad outlines of a joint statement reaffirming the U.S.-Japan security alliance to be adopted by President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama at a Nov. 20 Tokyo summit, Perry said. \n",
      " In the statement the two nations will declare that \"our security relationship is absolutely essential to the security and stability of the region,\" Perry said. The United States will reaffirm its guarantee of Japan's security, and Japan will reaffirm its commitment to support America's forward presence in Asia, he said. \n",
      " While the total number of U.S. troops in Japan must not be cut, it might be possible to move some of the 26,000 American troops in Okinawa to other bases in Japan, Perry said. Many Okinawans have long considered it unfair that they are forced to give up 20 percent of their main island to play host to 75 percent of the U.S. military facilities in Japan, despite their having less than 1 percent of Japan's land. Partly because Okinawans have historically been treated as second-class citizens by many Japanese, resentment over the base arrangements has often been targeted against Tokyo as much as against Washington. \n",
      " \"People say that the Japan-U.S. security arrangement is important, but no one offers to accept its burdens,\" Okinawa Gov. Masahide Ota complained Monday to a visiting delegation of politicians from Japan's ruling coalition. \"If it is so important, why doesn't the whole nation shoulder the burdens?\" \n",
      " While the rape incident triggered the recent round of anti-base protests, what really forced Tokyo and Washington to take Okinawans' protests seriously was that Ota refused to use his legal power to force anti-base landowners to renew leases on parcels used for U.S. military facilities. \n",
      " Ota's anti-base stance has reflected strong feelings on Okinawa that have deep historical roots. \n",
      " An independent kingdom until the 19th century, Okinawa was the scene of the bloodiest battle of World War II. More than 230,000 people, including about 14,000 Americans and 120,000 civilians, or one-third of Okinawa's population at the time, died in that brutal 83-day struggle. Anti-war sentiment has been strong on the island since. \n",
      " \"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, and therefore I want to ask for a reduction of bases in a form visible to the eyes of the people of Okinawa,\" Ota told the ruling parties' delegation. \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " While Ota reiterated Monday that he will not sign the leases, Okinawa Vice Gov. Masanori Yoshimoto issued a pointed reminder that Prime Minister Murayama also has the power to take this unpopular step. \n",
      " A Japanese government plan for consolidation of U.S. bases on Okinawa, like Perry's three-day mission to Japan, appears aimed in part at easing Ota's and other Okinawans' objections if Muraya ma uses his legal authority to force renewal of the leases. \n",
      " The plan calls for faster implementation of measures already agreed to between Tokyo and Washington for consolidation of some bases and return of some base land to civilian use, according to Japanese media reports. It also urges the two countries to reach agreement on scaling down other facilities. \n",
      " Perry stressed that the two sides have made major progress since 1991 on 23 proposals to reduce the impact of U.S. bases on Okinawan life, including trimming the size of some bases and new ways of con ducting exercises. But the entire issue cannot be settled during his brief stay, he said.: [2520, 2518, 2498]\n",

      "Acting on a tip, heavily armed police raided a Brooklyn apartment Thursday and found five bombs that prosecutors charged were destined for a terrorist attack on New York's subway system. \n",
      " Police entering the apartment shot and wounded two suspects. The officers said they fired to prevent the suspects from detonating one of the devices. A third man, reportedly the informant in the case, also was taken away by police. \n",
      " \"It appears as if they succeeded in at least activating one switch,\" New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said, describing the close call. \n",
      " A federal law enforcement official in Washington said \"given the makeup of the bomb\" a suicide bombing is \"a strong theory\" in the investigation. \n",
      " The mayor said at least one of the three suspects indicated he was pleased by the suicide bombings of a crowded Jerusalem marketplace Wednesday in which 15 people were killed. \n",
      " Giuliani said the man was \"expressing support for what happened in Israel and was gratified that it occurred.\" \n",
      " The mayor, a former federal prosecutor, stressed, however, that no direct link had yet emerged between the apartment raid and the marketplace explosion for which the militant Islamic group Hamas has claimed responsibility. \n",
      " Late Thursday, the two wounded defendants, Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer and Lafi Khalil were arraigned in absentia in federal court in Brooklyn as they recuperated at a Brooklyn hospital, where they were listed in stable condition after surgery. \n",
      " In accompanying documents the government said Abu Mezer told federal agents that the bombs were targeted for detonation on the subway. The papers added that an address book he possessed contained the name of a member of a known terrorist organization. Neither the member's name nor the organization was disclosed. \n",
      " The court papers also described the police raid, which was mounted after authorities received a tip late Wednesday night that the second-floor apartment in the Park Slppe neighborhood was a bomb factory. \n",
      " Police surrounded the site, secured several city blocks and quietly removed 90 residents of nearby buildings. \n",
      " Then at 4:30 a.m. Thursday, an eight-man team entered the apartment. \n",
      " \"The apartment was completely dark with the exception of police flashlights,\" the federal complaint said. \"The police announced themselves and repeatedly ordered the defendants not to move. Both defendants disobeyed the orders and moved toward the officers.\" \n",
      " \"One defendant attempted to grab an officer's weapon. The second defendant moved toward a black bag which later was found to contain an explosive device,\" the complaint added. \n",
      " Subway service in the neighborhood was halted, inconveniencing 300,000 riders as members of the bomb squad gingerly inspected the explosives, which were later taken by disposal truck to the police range at Rodnam's Neck in the Bronx. \n",
      " Before undergoing his operation, prosecutors said that Abu Mezer told agents how to safely disarm or detonate the bombs. \n",
      " Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the bombs were capable of killing a person in a confined area up to 25 feet and would cause injuries up to 100 feet in an outside area. \n",
      " \"We do not know at this time, and it will take a lot further analysis to determine whether these were intended to be separate devices or one device,\" Safir said. \n",
      " Prosecutors said they found a Jordanian passport in Abu Mezer's bag, but were unsure if it was legitimate. Also in the bag were Canadian and U.S. immigration documents and a completed application for asylum in the United States. \n",
      " Court papers said the asylum application indicated the defendant was previously arrested in Israel and accused of being a member of a known terrorist organization. \n",
      " Attorney General Janet Reno said the joint FBI/New York police terrorist task force was conducting the investigation, and White House press secretary Mike McCurry said President Clinton complimented the police for \"fine law enforcement work.\" \n",
      " James K. Kallstrom, deputy director of the FBI in charge of the bureau's New York field office, said \"we're finding our scope is global.\" \n",
      " Detectives and FBI agents were seeking to determine whether the three men had links to Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, currently on trial in federal court in Manhattan on charges he acted as the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing in February 1993 that killed six people and injured more than 1,000. \n",
      " In a separate case last year, Yousef was convicted of plotting to blow up a dozen U.S. jetliners during 48 hours of unprecedented terror over the Pacific Ocean. \n",
      " Members of the terrorist task force also were looking into the possibility the three suspects were followers of militant Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman who was found guilty of plotting a war of urban terrorism against the United States by planning to blow up two tunnels, the United Nations and the building housing the FBI's field office in Manhattan. \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " The Washington Post reported that the Arabic-speaking man who alerted police to the alleged bombing plot was tentatively identified late Thursday as Mohamed Shindli, of Pakistan. Government officials said he approached two Long Island Rail Road police officers about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday. The officers, unable to understand Shindli, took him to the New York Police Department's 88th Precinct station house, where detectives summoned the FBI translator. \n",
      " After he described the bombs, the other men in the apartment and the layout of the residence, Shindli was allowed to return to the apartment, government officials said. He was asleep in an outer room when the NYPD emergency services team arrived. The two other men and the bombs were found in an inner room. \n",
      " During the day, dozens of police and FBI agents combed through the building in Brooklyn's Park Slope, a neighborhood of brownstones and small shops. \n",
      " An FBI crime lab in a trailer was parked in front of the building, which also contained a car service. \n",
      " Santiago Velazquez, one of the drivers for the car service, said there was heavy traffic in and out of the building, and many of the people arrived in yellow cabs and carried bags, boxes and suitcases with baggage tags indicating they had just come from the airport. \n",

      "Some grimaced, others squirmed uncomfortably in their seats. But everyone was listening as Miles Edwards, a retired lung specialist, began talking in clinical detail about what happens to people who take their lives by ingesting large numbers of barbiturate pills. \n",
      " \"The taste is terrible, and anti-nausea medications don't work. The vomit goes halfway up the esophagus and down the windpipe, and the lung damage is terrible,\" Edwards said in a clipped voice. \"I've seen patients with dreadful, horribly undignified deaths.\" \n",
      " As Oregonians are being asked to vote once again on the emotionally wrenching question of whether to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, the debate has shifted from the issue of morality and ethics to a starkly clinical -- almost macabre --  examination of what happens when someone commits suicide by lethal overdose. \n",
      " Casting their ballots in a mail referendum that began Oct. 15 and will end Tuesday, voters are being bombarded in meetings and over the airwaves not so much with arguments about the divine nature of life, as occurred during a 1994 referendum on the issue, but with hard-edged depictions of the agonies that occur on the way to suicide and the brain damage that botched efforts can cause. \n",
      " In 1994, voters narrowly endorsed doctor-assisted suicide, but the shift in emphasis this time around has had a dramatic effect, all but eliminating the 2 to 1 advantage supporters of legalization enjoyed less than two months ago, according to independent pollster Tim Hibbitts, who conducted the only statewide nonpartisan poll on the issue. \n",
      " If the measure to repeal the 1994 referendum fails -- and there are no further court-ordered delays -- the Oregon Health Division will be required to issue its regulations governing physician-assisted suicide along the lines of the 1994 referendum. Doctors would then be free to prescribe lethal doses of medications to terminally ill patients who want to end their lives. \n",
      " Hibbitts said that while the concept of physician-assisted suicide probably is still supported by a large majority of Oregon voters, opponents clearly have undermined confidence in the law by \"throwing the rhetorical equivalent of red meat at them\" for shock value. \n",
      " The debate is important not only here but in about 20 states that are considering right-to-die laws and are watching to see how the battle plays out in Oregon. \n",
      " -(optional trim begins here)-  \n",
      " The 1994 referendum made Oregon the first state to allow doctors to help terminally ill patients die by prescribing self-administered lethal overdoses of medications such as barbiturates. The initiative was passed by 51 percent of the voters at least partly because it explicitly precludes a physician from ending a patient's life by lethal injection, thereby removing the taint of mercy killing or euthanasia that helped defeat broader initiatives in Washington state in 1991 and California in 1992. \n",
      " Shortly after its approval by the voters, the Oregon law, called Measure 16, was barred from taking effect by a federal judge. But in February of this year, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed that injunction, ruling that the law's opponents were in no personal danger of injury and, therefore, lacked legal \"standing\" to file a lawsuit. The law was not implemented as opponents took their case to the Supreme Court. \n",
      " On Oct. 14, the Supreme Court, which in an earlier case had ruled that the Constitution does not give individuals a \"right to die\" with medical help, nonetheless dismissed the final appeals of the law's opponents. The high court said, in effect, that this difficult issue should be resolved by the states and their voters -- not by federal judges. \n",
      " As Measure 16 was working its way through the courts, Oregon's Republican-controlled state legislature, citing what it said was newly discovered scientific data on the unreliability of lethal overdoses of drugs, put the issue back on the ballot to remedy what it called Measure 16's \"defective\" provisions. In fact, the new initiative now on the ballot, called Measure 51, proposes repealing Measure 16 outright. \n",
      " The legislature's action caused an uproar here, because it was the first time in more than 90 years that the legislature has sent an approved referendum back to the people. \n",

      "Michael Kennedy, the 39-year-old son of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was killed Wednesday afternoon in a skiing accident at the posh Colorado ski resort of Aspen. \n",
      " He was the second of Robert and Ethel Kennedy's 11 children to die tragically. His brother David died 13 years ago of a drug overdose, and other family members have been victims of what some have called a family curse. \n",
      " Kennedy, whose alleged affair with a family babysitter tarnished the family political legend and may have prevented his brother from running for governor in 1998, died after colliding with a tree on an intermediate slope, according to a statement released by the Aspen Ski Co. \n",
      " \"Ethel Kennedy and her family are mourning the loss of their beloved son Michael, who was fatally injured while skiing with his family in Aspen,\" said a statement released by the resort, located in the central Colorado Rockies 162 miles southwest of Denver. \"He was a special and wonderful father, son, brother, cousin and friend, and his family would appreciate your prayers during this tragic time.\" \n",
      " Details of the accident that claimed Kennedy's life were sketchy Wednesday night. Aspen authorities would only say that he struck a tree about 4:15 p.m. while skiing down the Copper Bowl ski run with several members of his family and was treated at the scene within four minutes by the resort's ski patrol. \n",
      " \"The ski patrol provided extensive first aid on the scene and transported Mr. Kennedy to an ambulance at the base of Aspen Mountain,\" the resort said in a prepared statement Wednesday night. \"On-mountain treatment included intensive cardiac care, spinal immobilization, and respiratory support.\" \n",
      " Kennedy was transported to Aspen Valley Hospital 1Â½ miles away, where he arrived at 4:51 p.m. and was pronounced dead an hour later, authorities said. \n",
      " The ski run where Kennedy was skiing begins near the 11,212-foot summit of Aspen Mountain and is rated as an intermediate run. Weather conditions were clear and mild, and the resort said it had about a 25-inch base of packed powder snow at the time of the accident. \n",
      " There were unconfirmed reports that Kennedy and the people he was skiing with were tossing a football back and forth as they descended the slope. \n",
      " Kennedy's death \"appears to be accidental,\" said the Pitkin County sheriff's office in a statement released Wednesday night. \n",
      " Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II, D-Mass., whose plans to run for governor of Massachusetts were stymied by the publicity of his brother's alleged affair with the family babysitter, released a statement that read: \"Michael's death is a terrible tragedy for his children, his wife, Vicki, and his entire family. We will miss him dearly.\" \n",
      " Michael Kennedy's uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said in a statement: \"Vicki and I are heartbroken over Michael's tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ethel, his children, Michael Jr., Kyle and Rory, and their mother, Vicki. We loved him and we will miss him very much.\" \n",
      " Michael Kennedy, the sixth child born to the younger brother of the late President John F. Kennedy, headed a non-profit organization that provides heating fuel to the poor. He also headed the Senate re-election campaign effort of his uncle in 1994, and was regarded as a likely candidate for Congress from Massachusetts. \n",
      " But the sensational allegations of a longstanding affair with a babysitter -- beginning when the girl was 14 years old -- ended all that and provided grist for the Boston newspapers and national tabloids. \n",
      " The Boston Globe, for example, reported that the alleged affair prompted marital problems between Michael and his wife Victoria Kennedy, the daughter of ABC sports commentator Frank Gifford. In 1995, sources told the Globe, Victoria discovered Michael and the girl in bed. The newspaper also reported that the long-running affair was one reason the couple announced in April that they had separated after 16 years of marriage. They had three children. \n",
      " In July, Norfolk County, Mass., District Attorney Jeffrey A. Locke announced that he had called off his investigation into charges that Kennedy had committed statutory rape, citing the babysitter's refusal to cooperate. \n",
      " Responding in a statement, Michael Kennedy said: \"I deeply apologize for the pain I have caused. I intend to do all I can to make up for the serious mistakes I have made, and to continue to obtain the help I need.\" He said earlier this year he was undergoing treatment for alcoholism. \n",
      " His death on the ski slope unavoidably evoked a legacy of tragedy that has haunted the Kennedy family for decades, throughout its long and dramatic run on the American political stage. \n",
      " For every Kennedy triumph, it seems, there has been an attendant death or disaster. First there was the death in 1944 of Joseph P. Kennedy Jr., the dashing oldest son of Joseph and Rose Kennedy, and thought to be the family's first political star. He was killed in a World War II aerial crash over the English Channel. Kathleen Kennedy, the oldest sister, died three years later, also in an air crash, followed two decades later by the assassinations of President Kennedy in 1963 and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. \n",
      " The younger generation has been unable to escape tragedy as well. Michael's brother, David, died of a drug overdose in Palm Beach, Fla., in 1984. Their cousin, Edward, the son of Edward M. Kennedy, lost a leg to cancer. Another cousin, William Kennedy Smith, was acquitted of a rape charge in Palm Beach in 1991, but the intense media coverage was withering and may have played a role in the babysitter's refusal to press charges against Smith's cousin Michael. \n"

      "Three years ago, Ronald H. Brown, then chair of the Democratic National Committee, blasted the Bush administration for a critical decision over population counts. \n",
      " The point of contention was which set of population figures to use in congressional reapportionment and federal funding allocations: the original results of the 1990 census head count; or a second set of population figures that had been statistically weighted to compensate for the 4 million Americans known to have been missed -- or undercounted -- in the census. \n",
      " If the argument involved mind-numbing statistical complexities, it also carried crystal-clear political ramifications. The states and cities with lower population counts would lose out on both representation in Congress and federal funding. Then-Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher chose to use the original Census figures. \n",
      " Brown responded in a statement that \"After being presented with undisputable evidence of an overwhelmingly high undercount, Secretary Mosbacher's decision not to adjust can only be a political, partisan and Republican-party serving one.\" \n",
      " Now, Brown is commerce secretary and, because of a federal appeals court ruling earlier this month, he must make roughly the same choice that faced Mosbacher in 1991. The Clinton administration within the coming weeks must decide whether to defend Mosbacher's decision in an ongoing lawsuit or agree to settle with New York City, Washington and two dozen other communities and groups that had fought for use of the \"adjusted\" numbers. \n",
      " That pending choice places Brown and the Clinton administration in a politically difficult position, sure to prompt criticism from communities and states that lose out as a result of the decision. \n",
      " \"It's very touchy,\" said Dick Munson, director of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition, made up of federal lawmakers from states in the region. \"There's going to be opposition no matter which way they go on this because it involves political power and money.\" \n",
      " Brown, who is in China, could not be reached for comment. Others closely involved in the issue say the administration has given no indication of how it may act. \n",
      " The dispute dates from 1988, when New York City filed suit against the federal government to force it to use adjusted numbers for the 1990 census. New York officials knew their population count would be higher using the weighted figures because minorities and big-city residents, many of whom are poor and move frequently, are most likely to be missed in the census. \n",
      " In 1991, Mosbacher did not order an adjustment, arguing that the statistically weighted numbers -- based on a survey conducted after the actual head count -- were not accurate enough for small geographic areas. \n",
      " Mosbacher's decision was upheld by U.S. District Judge Joseph M. McLaughlin in 1993. But early this month, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, in a 2 to 1 decision, vacated the lower court decision and remanded it to McLaughlin. \n",
      " \"Given the concededly greater accuracy of the adjusted count,\" wrote Judge Amalya L. Kearse for the majority, \"the Secretary's decision was not entitled to be upheld without a showing by the Secretary that the refusal to adjust the census was essential to the achievement of a legitimate governmental objective.\" \n",
      " Now the Clinton administration must opt either to continue defending Mosbacher's decision by taking it to the Supreme Court, argue the position before McLaughlin or reach a settlement with the plaintiffs that would effectively end the lawsuit. \n",
      " Those involved say it is unlikely that either side would fight hard for a mid-decade reapportionment or widespread redistricting, given the political confusion that would entail. \n",
      " \"That's total chaos. Just imagine what would happen in the middle of the decade,\" said Munson, whose organization has been active on this issue. \n",
      " More likely is an agreement to use the adjusted figures in the 2000 census or for some limited purposes -- such as funding or redrawing boundaries where there is a dispute -- in the interim. \n",
      " But it is clear that, whatever the decision, it will ignite protest from the members of Congress, governors and other political leaders in losing jurisdictions. A decision to adjust, for example, could win favor from large urban areas and Sun Belt states, but it could alienate those in the Midwest and Northeast. \n",
      " If the adjusted numbers had been used to reapportion Congress after the 1990 census, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania would have lost one House seat, whereas California and Arizona would have gained one each. \n",
      " Some have argued that, now in office, the Clinton administration may view the issue differently from the way the Democratic Party did in 1991. But others point out that, given Brown's statements then and Clinton's campaign rhetoric, it would be inconsistent now to defend the Bush administration decision. \n",
      " \"Mosbacher's decision is anathema to everything President Clinton campaigned for and which he has articulated throughout his presidency,\" said Peter L. Zimroth, a partner at Arnold Porter and one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs. \"Mosbacher's decision is the politics of exclusion par excellence.\": [2675, 2671, 2641]\n",

      "Ukraine rejected Russia's last-minute offer to briefly delay a crippling increase in natural gas prices late Saturday, raising the possibility that Moscow could turn off the taps as early as Sunday. \n",
      " With both sides hovering near a compromise for much of the week, it was unclear whether Russia would follow through with its threat to stop the flow of the heating fuel in the depths of winter, or would make good on President Vladimir V. Putin's offer earlier in the day to hold off on a price increase until April. \n",
      " Ukraine has reportedly refused to agree to Russia's demand that it pay \"market prices\" for natural gas after that date. \n",
      " In Ukraine, which depends on Russia for about 40 percent of its gas, demands for a rate hike are widely seen as a response to the \"Orange Revolution.\" The largely peaceful uprising a little more than a year ago toppled Ukraine's pro-Russian government and helped elect President Viktor Yushchenko, whose leanings are toward the market economics of the West. \n",
      " \"Russia's firm position that Ukraine should buy gas at European prices is certainly a reaction to the new political course Ukraine is pursuing now,\" Socialist Party parliament deputy Mikola Rudkovsky said in a telephone interview from Kiev, the Ukrainian capital. \n",
      " The dispute could have a ripple effect through Europe, which depends on Ukrainian pipelines for transit shipment of about 30 percent of its natural gas. Russia has said the flow to Europe would not be interrupted even if Ukraine's supply is cut off. \n",
      " Early Sunday, officials at Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled energy giant, signaled a hard line, announcing that Ukraine had declined Russia's offer to postpone the dispute and said its threat to cut off supplies at 10 a.m. New Year's Day remained in effect. \n",
      " But Putin had been more conciliatory Saturday. \"Ukraine is not an abstract bunch of senior officials, and not a lot of oil and gas barons looking out for their own interests, but above all it is the brotherly Ukrainian people, and we must think about all aspects of relations between Russia and Ukraine,\" he said Saturday afternoon at a meeting with his Security Council. \n",
      " Putin instructed Gazprom to supply gas to Ukraine through the first three months of the year at current prices, provided that by the end of the day Kiev sign a contract agreeing to pay market prices thereafter. But Ukraine said shortly before midnight that it would not sign the document. \n",
      " Ukrainian lawmaker Rudkovsky said the events of the last few weeks had demonstrated Ukraine's continuing dependence on good relations with Moscow. \"You can raise your campaign rating by struggling against Russia, but this is a very dangerous game in which you end up building a road which leads nowhere,\" he said. \n",
      " Russia is demanding that Ukraine begin to pay rates similar to those it charges Western European customers, which are more than four times higher. Ukraine presently pays the equivalent of $50 per 1,000 cubic meters in exchange for shipping additional Russian gas to Europe. \n",
      " Gazprom has demanded that Ukraine pay $230 per 1,000 cubic meters. The Ukraine government has said it is ready to pay market prices but insists on phasing them in gradually; Yushchenko is said to favor an initial increase to about $90. \n"

      "The following editorial appeared in Thursday's Washington Post: \n",
      " Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of race, color, gender, religion or national origin. It also requires that employees raise such claims of discrimination within 180 days \"after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\" On Tuesday, the Supreme Court ruled in a case that involved the question of when, in situations involving allegations of unequal pay, that 180-day clock starts ticking: Must the complaint be raised, as the five-justice majority found, within 180 days of the discriminatory pay decision -- even if the employee doesn't know at the time that she's being paid less than her male counterparts? Or, as four justices argued in a dissent written by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, does the \"unlawful employment practice\" recur with every paycheck in which a worker is paid less because of her gender? \n",
      " As a statutory matter, this is a difficult question. As the majority opinion, by Justice Samuel Alito, pointed out, Congress, in passing Title VII, took care to put in a strict time limit, and it didn't make an exception for unequal pay. Interpreting the \"unlawful employment practice\" to be repeated with every paycheck would make it difficult for employers to defend themselves against charges of discrimination that occurred long in the past. For instance, in the case the court decided, one major piece of evidence involved a supervisor who allegedly retaliated against the employee after she spurned his sexual advances; by the time the case came to trial, the supervisor had died. \n",
      " At the same time, as Ginsburg noted, pay discrimination is a different, more hidden phenomenon than bias in hiring or promotion: An employee may not have any reason to suspect that discrimination is at work or that male co-workers are being paid more. If an employee simply dallied before filing a discrimination claim, Ginsburg pointed out, courts would retain the equitable power to dismiss such cases. Allowing more leeway for pay discrimination claims would be in keeping with Title VII's \"core purpose\" of remedying discrimination in the workplace. Eight federal appeals courts and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency entrusted with enforcing Title VII, had adopted Ginsburg's view, compared with one that took the majority position. \n",
      " Whoever had the better reading of the statute, Ginsburg is clearly right on the policy: It's impossible for every victim of pay discrimination to know and take action within 180 days. Congress should adjust the law accordingly. The sensible approach would be to set filing time limits that take account of the differences between pay differentials and other, more easily discernible forms of discrimination. Employees shouldn't be prevented from complaining about discrimination that they had no way of knowing was taking place; employers shouldn't be at the mercy of tardy claims. Congress should move quickly to strike an appropriate balance between these two legitimate concerns.: [3346, 3296, 3236]\n",

      " The Iraq strategy that President Obama announced Friday was broadly faithful to his campaign promises, but it contained some important and praiseworthy adjustments. The president lengthened his 16-month timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops to 19 months, thus adopting the middle of the three options the Pentagon studied. He set a ceiling of 50,000 troops for the \"residual\" force he has always said would remain -- a figure that quickly prompted sniping from his party's left wing. He gave up his formula of withdrawing forces at the rate of a brigade a month, which will allow U.S. commanders to maintain a large force in the country through Iraq's crucial parliamentary elections at the end of this year. \n",
      " Most important, Obama spoke of Iraq not as a fiasco to be abandoned but as a \"great nation\" whose \"future ... is inseparable from the future of the broader Middle East.\" He said his administration aimed for \"a new era of American leadership and engagement\" in the region and \"will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, representative and accountable, and that provides neither support nor safe haven to terrorists.\" That is almost exactly how the Bush administration defined \"victory\" in Iraq. Thanks to the military and political successes of Bush's last two years, there is reason for hope that Obama's strategy can achieve that aim. \n",
      " The president's speech was not without hedges and contradictions. He said there would be limits to what the United States would do to stabilize Iraq, and he put Iraqis on notice that they must \"seize\" the opportunity they have been offered. Perhaps with his antiwar base in mind, he pronounced \"as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end.\" In the next breath, he promised to \"proceed carefully\" and \"consult closely\" with military commanders and the Iraqi government, and he said \"there will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments.\" Does that mean Obama is open to altering his plan if al-Qaeda or Iranian-backed militias rebound as U.S. troop levels decline? Some of the congressional leaders he briefed, including Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., seemed to think so; McCain called Obama's plan \"reasonable.\" \n",
      " Unfortunately for Obama, the initial response of some congressional Democrats was anything but reasonable. A number objected to the size of the residual force: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared that 15,000 or 20,000 would be more appropriate. Neither she nor other objectors explained why fewer troops were needed or expressed any interest in nurturing what Obama described as the \"renewed cause for hope in Iraq.\" That is a measure of Obama's statesmanship: Though he opposed the war, his strategy recognizes what has been achieved in Iraq, even at a terrible cost, and aims at preserving it. His party would do well to follow his lead.: [3066, 3009, 2968]\n",

Behind the seemingly endless supply of consumer goods arriving on Western shelves at two-for-one prices are people struggling on survival wages under bleak conditions to produce the cheap energy Chinese factories need. \n",
      " China, which produces 35 percent of the world's coal, accounts for 80 percent of coal mining fatalities, according to government figures -- 4,153 deaths were reported in the first nine months of 2004. Experts say corruption, poor oversight, and the fact that it's often cheaper to pay off a death claim than invest in safety equipment contribute to the country's dubious record. \n",

      " Sunday's explosion was not the last. Wednesday morning, 13 miners were killed by a blast at a coal mine in Guizhou Panxian, and three were missing, officials said. \n",
      " Before Sunday's blast, word in the mine was that Chenjiashan bosses manipulated gas-detection equipment -- a modern version of the canary in the shaft -- to avoid triggering alarms and work stoppages that could undercut production, several miners said. \n",
      " Fires were raging in the mine for a week before Sunday's blast, said one miner, who asked not to be identified. \n",
      " On Nov. 23, some supervisors who descended into the shaft to check a fire quickly retreated because they had trouble breathing. But they refused to let the miners leave, forcing them to fight the fire for 12 hours even though they were not trained. \n",
      " A few days later, the mine bosses divided the workers into firefighting, day shift and night shift crews in a bid to maintain production goals. \"This meant the usual five hours devoted to maintenance and repairs was reduced to three,\" the miner said, citing this as a possible factor in Sunday's explosion. \n",
      " Mine officials could not be reached for comment. \n",
      " Nor did government oversight seem to help. In April 2001, an accident in the same mine killed more than 35 workers, drawing attention from the government. But whenever inspectors fined the mining company for safety violations, the penalties were deducted from miners' wages to maintain profits, workers and family members said. \n",
      " The miners said they didn't have much choice. If they left, there were more farmers to fill their shoes. \n",
      " \"Workers are at the bottom of the barrel, the ones sacrificing everything,\" said Yu Zhanyin, 53, who lost a leg during a shaft collapse in the 1980s. \n",
      " President Hu Jintao has urged rescuers to do everything possible to save miners trapped in Chenjiashan even as his government mounted a campaign to close smaller, accident-prone mines. \n",
      " Where it often takes days for bad news to leak out, Beijing publicized Sunday's incident almost immediately. \n",
      " \"The central government believes a more open media will help pressure mine owners,\" said Li Xiguang, a former coal miner, now a professor at Beijing's Tsinghua University. \n",
      " That's small comfort to Zhao, who cooked dinner for her husband, Ding Aituan, late Saturday night and said goodbye as he went off to start his midnight shift. He looked haggard, and she asked why he was working the night shift two consecutive weeks. But he said his pay would be docked if he complained. \n",
      " On his way out, their son, Ding Jie, called to his father to buy him some zhenzhenbang, his favorite candy, then asked for a hug and a kiss, a rare request. Zhao said the image of her husband hugging their son haunts her because she believed it was probably their last embrace. \n",
      " At 8 a.m. Monday, a relative called to ask whether Ding Aituan was working the overnight shift. When Zhao confirmed that he was, the relative hung up without saying more. A couple of hours later, Zhao's sister-in-law arrived and told her the bad news: There'd been a big explosion, and Ding was missing. \n",
      " Long before her husband was trapped in the mine, Zhao says he was trapped by circumstances. There aren't many jobs in this region of scraggly hills in the heart of China's coal belt. After leaving school, he reluctantly followed his two older brothers and countless friends down the shaft. \n",
      " Although some of the 3,400 employees at the mine are lucky enough to work above ground maintaining equipment and doing other jobs, Ding was assigned to some of the most unsafe parts of the mine, for some of the lowest wages -- about $48 a month. \n",
      " His wife, friends and family say Ding is the kind of person -- gentle, kind, honest and considerate -- who can't say no, the type whose bosses quickly identify as a soft touch. \n",
      " For more than a decade, he worked more than his share of night shifts. Then early Sunday morning, his luck appeared to run out. \n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: \n",
      " The dueling accounts of a U.S. raid in western Afghanistan on Aug. 21 that may -- or may not -- have killed up to 90 Afghan civilians have a woeful familiarity. Both Afghan and United Nations officials say that their investigators corroborated the deaths and that U.S. special forces were misled into attacking a compound where a wake was taking place. American officials angrily -- if anonymously -- insist that no physical evidence backs accounts from villagers who may have been coerced by the Taliban. U.S. commanders still believe the raid succeeded in killing a Taliban commander and some 25 militants, along with five civilians. \n",
      " What's sure is that this sort of controversy -- as well as many undisputed episodes of civilian deaths -- have dogged U.S. forces in Afghanistan ever since the war began nearly seven years ago. More often than not, the wrongful killings are attributed to airstrikes. In the latest case, a compound was reportedly attacked with an AC-130 gunship, a weapon capable of massive and indiscriminate fire that has been implicated in shootings of civilians in the past. \n",
      " The Pentagon has, at least, become more sensitive to Afghan casualties in recent years, partly at the insistence of Afghan President Hamid Karzai. Procedures for authorizing air attacks have been tightened more than once, and officials can readily cite instances in which senior Taliban commanders have been located and then spared from airstrikes because of concern over nearby civilians. The United States proposed a joint commission with the Afghan government to investigate the Aug. 21 incident and also has promised investigations into three other U.S. airstrikes in July that Afghan reports said killed as many as 78 civilians. \n",
      " Notably, the proportion of Afghan civilian deaths caused by U.S. and coalition forces is down this year. But that toll -- 255 in the first half of 2008 -- is still tragically high. As Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, acknowledged last week, any collateral damage or loss of life \"really does set us back.\" Civilian deaths are helping to strengthen Afghan resentment of foreign forces, and a U.N. study showed they motivate many of the suicide bombings. Adm. Mullen also seems to understand that one of the best ways to reduce civilian deaths is to rely more on counterinsurgency operations by ground forces and less on airstrikes. He says that there is \"an urgent requirement\" to send additional troops to Afghanistan -- and he's right.: [2964, 2923, 2888]\n",

      "On Oct. 10, 2002, Hillary Rodham Clinton stood in the Senate to explain why she was authorizing President Bush to use force against Iraq: \"In balancing the risks of action versus inaction, I think New Yorkers who have gone through the fires of hell may be more attuned to the risk of not acting. I know that I am.\" \n",
      " As the war went from triumph to fiasco -- the death toll in American lives crossed 4,000 last week -- Clinton told angry Democrats that she had been misled by the Bush administration's selective use of intelligence about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. What she failed to say is that, by her own admission, her decision was the result of a powerful psychological bias. \n",
      " The action bias, or the desire to do something rather than nothing when you have just been through a terrible experience, plays a powerful role in our lives. It influences individuals and companies, investors and leaders. You can see the action bias on display in current thinking on the housing and economic crises, in the bitter debates over the war in Iraq -- even in discussions about how to fix a football team that's a perennial loser. \n",
      " When people suffer losses and confront the possibility of even greater reverses -- it doesn't matter if you are talking about a terrorist attack or a meltdown in retirement savings -- it is psychologically difficult to do nothing, to hold course. This is true even when the action you contemplate produces an outcome that leaves you demonstrably worse than you were in the first place. \n",
      " While the Iraq war might be Exhibit A for the action bias, the phenomenon is a familiar face in most presidential contests. Elections revolve around problems that the nation is confronting, so it is not surprising that candidates routinely spout the mantra of change. When things feel wrong, we experience a compelling attraction to a change of course -- any change. This is the definition of the action bias. \n",
      " Economist Ofer Azar recently came up with a novel way to study the insidious nature of the action bias. He examined whether soccer goalies were more likely to stop penalty kicks when they dived to the left, dived to the right or stayed in the center of the goal. In a study of 286 penalty kicks faced by elite Israeli goalkeepers, Azar found that goalies had the best chance of stopping a kick when they remained in the center -- partly because when they dived to one side, they left themselves with no chance of stopping a kick aimed at the other side or a kick aimed dead center. And even when they correctly guessed the direction of the kick, they still had only a 1-in-4 chance of stopping a goal. \n",
      " Despite the clarity of the evidence, Azar found that goalies dived to one side or the other 93 percent of the time. \n",
      " During the 2006 World Cup soccer championship, which ended after a nine-penalty-kick shootout between Italy and France, both the French and Italian goalies dived to one side or the other every single time. Neither got so much as a hand on the ball. The goalies failed to correctly guess the direction of the penalty kick seven times (including two that were dead center) and failed to stop goals the two times that they did guess right. Italy won only because one of France's penalty kicks hit the crossbar. \n",
      " Azar, who works at the Guilford Glazer School of Business and Management at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, believes that goalies, like politicians and Federal Reserve chairmen who have to decide on whether to change interest rates, are powerfully influenced by norms. In bad times -- and it doesn't matter whether you are trying to stop penalty kicks or a recession -- the norm is to act. If you're a goalie, you dive to one side. If you are chairman of the Fed, you cut rates. If you are a politician trying to head off a terrorist attack, you gravitate toward action. \n",
      " One of the insights produced by Azar and Marcel Zeelenberg, a social psychologist at Tilburg University in the Netherlands who also studies the action bias, is that different biases are activated in good and bad times. When things are going badly, it is difficult to choose inaction. When things are going well, however, it is difficult to make any changes -- because who wants to be blamed for ruining something that is going well? \n",
      " This is why, when your stock portfolio is performing spectacularly, the powerful temptation is to leave it exactly the way it is, rather than sell and take profits. But when your stocks are doing poorly, there is a powerful urge to cut and run. Buying high and selling low is a poor investment strategy, but it makes perfect psychological sense. \n",
      " The same phenomenon is at work when it comes to people's beliefs about their careers and relationships. When things are going well, there is a tendency to stagnate, rather than innovate and make things even better. When things are going poorly, on the other hand, our bias is to flail. \n",
      " In the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the action bias explains why Clinton and most U.S. politicians were biased toward action -- any action. Trying something that failed was psychologically preferable to facing accusations of \"having done nothing.\" \n"

      " \"Some of the larger and stronger colleges were sort of like duchies, accustomed to making their own arrangements in Sacramento,\" Heilbron told the center when he was 83, referring to state colleges in San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose. \"They didn't particularly want to be part of a system. So we had to deal with that and ... take care of the smaller, weaker institutions.\" \n",

      " The same goes for front-runners John McCain and Rudy Giuliani in the race for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. They ought to be drawing attention to Mitt Romney, or to \"Law and Order\" star Fred Thompson, who could be running third in the race if he declared. \n",
      " Front-runners are usually focused on racing each other. They often do not realize that when people cannot decide between two leading candidates -- and it doesn't matter whether we are talking about politicians or consumer appliances -- our decision can be subtly swayed by whoever is in third place. \n",

Under no circumstances should they cause the vote share of either front-runner to INCREASE. In the actual world, however, third candidates regularly have the unintended effect of making one of the front-runners look better than before in the minds of undecided voters. \n",
      " Joel Huber, a Duke University marketing professor, showed how the decoy effect works with restaurants. Huber asked people whether they would prefer to eat at a five-star restaurant that was far away or at a three-star restaurant nearby. As with many choices in life, each restaurant had different advantages. If the better restaurant was also nearby, there would be no dilemma. But the question forced people to compare apples and oranges -- trade off quality against convenience -- which ensured no automatic answer. \n",
      " The human brain, however, always seeks simple answers. Enter the third candidate. Huber told some people there was also a choice of a four-star restaurant that was farther away than the five-star option. People now gravitated toward the five-star choice, since it was better and closer than the third candidate. (The three-star restaurant was closer, but not as good as the new candidate.) \n",
      " Another group was given a different third candidate, a two-star restaurant halfway between the first two. Many people now chose the three-star restaurant, because it beat the new option on convenience and quality. (The five-star restaurant outdid this third candidate on only one measure, quality.) \n",
      " What the decoy effect basically shows is that when people cannot decide between two front-runners, they use the third candidate as a sort of measuring stick. If one front-runner looks much better than the third candidate, people gravitate toward that front-runner. Third candidates, in other words, can make a complicated decision feel simple. \n",

      " Let's say you are a centrist Democratic voter who cannot decide between Clinton and Obama because you want a candidate who is strong on national security but also someone fresh.

Obama looks better than Edwards on both counts, whereas Clinton beats Edwards on only the national security issue. \n",
      " On the other hand, let's say you care about experience but are wary of policies such as universal health care. You like Clinton's experience but are worried about her track record on health care. Enter Edwards, whom you perceive to be as untested as Obama but even more likely to pursue a traditionally liberal agenda. Clinton now looks better than Edwards on both counts. \n",
      " What this means is that Obama and Clinton stand to gain by drawing attention to those qualities of Edwards's that make each front-runner look much better than the other. Clever front-runners, in other words, can turn third candidates into their wingmen. \n",
      " \"Many people lavished hate on Ralph Nader for presumably taking votes away from the Democratic front-runner in the 2000 presidential election,\" said Scott Highhouse, who has studied the decoy effect at Bowling Green State University. \"Research on the decoy effect suggests that Nader's presence, rather than taking votes away, probably increased the share of votes for the candidate he most resembled.\" \n",

      "The following editorial appeared in Sunday's Washington Post: \n",
      " WASHINGTON -- You know there's something terribly wrong with the public financing system for presidential campaigns when candidates turn to it only out of desperation and find themselves at a significant strategic disadvantage by taking public funds. Former North Carolina senator John Edwards once said he would skip the opportunity to collect matching funds for the primaries in order to compete on the same unlimited playing field as fellow Democrats Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama. On Thursday, Edwards, appearing to make a virtue out of necessity, said that he was making the move to \"step up\" on the issue because \"Washington is awash with money, and the system is corrupt.\" \n",
      " It's hard to believe that Edwards would be stepping up to take the public funds if he were awash with the $60 million or so that Clinton and Obama collected in the first half of the year. Edwards raised $23 million, which would have been an impressive sum in previous cycles but seems paltry this time around. That has prompted Edwards to say he will take the matching funds -- a move that will provide a needed infusion of cash when the money becomes available in January. Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, in even worse financial straits, is also poised to take the matching funds. \n",
      " The catch with public financing -- in which candidates receive federal matching funds for the first $250 of every donation they collect -- is twofold: First, candidates who take the money are constrained by ridiculously low limits on what they are permitted to spend in individual states. In Iowa, for example, where unfettered candidates could end up spending $15 million or more, the official limit is $1.5 million. Second, candidates who stay within the system are limited in their overall spending on primaries -- and because the official primary season stretches all the way until the national conventions, a candidate who took public financing and managed to win the nomination would be hamstrung against a nominee of the opposite party who had no spending limits. \n",
      " The bright side of the moves by Edwards and McCain is that they put a spotlight on an outmoded system and may help spur the legislative fix that is needed -- not in time for this election, but for 2012. The state-by-state limits need to be junked. The primary spending cap -- about $50 million this election -- needs to be raised dramatically to accommodate the reality of expensive modern primary campaigns. The matching-funds system needs to be overhauled to make more money available, preferably by providing a multiple match -- perhaps 4 to 1 -- for the first few hundred dollars collected. Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., has introduced such a measure, with Obama as a co-sponsor. Clinton hasn't signed on, but she told George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last week that \"at the end of the day, we should be moving toward public financing.\" If nothing else, the spectacle of the 2008 money chase and Edwards's plight ought to help make that happen.: [3474, 3401, 3353]\n",

      " Roy Disney also said that under Eisner's leadership, the company's finances and reputation had been damaged in seven critical areas, from the faltering fortunes of its ABC television and theme parks to problems with morale because of \"your consistent micro-management of everyone around you. ...\" \n",
      " Roy Disney also was critical of Eisner for his \"consistent refusal to establish a clear succession plan.\" The 61-year-old executive has been chairman since 1984. \n",
      " The timing of Roy Disney's resignation surprised some analysts and investors, noting that the company's financial performance has improved in the last year, especially in the studio division, which had a string of box office hits this summer. Disney's stock, which closed at $23.09 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, is up nearly 42 percent this year. \n",
      " \"Disney has blocked and tackled pretty well against an economy that has fallen off a cliff,\" said David Miller, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Los Angeles. \n",
      " In recent months, Eisner and his company also have taken steps to change the long-held perception that the directors are beholden to Eisner. Among other things, the company has named more independent directors and cut the size of its 17-member board down to 13. \n",
      " But Roy Disney's resignation could fuel those still-lingering perceptions, especially coming after the departure of board member Andrea Van de Kamp earlier this year. She accused Eisner of forcing her out because of her stern criticisms of his management. Eisner has said she was removed because the board was being reduced in size, not because of her views on him. \n",
      " (Begin optional trim) \n",
      " Roy Disney's resignation is reminiscent of actions he took nearly 20 years ago that helped lead to the last major shake-up at the company. Roy Disney resigned from the board in protest over the company's then management. But he and Gold, along with such heavyweight investors as the Bass family of Texas, engineered a board room coup that brought in Eisner and his right hand man, former Disney President Frank Wells. \n",
      " With Roy Disney invited back as a director, Eisner and Wells led one of the biggest corporate turnarounds in history in a successful partnership that ended when Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994. \n",
      " During the turnaround, Roy Disney became the godfather and protector of the company's animation unit. One of his offices on the Disney lot sat in the center of a room built to resemble the cap Mickey Mouse wore as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in Disney's \"Fantasia.\" \n",
      " (End optional trim) \n",
      " All told, Roy Disney's family holds about $600 million worth of company stock. Although sizable, that would not be enough to mount a major challenge, given the company's market capitalization of nearly $50 billion. Eisner's own holdings are now about equal to Roy Disney's. \n",
      " The resignation capped nearly two years of frustrations that had been building as relations between Eisner and Roy Disney chilled. Roy Disney nearly quit the board in protest several times over the past two years, according to sources close to the executive, and he has kept draft resignation letters in his files. \n",
      " Disney has complained to confidants that he was being marginalized by Eisner on company business, and that Eisner would demand to know about any conversations employees had with him. Disney would schedule clandestine meetings with executives, swearing them to secrecy. \n",
      " In early November, those sources said, Roy Disney learned that the board's four-member nominating committee, led by Edison International Chairman John Bryson, was planning to leave his name off the slate of directors scheduled to be elected at the company's next annual meeting. \n",
      " Roy Disney met with Bryson and was told that the committee wanted him to abide by the company's governance rules that set 72 as the retirement age for all directors except those who have served as chief executive. Bryson, through an Edison spokesman, declined comment. \n",
      " Sources said Roy Disney told Bryson he believed that the committee had the flexibility to waive the requirement -- especially since he was a member of the Disney family -- and that he would not abide by the request to retire. He also voiced his concerns about what he believes are the company's declining fortunes. He told his inner circle: \"It's not about me, it's about the company.\" \n",
      " Bryson promised to take it up with the committee, which also included Packet Design Chief Executive Judy Estrin and Northwest Airlines Corp. Chairman Gary L. Wilson. \n",
      " But Roy Disney, sources familiar with the events said, decided he'd had enough and chose to pull the trigger on his resignation before hearing back from Bryson. He drafted a letter, but held off so he could consult his wife, Patty, as well as Gold and two longtime business associates at his Shamrock Holdings investment group. Just a week ago, Roy Disney received a pin from the company for 50 years of service. \n",
      " In his letter to Eisner, Roy Disney let the chairman know how he felt. \"I don't know if you and other directors can comprehend how painful it is for me and other directors to arrive at this decision.\" \n",

      " NEW YORK -- The city and many out-of-towners rang in the new year Wednesday night with the usual merry air, ignoring talk of terrorism and doing the silly things that seem appropriate for the occasion. \n",
      " New York's Times Square was jammed with more than 750,000 people, some of whom seemed to think that wearing a kilt on Dec. 31 was just as natural as playing card games on the sidewalk for six hours while waiting for the ball to drop. \n",
      " A common complaint was the lack of public bathrooms, but good humor seemed to prevail as revelers passed police checkpoints and were searched for contraband. \n",
      " \"This is my first year in New York, so I had to come here,\" said Thomas Boi, 39, a medical student who recently moved to New York from California. \"I'm happy that I'm in the best city in the world. This is what New Yorkers do.\" \n",
      " Heavily armed police were a reminder that the threat of terrorism has now replaced teenage rowdyism as the major concern about the event, which is seen by an estimated 1 billion people worldwide. \n",
      " \"I'm here to have a good time, and I'm not going to let the terrorism thing worry me at all,\" said Erin Termeer, 28, a nurse from Kalamazoo, Mich., who was accompanied by her husband, Tom, 35. \n",
      " The couple whiled away the hours before the ball dropped by playing go fish with a deck of I Love NY playing cards. \n",
      " The crowd seemed heavily tilted toward tourists. One television reporter shouted to a throng: \"Anyone here from the city?\" No one answered. \n",
      " \"We're loving it. We're loving the energy,\" said Quandria Williams, 26, a customer service representative from Chicago. \n",
      " Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said police and other city agencies had been planning the event for months and expected it to go smoothly. \n",
      " \"My advice to everybody is to leave the worrying about it to the professionals. That is their job,\" the mayor said. \n",
      " Kelly said the main difference this year has been the use of more undercover police officers and the deployment of a new, high-tech helicopter. \n",
      " The celebration is hosted by the Times Square Business Improvement District, a quasi-public agency. \n",
      " Orange top hats and oversized eyeglass frames reading \"2004\" were popular ornamentations for the crowd, which is usually noted for its exuberance, not its sense of taste. \n",

      "The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft hurtled through the rings of Saturn and headed into planetary orbit late Wednesday, in an apparent pinpoint finish to a bold 2-billion-mile journey through space to embark on a four-year exploration of the solar system's sixth planet, its rings and its moons in the most ambitious space science project ever undertaken. \n",
      " Locked in the grip of Saturn's gravity and traveling at a speed of 50,331 mph, Cassini-Huygens breached the 15,000-mile-wide gap between the planet's F and G rings at 10:11 p.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, turned its back end forward and fired its main rocket in a 96-minute \"burn\" to brake its progress. \n",
      " At 10:25 p.m. scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory applauded as the spacecraft, apparently unscathed, sent a radio transmission confirming that it was safely through the rings. \n",
      " Eleven minutes later, louder applause broke out as the burn began steering the spacecraft on an arc that would bring it within a scant 12,400 miles of Saturn's cloud tops. With that confirmation, the roomful of scientists and engineers in mission control shook hands, embraced and exchanged high-fives. \n",
      " The burn was to end at 12:12 a.m. Thursday, when Cassini-Huygens was scheduled to turn on its cameras for close-up photographs as it sped back through the rings on the first of 76 planned orbits of Saturn. Its first images were expected before noon Thursday. \n",
      " The spacecraft's mission, unmatched in the history of space travel, is to tour Saturn and its environs for four years -- and perhaps decades longer -- using 18 instruments provided by 17 nations. Saturn and its entourage in many respects operate like a smaller version of the solar system, and astronomers hope that the spacecraft will yield crucial insights into how the sun and its planets, and perhaps life itself, came to be. \n",
      " For mission controllers, Wednesday was a day of nail-biting anticipation. The maneuvers associated with orbit insertion, including contingency plans to cope with emergencies, had been programmed into the spacecraft more than a year ago. After a final uplinked software \"tweak\" last weekend there was nothing for them to do but listen for radio transmissions from their distant traveler as each maneuver unfolded. \n",
      " The final approach began at noon Wednesday when the spacecraft calibrated its accelerometer, which used the rate of speed to signal when to switch the main rocket engine on and off, said spacecraft team chief Julie Webster. Next, at 3:30 p.m., the spacecraft began warming up parts of its engine to aim its thrust properly before beginning the burn. \n",
      " Navigational team chief Jeremy Jones watched Cassini-Huygens gain speed as Saturn's gravity embraced it in an ever-tighter grasp. At noon, it was traveling at 26,843 mph, Jones said, but velocity had almost doubled by the time it passed through the rings, and crested at 68,763 mph when it reached its closest point of approach to the planet. \n",
      " Had the 96-minute burn gone awry, the spacecraft was programmed to diagnose the problem and take action -- including firing an auxiliary engine after a short interval. Webster had said she did not expect any problems. \"My team has run this sequence 200 or 300 times in simulation and we have already had 17 engine burns, and nothing has ever gone wrong.\" \n",
      " Although her prediction apparently proved true, planners made no secret that the dash through Saturn's outer rings was the most exacting and potentially dangerous maneuver of the entire mission. \"We're not flying where we are for science,\" program manager Robert Mitchell said. Passing through the rings was the only way to get close enough for Saturn's gravity to pull the spacecraft into the proper orbit, he said. \n",
      " In its explorations, Cassini-Huygens -- a $3.3 billion joint venture involving NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency -- will treat Saturn as a surrogate \"sun,\" with its rings modeling the \"dust disc\" of a solar system and its 31 moons acting as planets. The spacecraft will study the dynamics of the Saturnian system and do close flybys of seven moons.: [3699, 3677, 3576]\n",

      "Suspected Tamil militants struck with deadly fury Wednesday in the heart of Sri Lanka's capital, smashing a truckload of explosives into the Central Bank building and detonating a mammoth blast that killed at least 60 people, wounded as many as 1,400 and reduced much of Colombo's business district to rubble and flames. \n",
      " The suicide bombing was the most devastating and deadly attack in Sri Lanka's most important city since armed insurgents in the Indian Ocean island nation began battling 12Â½ years ago for a separate homeland for their Tamil minority. \n",
      " The midmorning explosion on a working day left bodies strewn by the dozens on streets and in wrecked buildings. At least half a dozen high-rises caught fire, and the blazes kept police and rescue workers from digging through the debris for survivors. \n",
      " Panicked workers, many of whose shirts or saris were soaked with blood, fled the downtown neighborhood on foot. Helicopters carried large buckets of water to douse the burning buildings and tried to rescue scores of frightened people trapped on upper floors. \n",
      " Sri Lankan police Thursday identified the suicide bomber as a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have staged numerous suicide bombings in the past. Two other members of the group  -- arrested as they fled the scene in a hijacked scooter-rickshaw --  participated in the attack, the police said. \n",
      " \"This incident has all the hallmarks of the (Tigers),\" Ravinatha P. Aryasinha, the Foreign Ministry's director of publicity, said Wednesday. \n",
      " Military sources said the truck had been packed with 440 pounds of explosives. \n",
      " Of the known wounded, 100 were in critical condition, hospital sources said. The casualty toll seemed certain to rise as rescue workers sifted the rubble in search of victims. \n",
      " \"There are still several people trapped inside the burning buildings. We have to first put out the fire and try to save as many as possible,\" a police officer said. Officials said 3,000 people worked in the Central Bank building alone, and it could be days before rescue work is complete. \n",
      " Thick black columns of smoke rose over the seaside district from the burning buildings, and the air was rent with the shrieks of ambulances. \n",
      " The bombing showed that despite recent setbacks in the civil war, including the Tigers' loss of their northern capital and citadel, Jaffna, in December, the rebels remain a deadly force to be contended with. They are clearly capable of piercing the heavy security cordons thrown up by the armed forces and police in Colombo. \n",
      " The attack was also a blow to President Chandrika Kumaratunga's effort to end the ethnically fueled strife that has claimed at least 39,000 lives since 1983. The Defense Ministry, in a statement, accused the Tigers of carrying out the bombing to generate \"communal backlash\" among the majority Sinhalese against Tamils. \n",
      " There were conflicting reports about how the explosion occurred, but there appeared to be general agreement that the attackers drove an Indian-made truck into the security barricade outside the Central Bank, where Sri Lanka's gold reserves are held and the country's financial policy is made. \n",
      " Some reports said one passenger carrying explosives on his body jumped out of the truck and detonated himself and the vehicle, while five accomplices escaped. Other reports said two men leaped from the truck and opened fire, scattering most of the bank's security guards. \n",
      " \"It was a suicide mission,\" one official told the United News of India agency. It was not immediately clear how many of the bombers died. \n",
      " The explosion, so powerful it gouged an eight-foot crater in the ground and was heard miles away, caved in the front of the nine-story bank building and shattered nearby high-rises. \n",
      " Tourist hotels, travel agencies, airline offices, private banks and other businesses in Colombo's oldest district were badly damaged. Millions of dollars of damage was done to the city's 39-story twin-tower World Trade Center, which was still under construction. \n",
      " Telephone service was knocked out, and many of the wounded had to be transported to hospitals in public buses or private cars. \n",
      " The Central Bank, on one of the city's busiest thoroughfares, is about 150 yards from the Presidential Secretariat. However, Kumaratunga, whose father and husband were assassinated, spends most of her time in the walled Temple Trees complex in another city neighborhood. \n",
      " Hours after the huge explosion, an eyewitness said the scene in the capital of 1.2 million people was still one of \"utter devastation and chaos.\" \n",
      " At least 1,000 police, army troops and civilian volunteers, many stunned by the magnitude of the death and destruction, were milling about streets strewn with broken glass. \n",
      " A terrorist act of this type, if not on such a devastating scale, had been expected in the Sri Lankan capital, and roadblocks to guard against suicide car bombings had been erected around some buildings. \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " The attack came two weeks after Kumaratunga offered a formal draft of a plan to give the Tamil minority more say over its own affairs. \n",
      " Government officials said the attack seemed designed to torpedo the proposal, which mainstream Tamil political parties have welcomed with reservations. \n"

      "The following editorial appeared in Friday's Washington Post: \n",
      " The candidates in the Republican debate Wednesday night made a great deal of sense about immigration -- when they were discussing measures they'd implemented as leaders forced to deal with reality. At least two of them turned to ugly nonsense as soon as they weren't defending their own records. \n",
      " Former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, for example, explained why New York allowed illegal immigrants to receive some services when he was in charge. \"If we didn't allow the children of illegal immigrants to go to school, we would have had 70,000 children on the streets at a time in which New York City was going through a massive crime wave,\" Giuliani said. \"If we didn't allow illegals to report crimes, a lot of criminals would have gone free because they're the ones who had the information.\" Reasonable. \n",
      " Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney in turn took umbrage at Giuliani's suggestion that the governor should have reported illegal immigrants doing yard work at his home. \"Are you suggesting, Mayor, that if you have a company that you hired who provide a service, that you now are responsible for going out and checking the employees of that company, particularly those that might look different or don't have an accent like yours, and ask for their papers -- I don't think that's American, number one.\" Eloquent. \n",
      " And former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee explained why he wanted to offer academic scholarships to the children of illegal immigrants if they excelled in Arkansas schools, were drug- and alcohol-free and were seeking U.S. citizenship. \"It accomplished two things that we knew we wanted to do,\" Huckabee said, \"and that is, number one, bring people from illegal status to legal status. And the second thing, we wanted people to be taxpayers, not tax-takers.\" That, too, makes the kind of sense that both Romney and Giuliani once seemed to understand. \n",
      " Yet Romney rounded on Huckabee for supporting the scholarships, and Giuliani rounded on Romney for his \"sanctuary mansion.\" As governor and mayor they had to deal with reality -- that this country benefits from immigrant labor, that 12 million illegal immigrants are not going to be corralled and deported, and so on. As candidates, Giuliani and Romney are content to tell voters what they think they want to hear, a particular Romney specialty. \n",
      " Only Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Huckabee on Wednesday night declined to join in the fantasy that fences and border guards alone can answer the nation's immigration questions. McCain said he understands voter anger and believes that the government must respond by sealing the border first, but he insisted that the challenge of the 12 million undocumented migrants, and the need for guest labor, eventually must be dealt with, too. \"And we need to sit down as Americans and recognize these are God's children as well,\" McCain said. \n",
      " For his part, Huckabee said, \"In all due respect, we are a better country than to punish children for what their parents did.\" Maybe so. You wouldn't know it from listening to the putative leaders of the Republican Party.: [3195, 3144, 3102]\n",

      "The columnist George Will recently wrote that the Republicans were routed in the November elections because of \"war leadership even worse than during the War of 1812.\" Mr. Will's words carry great weight, because he is among our leading conservative thinkers and was on record opposing both the Iraq war and the War of 1812 from the beginning. \n",
      " But let's be frank: Most of us don't know anything about the War of 1812 other than the approximate date and the fact that one of the two sides was probably the United States of America (because why else would we have heard of it?). Let me divulge details of this conflict, so that the next time the War of 1812 comes up at a party, you'll be so knowledgeable that the other partygoers will refer to you as the War of 1812 Expert, which will, in turn, make you the object of feverish sexual fantasies. \n",
      " Our opponent, or perhaps \"enemy\" is the technical term, was Great Britain. Perversely, the War of 1812 also took place in 1813, 1814 and early 1815, and thus should really be called the \"War of 1812ish.\" \n",
      " The war was arguably unnecessary. At the very least, it was an optional war, a war of choice -- if you can imagine such a thing. We'd fought the enemy before, and won, but somehow got the notion that we needed to fight the enemy again. The British were hardly blameless -- they had a nasty habit of kidnapping our sailors -- but the \"war hawks\" in America greatly exaggerated the threat posed by the enemy. \n",
      " The fools. \n",
      " How bad was our war management? Well, until recently there were three levels of wartime incompetence: Bad, Very Bad and War of 1812 Bad. Contemplate the fact that, in August 1814, the very refined first lady of the United States was forced to flee the White House and spend the night on the lam, hauled by carriage on dark country roads and finally deposited in a tavern to be hectored by fellow refugees from Washington. \n",
      " Dolley Madison was, in truth, a hero, having stuck it out at the White House to the last possible moment (and having saved the famous portrait of a grim, humorless George Washington). Not so brilliant was the performance of the general assigned to protect the capital, William Winder, who had a gift for dithering around and running away. Historian Henry Adams wrote, \"When he might have prepared defences, he acted as scout; when he might have fought, he still scouted; when he retreated, he retreated in the wrong direction; when he fought, he thought only of retreat; and whether scouting, retreating, or fighting, he never betrayed an idea.\" \n",
      " Our leaders lacked a winnable strategy. Worse, they failed to anticipate what might go wrong. (The mind reels.) As British ships sailed up the Chesapeake Bay, someone warned the commander of the Army, John Armstrong Jr., that the Brits might sack Washington. \"No, no! Baltimore is the place, sir; that is of so much more consequence,\" Armstrong responded. He never bothered to erect a single battery to protect the capital, not even a sign saying \"Keep Out\" or \"Bad Dog.\" \n",
      " We fought the war without enough troops. (!) We relied mostly on militiamen, which is to say, farmers with hunting rifles. A British officer described them as \"country-people, who would have been much more appropriately employed in attending to their agricultural occupations than in standing with muskets in their hands.\" \n",
      " His forces smashed, Winder retreated past the capital, deep into Montgomery County, Md., and would have kept going to the Pacific if his men had not been exhausted. \n",
      " President James Madison, more suited to desk work (he helped write a little thing we call the Constitution), did his best to gallop around the front lines to avert catastrophe, but he finally fled to the country, while the British marched into Washington, ate all the food on his dining room table, drank his wine and burned down his house. That wasn't the rocket's red glare that lighted up the sky; that was his furniture on fire. \"Before midnight the flames of three great conflagrations made the whole country light,\" Adams wrote, \"and from the distant hills of Maryland and Virginia the flying President and Cabinet caught glimpses of the ruin their incompetence had caused.\" That's rock bottom. That's what we mean by War of 1812 Bad. And maybe in a few years, historians will be able to tell us if there's a new standard. End adv sun dec 3: [2882, 2840, 2774]\n",

      "Even before the jury in the O.J. Simpson murder trial was sequestered, both sides tried to alter the panel to their advantage, transcripts released Friday reveal. \n",
      " A Latina was dismissed from the panel, at the behest of defense lawyers, a week before opening statements because she had failed to disclose that she had been beaten by her ex-boyfriend. In addition, a black man was removed at the urging of prosecutors, who said he lied when he said he had never met Simpson. \n",
      " At a session in Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's chambers, the 38-year-old woman acknowledged that she had been pummeled by her estranged boyfriend after she had been selected to serve in the high-profile case. \n",
      " \"He beat ... me,\" she said at a hearing in the judge's chambers Jan. 9. \"And I don't know if you guys had noticed. \n",
      " \"My face was pretty bruised, and I wanted to say something to you, but I just didn't want it to affect my position so I just kept it to myself,\" the woman said. \n",
      " The woman, identified only as Juror 320, insisted she could be fair, despite the fact that a key contention in the prosecution's case is that Simpson had beaten beat his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. \"I have an open mind,\" she said. \n",
      " Although sources earlier divulged sketchy information on why these jurors were dismissed, a bevy of details emerged in hundreds of pages of transcripts released by Ito on Friday at the request of the American Civil Liberties Union, news media organizations and a juror dismissed in May. Transcripts of hearings concerning eight other dismissed jurors are scheduled to be released next week. \n",
      " Juror 320 also denied her ex-boyfriend's accusations that she was a racist. Defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. clearly wanted her off the jury. But prosecutor Marcia Clark tried strenuously to keep the woman on the panel. \n",
      " At the first hearing concerning the woman in December, Clark said she had thought the woman's bruise was \"a cold sore.\" \n",
      " Clark accused the defense of changing their minds about the panel: \"They don't like the bargain they struck in accepting her.\" Clark said the woman admitted that she had been mentally abused but denied physical abuse. Since there was no physical injury, Clark said, \"She did not consider pushing and shoving to be physical abuse.\" \n",
      " Although Clark had been informed about the woman's beating, the prosecutor maintained that the juror's original response was a \"very understandable and normal and plausible reason for not concluding that there was abuse in the relationship. \n",
      " \"I wonder if there's anyone present who hasn't had physical contact with someone they've been intimate with, of the nature where there's no physical injury involved,\" Clark said. \n",
      " \"Mr. Shapiro raised his hand (that he hadn't), but you'll notice no one else did, myself included,\" she added. \n",
      " But Ito rejected Clark's plea and dismissed the woman Jan. 18. He urged her to get help from a battered women's program and said that his clerk could assist. \n",
      " The judge, almost apologetically, told the juror that he had stayed up all night thinking about her situation and said he felt compelled to dismiss her. \"The situation that you were in with Mr. R (the unnamed former boyfriend) is a horrible situation too close to the facts in the Simpson case.\" \n",
      " Ito stressed that he was not dismissing her because of anything she had done. However, he expressed fear that she could wind up as \"a victim of a very similar situation to the facts of this case.\" \n",
      " Ito also dismissed the black man, a Hertz Corp. employee, on Jan. 18. Ito's action stemmed from a lengthy probe launched after prosecutors were notified by the Star tabloid newspaper that the panelist, identified only as Juror 228, might have met Simpson, a Hertz spokesman for many years, and shaken his hand at a 1982 company function. \n",
      " On his jury questionnaire and during repeated questioning over a month of investigation, the 48-year-old man denied ever having met the former football star. \n",
      " \"I spoke the truth at the beginning,\" the man said. \"If I had to say this a thousand times, it still remains the same.\" \n",
      " Including these two, 10 jurors have been dismissed from the Simpson panel, leaving only two alternates. Numerous details were excised from the transcripts released Friday in an attempt to hide identities of witnesses who testified at juror hearings. \n",

      " The most explosive material in Friday's transcripts dealt with the Latina postal worker whose estranged former boyfriend called both the prosecution and the defense in an attempt to get her off the jury. \n",
      " The man accused the juror of loathing African Americans, being emotionally unfit to serve on the high-profile case and of prejudging Simpson guilty. Both the juror and her ex-boyfriend were interviewed on Jan. 9. \n",
      " The ex-boyfriend, who said he lived with the woman for 14 years and had a daughter with her, told Ito and attorneys that she had been prejudiced against blacks since she was \"accosted\" by a black man as a child. He added that she had even avoided living in certain neighborhoods because there were too many black people. \n",
      " The woman denied being a racist and said she had not prejudged Simpson. But she acknowledged that she had been beaten by her former boyfriend -- whom she saw periodically because they have joint custody of their child -- even after being selected to the jury. \n",

      "In his speech at the U.S. Army War College on May 24, President Bush stated, \"Iraqis will write their own history and find their own way.\" To applause, the president promised, if the new Iraqi government agreed, to \"demolish the Abu Ghraib prison.\" But to write their own history and chart their own way, the government and citizens of Iraq will need proof of what they endured during Saddam Hussein's rule and even afterward. Abu Ghraib prison is just such proof. \n",
      " That's why, instead of being razed, Abu Ghraib should be turned into a museum. \n",
      " It is tempting to get rid of symbols of a time when our world went awry. But it is a temptation we must resist if we are to succeed in forming a sense of conscience. As the French bishop Olivier de Berranger said in 1997, \"Conscience is formed by memory, and no society can live in peace with itself on the basis of a false or repressed past any more than an individual can.\" His words (part of a statement of repentance for the Catholic Church's silence about the persecution and deportation of Jews during World War II) carried special power because of the place where he uttered them: a former transit camp outside Paris, in front of a sealed cattle car like the ones used in the early 1940s to transport more than 70,000 Jews to their deaths in Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp. \n",
      " Whenever a nation passes through a trauma involving profound abuses of human rights and dignity, or when a people achieves a victory for human advancement, the facts of what transpired -- the actors and strategies involved and the final outcome -- all need to be substantiated so that people may use the memory of that event to reject or emulate past behavior. \n",
      " In the same way that hikers in difficult terrain need cairns to mark their way, so do we all need physical markers to keep us off the wrong path of life. Imagine a world where no one had bothered to preserve the Slaves' House in Senegal, Nazi concentration camps, places of torture used by the dictatorship in Argentina, an almshouse in England, the internment camp for Japanese Americans at Manzanar, or the lonely church in South Africa's District Six, a colored neighborhood in Cape Town razed by the apartheid government to make way for a whites-only development. Imagine a world bereft of places associated with positive memories, a world in which we could not visit the birthplaces of Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King Jr.; or Val-Kill, where Eleanor Roosevelt drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; or Thomas Jefferson's home at Monticello. Imagine that, and you will have conjured a world that has abandoned the task of molding conscience. \n",
      " I felt the power of place when I walked beneath an ominous guard tower through the barbed wire gates of Perm-36, a former Soviet labor camp. Now the Gulag Museum, Perm-36 was once home to some of Russia's leading political prisoners. It was also part of Joseph Stalin's scheme to industrialize Russia. More than 90 percent of Russian families claim someone who was sent to a labor camp. The bleak place speaks, as nothing else can, to the insanity and cruelty of it all -- the tiny, unheated cells, shared by four people in scanty clothing in sub-zero temperatures, the worm-infested gruel, the backbreaking work and the loss of contact with loved ones -- for up to 25 years -- simply for writing a poem, making a speech or just being young and strong and needed for the revolution. \n",
      " The museum exhibits the lengths to which prisoners went in order to survive and keep their humanity intact. Their art, poems and stories have been lovingly preserved. Even the guards are remembered in ways that demonstrate just how trapped they felt. I left it, as do so many Russians, knowing that this nightmare had really taken place and wondering what could be done to prevent it from recurring in Russia and elsewhere. What was my responsibility in all of this? \n",
      " That, of course, is the power of historic sites. Even in silence, they offer irrefutable evidence and raise questions that demand attention in the present. \n",
      " When we eradicate physical evidence of a widely shared memory, we risk suggesting that neither the events nor the people who lived them are worthy of inclusion in the historical record. Even more dangerous, by obliterating historical markers -- documents, artifacts and sites -- a society invites the twisting and denying of truth. \n",
      " Of course, in the short term, not everyone stands to gain by the presence of a historical marker. Saddam Hussein won't come out very well in any tour of a preserved Abu Ghraib. For that matter, neither will America, given its role in torturing Iraqis there more recently. That story, too, must be told and mined for lessons. \n",
      " Imagine if, instead of razing Abu Ghraib, Iraqis transformed it from an instrument of control and silence into an instrument of democracy and open discussion. Iraqis of every age and stripe could gather at the former prison to contemplate, as people do at the Terezin Memorial in the Czech Republic, the mystery of what turns one person into a perpetrator, another into a victim or a quiet bystander or a resister. \n",
      " Iraq will stand a better chance of transforming itself into a democratic state if it embraces historic restoration and interpretation. Abu Ghraib prison is a good place to start. But the enterprise should not end there. \n",
      " Around the world, curators of historic sites are realizing the role they can play in building democracy. In establishing the International Coalition of Historic Sites of Conscience in 1999, museum directors from Argentina, Bangladesh, the Czech Republic, England, Russia, Senegal, South Africa and the United States, including myself, wrote, \"It is the obligation of historic sites to assist the public in drawing connections between the history of our site and its contemporary implications.\" We saw \"promoting humanitarian and democratic values as a primary function.\" By preserving and interpreting Abu Ghraib prison, Iraq and the United States will improve their chances of fashioning a future in which both can take pride. \n",

      " The Clinton administration has compiled an admirable record on the issue of cigarette smoking and the regulation of tobacco for the harmful and addictive substance it plainly is. It has been tough where other administrations mostly looked the other way -- and the toughness has helped put the industry on the run. The last thing the president should do is jeopardize this accomplishment by entering prematurely into talks with the industry, which seeks a deal. But that is what the White House continues to give the impression it is doing. \n",
      " White House aide Bruce Lindsey is playing a part in the talks. The White House says it's not an active part -- that he's not, for example, advising the parties as to what terms the administration would and would not support -- but is just being kept abreast. Even that may lend a greater legitimacy to the process than is wise. It is not at all clear that the sort of deal the companies seek is in the public interest. The threats they face are litigation -- all manner of plaintiffs, including state governments, suing for damages both for the harm done by smoking and the industry's efforts over the years to cover up the harmful effects -- and regulation. The industry wants limits put on both, in return for which it would pay who knows how much -- perhaps a third of a trillion dollars over 25 years -- into a fund to be used for compensation. \n",
      " The talks right now are between the companies and a group of state attorneys general who have filed suits to recover Medicaid and other health care costs attributable to smoking. Just about any provisional agreement they might reach, particularly as to limits on future financial liability, would have to be submitted to Congress to be written into law. Why should the administration be weighing in now to help shape such a proposal, and what are Mr. Lindsey's credentials for doing so? He is said to be the president's closest adviser, but so far as we know he knows nothing of public health, which is or ought to be the paramount issue. \n"

A federal court agreed it had the power to do so the other day, though the decision will likely be appealed. The president should otherwise keep his distance and keep up the pressure at the same time-say he'll settle for nothing less than what fully protects the public health and leave it at that. Above all, the liability issue seems to us to be one the White House shouldn't be mucking around in-not at this stage, at any rate. A killer industry suddenly decides it wants protection.

      " As was the case when he arrived Monday, raising money also was very much on Dean's agenda. After he left the \"Tonight Show\" set, he was the star attraction at a fund-raiser with wealthy entertainment figures in an exclusive West Los Angeles neighborhood. Dean's campaign would not disclose the host for the event. \n",
      " Tuesday night, he was expected to announce at a rally at Union Station in downtown Los Angeles that his campaign had received more than $15 million in contributions since July 1. That amount was expected to far surpass the donations to any of his Democratic opponents during the year's third quarter. \n",
      " Dean had kicked off his final dash for cash at the home of a supporter in the Mid-Wilshire district of Los Angeles Monday night. During the event, Dean linked up with more than 3,446 callers at similar gatherings across the country. \n",
      " That would make it the world's largest conference call, surpassing the 3,310 fans that linked up with a British pop group in 2000, as recorded by the Guinness Book of World Records. \n",

      " He then sped to Orange County to speak to a Democratic club in Costa Mesa before driving back to South Los Angeles for a question-and-answer session on urban policy with about 75 religious leaders, community activists and elected officials. \n",
      " From there, Dean headed for the makeup chair to prepare for his appearance with Leno, where he shared the stage with actress Catherine Zeta Jones and musician Lyle Lovett. \n",
      " From the television studios in Burbank, Dean rolled to a private dinner at the home of an entertainment executive in the Santa Monica Mountains. His official schedule ended at Union Station, where he stood bleary-eyed before a giant tote board to announce his fund-raising total. \n",
      " Throughout the visit, the crowds were small but enthusiastic. \n",
      " Dean repeatedly stressed that he planned to win the White House with the support of voters who had previously been turned off by past campaigns. \n",

      "Pop star Michael Jackson, already facing multiple charges of child molestation, learned Friday that the criminal case against him includes a new felony count alleging that he and others conspired to commit child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion. \n",
      " Jackson pleaded not guilty to all the charges during short, subdued courtroom proceedings here that bore little resemblance to the raucous show that he helped orchestrate when he was first arraigned in January. \n",
      " He did not arrive late to court this time -- he came early, wearing a dark jacket, red tie and studious glasses. And afterward, he did not dance atop his black sport utility vehicle to delight the horde of young fans pressing against chain-link fences and proclaiming his innocence. Instead, Jackson emerged from court with only a few brief waves and a few kind words for Santa Maria, where jurors will be selected when his trial begins late this year or early 2005. \n",
      " \"I want you to know that I love the community of Santa Maria very much,\" Jackson said shortly before his motorcade left the courthouse. \"It's my community. I love the people. I will always love the people.\" \n",
      " Inside the courtroom, which was packed with his family members and fans, the entertainer sat upright and still and hardly uttered a word for nearly 40 minutes as Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Rodney Melville outlined a previously secret grand jury indictment against him. It supersedes the criminal charges that District Attorney Tom Sneddon filed late last year, and on which Jackson was arraigned in January. \n",
      " Prosecutors had planned to hold a preliminary hearing, in which they would have had to lay out the grounds for their case in open court. Instead, over the past few weeks they brought witnesses before a grand jury to obtain an indictment. \n",
      " Jackson, 45, who is free on $3 million bond and has surrendered his passport, now faces 10 felony charges. If convicted on all the counts, he could be sentenced to more than 20 years in prison. The charges include allegations that Jackson committed lewd acts against a child under 14, attempted to commit lewd acts, administered intoxicating agents to a child under 14 and committed 28 \"overt acts\" of conspiracy relating to the case. \n",
      " The portions of the grand jury indictment that were made public Friday deleted the names of alleged co-conspirators. None have been arrested. \n",
      " Jackson's alleged victim also has not been named. He is a former cancer patient who apparently met the star during his treatment and later appeared beside him in a British documentary filmed at Neverland Ranch, Jackson's sprawling estate near here. \n",
      " The boy, who was invited to sleepovers at Jackson's ranch, was among the witnesses who testified to the grand jury. Prosecutors contend that the criminal acts took place in February and March 2003. \n",
      " Friday's court proceeding, which drew media from around the world, capped a tumultuous week in which Jackson removed the two high-profile lawyers who had been handling his case, Mark Geragos and Benjamin Brafman, and replaced them with another who is a veteran of celebrity trials, Thomas Mesereau Jr. \n",
      " Jackson also appears to be distancing himself from the Nation of Islam, whose members had provided security for him in recent months. No members of the group accompanied Jackson on Friday. \n",
      " Melville has barred prosecutors and Jackson's defense team from discussing the case, but Mesereau spoke briefly to reporters after the court proceedings. \"This case is about one thing only,\" he said. \"It's about the dignity, the integrity, the decency, the honor, the charity, the innocence and the complete vindication of a wonderful human being named Michael Jackson.\" \n",
      " Nearly all details and documents of the criminal case against Jackson remain under seal by Melville, pending a hearing scheduled for late May. Attorneys for a coalition of media companies are urging the judge to release the affidavits and evidence used to support a search warrant for Neverland Ranch. Melville said Friday that he prefers to keep much of the case under wraps for now to protect the alleged victim and to ensure Jackson gets an impartial jury. \n",
      " Jackson decided Friday to waive his right to a speedy trial until at least September, although it appears that his lawyers want even longer to prepare their defense. \n",
      " The broad conspiracy charge could make that task more complicated. Before Melville imposed a gag order on both sides in the case, some Jackson representatives had previewed one of his probable defenses, suggesting repeatedly that the alleged victim and his family are opportunists preying on the star's riches. \n",
      " Also, prosecutors could buttress their case against Jackson by getting alleged co-conspirators to testify against him. \n",
      " Stan Goldman, a criminal-law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said it is difficult to determine exactly what the conspiracy charge means because few details were made public. While common in the federal courts, conspiracy charges are rarely brought in California criminal cases, he said. \"Some of the counts are so serious, one has to wonder why they were not charged separately,\" Goldman said, referring to the 28 overt acts cited as part of the conspiracy charge. \"Maybe they believe they've got enough evidence to charge him with the not-often-used conspiracy charges, but they may not have enough to charge him with the underlying charges.\" \n",
      " Goldman, who attended the arraignment, said he was struck by the obvious change in Jackson's demeanor and appearance since his last court date in January. \"If it was not outright stoic, it was definitely toned down and calmed down,\" he said. \"Maybe reality has finally struck him that he could actually be convicted of these charges and spend many years in prison.\" \n",
      " Hundreds of screaming fans came to catch a glimpse of Jackson at the courthouse Friday, but this time they gathered amid tight security. Scores of Santa Maria police officers and Santa Barbara County sheriff's deputies lined the sidewalks outside the courthouse, and spectators were not allowed past a six-foot fence that stretched for more than a block. \n",
      " That limited, but did not stop, the frenzy. For hours, as media helicopters swirled overhead, Jackson fans leaned shoulder-to-shoulder against the buckling fence, chanting \"Innocent!\" Others climbed trees and waved signs that said \"Leave Him Alone.\" The Jackson camp also assembled two busloads of supporters as part of what it called a \"Keep the Faith\" caravan from Los Angeles, about 160 miles away. Jackson treated them to a pizza party in Santa Maria Friday afternoon. \n",
      " As Jackson left the court, walking under a black umbrella, a few faces in the crowd looked on with scorn, holding signs that said \"What if it was your kid?\" But many more shrieked and wept when he came into view. \n",
      " \"I love you,\" one teen-ager screamed from the top of the fence as Jackson and his entourage drove away. \"You're still the king.\" \n"

      "A bill making California the first state to outlaw purchases of goods produced in slave-labor camps in China and other foreign nations was signed into law late Monday by Gov. Pete Wilson. \n",
      " The anti-slave labor bill -- actively supported by human rights activist Harry Wu, who spent 19 years as a political prisoner in Chinese labor camps -- is regarded by its backers as largely a symbolic breakthrough but also a potential economic weapon. \n",
      " Although it applies solely to state government purchases, the law is intended to build economic pressure against exploitative foreign factories in such countries as India, Pakistan and Brazil, as well as China. It also is expected to galvanize existing efforts to pass similar statutes in such states as New York and Massachusetts. \n",
      " Wilson, who kept the law's backers in doubt for weeks as to whether he would sign or veto the measure, issued a news release Monday night saying that, \"Unfortunately, the practice of forced, slave or convict labor is not uncommon in our world. ... These violations of humanity will not be tolerated. If you do business with a company that uses child or slave labor, you will not do business with the State of California.\" \n",
      " The bill's principal author, Assemblywoman Liz Figueroa, of Fremont, represents the Milpitas district where Wu, a naturalized U.S. citizen, now lives. Figueroa said she felt it was important for the state to express its support for Wu's human rights' campaign and to protect California workers from unfair competition from cheap goods made in slave labor camps. \n",
      " But a spokesman at China's consulate in San Francisco, Wang Yusheng, has said that accusations that his nation exports products made by prisoners are \"groundless.\" \n",
      " \"China strictly prohibits the export of products made by prison labor,\" he said, by virtue of a longtime agreement with the United States. \n",
      " The anti-slavery bill, approved overwhelmingly by both the Assembly and Senate, would prohibit the state's purchase of foreign-produced equipment, supplies or any other materials made by \"convict, forced or indentured labor.\" Contractors that \"knew or should have known\" that goods furnished to California were produced by such labor could have their deals voided by the state. (Supporters of the law said they had no estimate of what fraction of the state's $4 billion annual purchasing budget is spent on goods produced in China or other foreign nations.) \n",
      " In addition, contractors could be barred from doing business with the state for up to 360 days and would face fines of $1,000 or up to 20 percent of the value of the goods provided. Public works contracts were excluded from the bill, to head off opposition from critics worried that minor violations would substantially drive up the cost of construction programs. \n",
      " The federal Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 already prohibits the import of goods produced by forced labor. But proponents of the California anti-slavery bill, known as AB 2457, say the Smoot-Hawley restriction generally goes unenforced and, even when it is applied, imposes comparatively light penalties. \n",

      "One year after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger vowed to make the state's youth prisons places where inmates receive \"a better chance to succeed in life,\" his administration on Wednesday released a court-mandated plan to carry out that vision, outlining a therapeutic approach that has proven successful elsewhere in the country. \n",
      " The long-awaited blueprint proposes cutting in half the number of youths housed together; changing how guards handle unruly wards; ensuring that all receive therapy; eliminating extended solitary confinement for misbehavior; and more carefully screening incoming juveniles so they are housed and treated according to their needs. \n",
      " It also suggests transferring California's 155 female wards into secure residential programs, and says reform will likely be impossible unless the state closes its \"decrepit\" youth lockups and opens new or renovated facilities that are state of the art. \n",
      " While supportive of the principles at the heart of the plan, lawyers, legislators and relatives of young offenders called it skimpy on details. They also lamented that neither the document, nor the officials unveiling it, mentioned how much the changes would cost and where money to accomplish the task would be found. \n",
      " \"I think the state worked hard on this plan, and I know their intentions are good,\" said Donald Specter of the Prison Law Office, the nonprofit firm that sued the state over its management of juvenile corrections. \"But there are too many unanswered questions for us to feel confident that we will eventually have a system that keeps kids safe and protects the public.\" \n",
      " Specter said he and other attorneys were so disappointed by the lack of specifics that they considered filing a motion seeking to hold state officials in contempt for violating a settlement agreement, reached last year, in which Schwarzenegger vowed reforms. \n",
      " Instead, Specter said, the lawyers struck an agreement late Wednesday requiring the state to hire by Jan. 3 six national juvenile justice experts.

      " The clash over the beleaguered youth system comes as Schwarzenegger faces intense heat in another corner of his massive corrections department -- a lack of progress on fixing profound problems with medical care for the state's 168,000 adult prisoners. \n",
      " On Monday, a federal judge overseeing that issue sternly warned the governor to get involved and get the problem fixed, urging him to pay for emergency reforms \"the same way you find the money to build a tent to smoke cigars\" outside his Capitol office. \n",
      " U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said he was \"taking the gloves off\" and would hold a hearing on a contempt motion shortly unless Schwarzenegger appoints someone with authority to overcome the \"no-can-do bureaucratic mind-set\" that has thwarted progress on adult inmate health care. \n",
      " Like prison health care, the question of how best to house and manage the state's youngest lawbreakers -- 3,149 wards ages 12 to 25 -- has dogged government officials for years. \n",
      " In settling the Prison Law Office suit that had challenged conditions, Schwarzenegger last year agreed to build a new model. But since then, critics say, progress has been painstakingly slow, and some question whether Schwarzenegger's sagging popularity has made him leery of making corrections a priority. \n",
      " \"It's a question of political courage, and it doesn't look like the governor has enough of it to close these terrible prisons and create a system that works,\" said Jakada Imani, field director for Books Not Bars, which represents relatives of many wards. \n",
      " A spokeswoman for Schwarzenegger, Julie Soderlund, said the governor remains \"fully committed to bringing necessary reform to California's juvenile justice system.\" \n",
      " And Bernard Warner, chief deputy secretary of juvenile justice, echoed that sentiment, noting that other states that shifted their youth prisons from a punitive to a rehabilitative model -- such as Missouri and Colorado -- took many years to accomplish the change. \n",
      " The plan was filed Wednesday in Alameda County Superior Court, as part of the lawsuit settlement. Funding will be specified in the governor's next budget, due in January. \n",
      " Warner, who was appointed by Schwarzenegger in August, said the plan would be phased in over five years. In the first 18 months, he said, the state would roll out a more refined screening process for incoming inmates, replacing the current method of categorizing them merely by gender, age and gang affiliation. \n"

      "The flight crew of a chartered Turkish airliner that crashed Feb. 6 off the coast of the Dominican Republic, killing 189 people, allowed the Boeing 757's airspeed to drop so low that the plane stalled and went into an 84-second dive into the Atlantic Ocean, an initial investigative report said Thursday. \n",
      " The report, based on a preliminary reading of on-board recorders recovered from the ocean bottom Wednesday, said that cockpit instruments told the crew that the plane's airspeed as it climbed after takeoff from a Dominican resort was more than sufficient -- 335 knots, or about 370 mph -- but that ground-based radar and other sources \"indicated a much lower airspeed.\" \n",
      " The one-page report, released by the National Transportation Safety Board in concert with Dominican authorities, offered no reason for the discrepancy between the cockpit instrument readings and the plane's actual airspeed. However, the circumstances raise the possibility of a malfunctioning external airspeed sensor. \n",
      " There were indications that the pilots knew before takeoff that they had problems with their airspeed indicators but elected to continue. The report said that \"there were discussions about airspeed indicators early during the takeoff ground run and again after takeoff,\" although it offered no details as to what was said. \n",
      " According to sources close to the investigation, however, the cockpit discussion began when the flight crew noticed that the captain's airspeed indicator was registering lower than the co-pilot's; then, as the aircraft gained altitude, the airspeed reading on the captain's panel climbed above the level of the co-pilot's. When the two indicators disagree, the pilots are supposed to activate a third to clarify the reading, but it was not known if they did so in this case. \n",
      " One problem that could cause a discrepancy in the two indicators is blockage of a sensor called a \"Pitot tube,\" a simple external projection from the aircraft that measures airspeed through expansion and contraction of an internal diaphragm. However, if the Pitot tube is blocked -- by ice or debris, perhaps -- it will still indicate increasing airspeed because of rising air pressure as the aircraft climbs. \n",
      " For this reason, pilots are instructed to activate a device before takeoff that heats the tube and keeps it from icing over; crashes on other types of aircraft have been caused by failure to heat the tube. \n",
      " The report said that flight controls, engines and thrust reversers on the 757 were functioning properly, according to preliminary data. \"Also, there is no indication of any unusual weather event or external forces acting on the aircraft,\" it said. \n",
      " The insufficient airspeed became apparent minutes after takeoff. \"While climbing through 7,300 feet, the sound of the stall-warning stickshaker was heard,\" the report said. \"The airplane stopped climbing and started descending. The stickshaker sound continued for about 84 seconds until the end of data. At the time the stickshaker activated, the recorded airspeed was about 335 knots. Data recorded from ground-based radar and other (recorder) data indicated a much lower airspeed.\" A stickshaker gives a pilot a warning that a plane is about to stall by violently vibrating the control column emitting a loud alarm. \n",
      " Aside from a Turkish flight and cabin crew, most of the victims were German tourists returning from a vacation in Puerto Plata aboard a plane owned by the Turkish airline Birgen Air, which had been leased to the Dominican airline Alas Transporte de Internacional. It was to have flown to Frankfurt and then to Berlin. \n",
      " Thursday's report was based on a preliminary reading of the plane's flight-data recorder and cockpit-voice recorder; both these \"black boxes\" were recovered Wednesday from about 7,600 feet of water by the U.S. Navy and flown to the safety board's laboratory here. \n",
      " The boxes, which were housed in the tail section of the 757, were located Feb. 15 by a Navy-chartered recovery vessel towing an acoustic locater system that could hear electronic \"pings\" that the boxes emit when submerged; a \"cable-towed underwater recovery vehicle\" later plucked the boxes from the ocean floor. Both systems are made by Oceaneering International Inc., of Upper Marlboro, Md. \n",
      " The cockpit-voice recorder tapes the last 30 minutes of cockpit sounds and conversation, while the flight data recorder on the 11-year-old aircraft was designed to register 72 different airplane movements, control-surface positions and instrument settings. \n",
      " This was only the second crash of a Boeing 757 in 13 years of production, and U.S. authorities were eager to recover the recorders in case the crash revealed some basic flaw that might be common to all 757s-694 of which have been built, with two-thirds of those flown by U.S. airlines. \n",

If all of the buses make it into the city, Nagin said, the Superdome could be cleared out by nightfall tonight. \n",

      " \"They need to see psychologically that this is real,\" Nagin said. \"They need to see that they are really moving. They need to see people getting on the bus. I want to start to create a sense of hope.\" \n",
      " That will be difficult. There is a local legend that sports teams that have called the Dome home have fared poorly because the facility, which broke ground in 1971, was built atop a cemetery. Perhaps, some said Wednesday, the curse is real. \n",

      "Foreign money is pouring into Japanese stocks again, convinced that the Japanese economy's four-year slide is over and that a robust corporate profit turnaround is imminent. \n",
      " Many foreign buyers also are betting on another, perhaps more important turnaround: a change in Japanese investors' gloomy view of their market, which has left most of them watching unimpressed on the sidelines as the gaijin (foreigners) snap up Japanese shares. \n",
      " The Nikkei-225 stock index has soared from 17,417.24 at year's end to 20,973.59 as of Tuesday, a 20.4 percent gain that makes the Tokyo market among the world's best this year. In recent days the Nikkei has been particularly strong, breaking above the 20,000 mark -- where it had been lodged since February -- to a nine-month high. \n",
      " Optimism about Japan is running high among many American portfolio managers. The bulls believe that the Japanese economy is finally bottoming and that Japan therefore offers an opportunity to buy stocks on the ground floor of a recovery. Any money manager who missed loading up on U.S. stocks for two years while the U.S. economy languished naturally doesn't want to make the same mistake twice. And those who played the U.S. market correctly are eager to repeat that success. \n",
      " Barton Biggs, global investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Co. and someone whose opinion carries substantial weight with institutional investors, recently told clients that \"the Japanese market is a buy right now.\" \n",
      " Biggs' case is that Japan's many ills -- including a floundering political system, collapsed corporate earnings, a strong yen and horrendous unrealized real estate loan losses at banks -- are already so well known to investors that they must be mostly discounted in the stock market. \n",
      " \"What isn't discounted is that Japan is still a huge, powerful economy with a formidable business class running world-class companies located in the center of the fastest growth area of the world,\" Biggs told clients in a May 11 report. \n",
      " Strictly by the numbers, Japan still looks problematic. Real economic growth, which was 4 percent in 1991, plunged to about 1.5 percent in 1992 and was a negative 0.1 percent last year. \n",
      " The problem last year was largely internal: Japan's wealthy consumers sharply reduced their spending as the country's major corporations launched unprecedented restructuring efforts (including layoffs and deep cuts in capital spending) to cope with weaker global demand for Japanese exports. \n",
      " In short, 1993 was the year in which corporate Japan finally bit the bullet and admitted that the glory days of the 1980s were gone for good. \n",
      " This year, Morgan Stanley expects only 0.7 percent real economic growth for Japan, far below expected U.S. growth and even below what still-suffering Europe should muster. \n",
      " But in 1995, the Japanese stock market's U.S. fans expect the restructuring payoff to begin. Merrill Lynch Co. is telling clients that Japanese corporate earnings could rocket 35 percent next year from this year's depressed levels. \n",
      " Morgan Stanley's Biggs expects that a combination of revived domestic demand and faster export growth will lead to 5 percent to 6 percent economic growth in Japan for 1995 and 1996. \"When that happens, profits should explode,\" Biggs contends. \"I guess that reported earnings per share in the industrial sectors could double in the first year of recovery.\" \n",
      " Even so, many investors would argue that Japanese stocks already reflect 1995 earnings gains, and more. After all, the Japanese market's price-to-earnings ratio is around 70 now, based on estimated 1994 earnings per share. Even cut in half, the Japanese P-E would be 35, still far above the 15 to 20 P-Es of most world markets. \n",
      " The bulls contend that the P-E argument isn't important, and not just because Japanese stocks have always sold for high P-Es. Adjust for accounting differences and look at real, cash earnings of Japanese companies versus cash earnings of American or European companies, and many Japanese stocks appear quite reasonable, says John Hickling, one of Boston-based Fidelity Investments' senior international managers. \n",
      " By Morgan Stanley's figuring, Japanese stocks now sell for 7.8 times estimated 1995 cash earnings, versus 8.3 times for U.S. stocks. \n",
      " Hickling, who manages Fidelity's Japan stock fund and Overseas stock fund, among others, says \"a lot of the (Japanese) stocks I own sell for less than 10 times 1994 cash flow,\" which is cheap if you consider how depressed earnings still will be this year, he says. \n",
      " \"I think the Japanese market looks terrific,\" Hickling says, and he's focused in particular on industrial giants such as Toyota. \"You just have to look at what they've done to their cost base\" to see rich future profit potential there, he says. \n",
      " William Stack, manager of the Lexington Global stock fund, also believes that Japan's leading industrial and export companies are poised for surprising turnarounds. \"One of my strongest investment convictions today is Japanese cyclical stocks,\" says Stack, whose fund owns issues such as Toyota and Honda Motor. \n",
      " Yet beyond the obvious potential pitfalls in the bullish case on Japan -- another dive in the economy, or a further steep strengthening of the already overvalued yen (which would hurt exports) -- there's one glaring market problem: The Japanese themselves aren't buying stock. \n",
      " Still traumatized by their four-year bear market, Japanese regard the latest market surge as the work of \"silly gaijin,\" says Jamie Rosenwald, whose Rosenwald Capital Management has long been active in Japan. \n",
      " Rosenwald will be in Japan next week, specifically to look for hints that cash-rich Japanese institutions are ready to begin trickling back into the stock market. If he can't find signs that that's ready to happen, he admits, he will have to reconsider his bullish view of the market. Rosenwald believes that if domestic investors join in, the Nikkei could hit 25,000 in a hurry. But without their participation -- and soon -- he says, \"this rally could fizzle real quickly.\": [2466, 2466, 2433]\n",

      " The federal minimum wage hasn't been raised in a decade. During that time, businesses have received $276 billion in tax cuts. Another $36 billion has been directed specifically toward small businesses. The administration boasts -- though its numbers are overstated -- that, for 2006, 25 million small-business owners will receive an average tax cut of $3,641. So why, you might wonder, are President Bush and Republican lawmakers insisting that even more tax cuts be lavished on small-business owners as the price for approving a $2.10 increase in the minimum wage, from $5.15 to $7.25 an hour, in three steps over two years? The measure on the verge of being passed by the Senate would direct another $8.3 billion in such tax cuts over 10 years to small businesses, supposedly to offset the costs of the wage hike. \n",
      " Without the tax breaks, the wage hike cannot pass the Senate's 60-vote hurdle for cloture, strategists on both sides insist. Meanwhile, the House version -- it passed 315 to 116, with 82 Republican votes in favor -- does not include tax breaks. \n",
      " If the tax breaks are warranted, they should be granted as part of a larger review of tax policy -- not as a ransom for raising the minimum wage, now at its lowest level, adjusted for inflation, in half a century. It's good that the Senate has found other tax changes to pay for the cuts, but with the Democrats' commitment to pay-as-you-go rules, those kinds of offsets are going to be harder and harder to find; these could be used for other, perhaps more worthy, causes than another business tax break. To the extent that small businesses need help, the cuts are poorly targeted. For example, one provision would increase from $5 million to $10 million the threshold for businesses to be permitted to use cash accounting; a business grossing more than $5 million hardly sounds like a mom-and-pop shop. \n"

That seems to me to be Washington, D.C.\" \n",
      " The tone was just as acrimonious on trade, the most consistent source of conflict between the pair in the last month. Edwards derided Kerry's contention that the two had no major differences on how to change U.S. trade policy. \n",
      " \"That's not true,\" Edwards said. \"We have a very different record on trade. But more importantly, my approach to trade is fundamentally different than his.\" \n",
      " Edwards then criticized Kerry's declaration that if elected, he would appoint a panel to conduct a 120-day review of all American trade deals. \n",
      " \"We know what's wrong with these trade agreements,\" Edwards said. \"They need to be changed. The president of the United States needs to be willing to change them.\" \n",
      " Kerry defended his review and then said he held \"exactly the same position\" as Edwards on future deals: that the United States should sign no \"trade agreement that does not also have labor and environment standards contained within it.\" \n",
      " \"John Edwards has been in the Senate for five years,\" Kerry charged. \"He's talked more in the last five weeks about trade than he has in the entire five years.\" \n",
      " Kerry added: \"The fact is that he didn't vote in the 1994 election when he had a chance to vote about trade. He didn't talk about it, against it, in his election in 1998 when he ran for the Senate.\" \n",
      " At times, the debate felt like an argument on a New York street corner where everyone tries to talk at once. Edwards, who has seemed virtually unflappable in almost all of the earlier debates, regularly appeared piqued at Kerry's responses. \n",
      " Kerry, while remaining cooler, sometimes reverted to the windy style that has plagued him periodically on the campaign trail. The front-runner also seemed annoyed that during the debate the questioners frequently interrupted the candidates after they had said only a few words. \n",
      " (Optional add end) \n",
      " On other subjects, the candidates criticized Bush's handling of the crisis in Haiti that led to Sunday's resignation by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \n",
      " While declaring that Aristide \"has made plenty of mistakes,\" Kerry charged that Bush \"contributed to the clash you have today\" by declaring he would not provide aid unless Aristide reached agreement with the rebels to share power. \n",
      " Sharpton, who had been planning to travel to Haiti to attempt mediation on Wednesday, said Bush \"almost set up a situation where Aristide had to fail\" by failing to provide aid. \n",
      " Edwards said the United States should contribute troops to a U.N. force to stabilize the country but insist on a \"political process ... that allows us to move toward a serious democratic election, so that the people of Haiti are satisfied with the result.\" \n",
      " Kerry responded forcefully to a question that noted the nonpartisan National Journal had recently judged his voting record to be the Senate's most liberal last year. Citing his support for deficit reduction in the 1980s and President Clinton's plan to hire 100,000 new police officers, Kerry asked: \"Does that make me a conservative?\" \n",
      " In that characterization, Kerry received support of a sort from Sharpton and Kucinich. Both said that from their perspective Kerry did not qualify as a liberal. \n",
      " \"I don't think so, because he voted for the war (with Iraq),\" Kucinich said. \n",

      "Charles Bronson, the taciturn actor who became an international action star in Europe in the late 1960s and achieved major box-office success in America in the mid-`70s as the vengeance-seeking vigilante in \"Death Wish,\" has died. He was 81. \n",
      " Bronson, who reportedly suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died Saturday of pneumonia at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \n",
      " Originally cast in small parts as ethnic heavies in the early 1950s, Bronson emerged a decade later as a strong supporting actor in a trio of hit films with ensemble casts: \"The Magnificent Seven,\" \"The Great Escape\" and \"The Dirty Dozen.\" \n",
      " With his strong, Slavic face and squinty eyes, Bronson lacked traditional movie star good looks. But the muscular actor projected a rugged individualism and a no-nonsense quality on screen that director John Huston once likened \"to a hand grenade with the pin pulled.\" \n",
      " Stardom, however, eluded Bronson until his late 40s when he went to Europe to co-star as Alain Delon's tough American soldier-of-fortune partner in the 1968 British-French-produced thriller \"Adieu l'Ami\" (\"Farewell Friend\"). The film became a major hit in France. \n",
      " Bronson followed it up the same year playing a mysterious drifter in the Sergio Leone Western \"Once Upon a Time in the West,\" which turned him into a top star in Europe. A string of other European-made films followed. \n",
      " The Italians called him \"Il Bruto\" -- the Ugly One. In France, where he had become the No. 1 box office draw, he was known as \"Le Sacre Monstre\" -- the Holy Monster. And in Spain, the rough-hewn Bronson was named No. 1 male sex symbol, edging out the charismatic bullfighter El Cordobes. \n",
      " By 1972, a Hollywood Foreign Press Association poll named Bronson the No. 1 box office attraction outside of the United States. \n",
      " The same year marked the release of \"The Valachi Papers,\" an Italian-made film in which Bronson plays Mafia informer Joseph Valachi. It was the actor's first major success starring in a movie aimed at U.S. audiences. \n",
      " But the breakout role that established his box office appeal in the United States did not come until \"Death Wish\" in 1974. \n",
      " In the film -- a revenge fantasy deemed morally abhorrent by many -- Bronson played a Manhattan design consultant whose wife is murdered and whose daughter is brutally raped by a trio of muggers who invade their apartment. Bronson's mild-mannered character takes the law into his own hands by using himself as bait to lure muggers and then killing them with a hidden gun. \n",
      " Charles Champlin, then the Los Angeles Times movie critic, blasted \"Death Wish\" for being a \"despicable motion picture which seems certain to make a lot of money.\" \n",
      " Indeed, audiences around the United States often applauded and cheered whenever Bronson let one of the film's menacing thugs have it. \n",
      " \"Death Wish\" spawned four far-less successful sequels over the next 20 years. But in the wake of starring in one of the biggest-grossing films of 1974, Bronson was firmly established as a star in his own country. \n",
      " (Begin optional trim) \n",
      " In 1974, Michael Winner, the British director of Bronson in \"Death Wish,\" \"The Mechanic\" and \"The Stone Killer,\" offered his view of the middle-aged actor's on-screen appeal to The New York Times. \n",
      " \"The key to Bronson is the repressed fury, the constant feeling that if you don't watch the screen every minute, you'll miss the eruption,\" he said. \"But coupled with the intense masculine dynamism, there's also a great tenderness in Bronson. Women respond sexually to that combination of danger and tenderness in him.\" \n",
      " As for Bronson? \n",
      " \"Don't ask me to explain a mystique,\" he told The New York Times in 1974. \"I'm just enjoying all this while it lasts. I'm basically doing the same thing I was doing 20 years ago.\" \n",
      " (End optional trim) \n",
      " Among the actor's later films are \"Hard Times,\" \"Breakout,\" \"St. Ives,\" \"From Noon Till Three,\" \"Death Hunt,\" \"Telefon,\" \"Love and Bullets\" and \"Murphy's Law,\" as well as TV movies, including \"Raid on Entebbe\" and \"Act of Vengeance.\" \n",
      " Although his late-blooming stardom allowed him to buy a 33-room mansion in Los Angeles as well as a large farm in Vermont, the one-time Pennsylvania coal miner never lost sight of his roots. His acting idol was Wallace Beery because, Bronson said, \"his face showed the hard times.\" \n",
      " Born Charles Buchinsky on Nov. 3, 1921, Bronson was the son of a Lithuanian immigrant coal miner and an American-born Slav mother. \n",
      " The 11th in a family of 15 children, he grew up Scooptown, a tough section of the Pennsylvania coal-mining town of Ehrenfield. Scooptown was the kind of place where, Bronson once recalled, \"you had nothing to lose because you'd already lost it all.\" \n",
      " Bronson was 10 when his father died. The boy joined his brothers in the coal mines at 16, working the night shift while continuing to go to school during the day and earning $1 for every ton of coal he dug. If working on his knees and breathing coal dust in a subterranean world of darkness weren't enough, he grew even tougher with frequent fist fights. For fun, he'd hop freight trains. \n",
      " Drafted into the Army in 1943, he drove a mess truck in Arizona before serving as a B-29 tail gunner in the Pacific. \n",
      " After his discharge, Bronson moved to Philadelphia, where he enrolled in an art school on the GI Bill and held down a succession of odd jobs. While working out in a gym, he met members of the local Plays and Players theater group, who invited him to work on scenery. He soon found he preferred acting, progressing from walk-ons to speaking parts. \n",
      " When the theater closed for the summer of 1947, he found work renting deck chairs on the Atlantic City boardwalk before working on an amusement pier, where he met co-worker and aspiring actor Jack Klugman. He and Klugman later shared a room while trying to land acting jobs in New York City. \n",
      " Bronson moved to Los Angeles in 1949, where he enrolled at the nearby Pasadena Playhouse, bent on improving his diction. \n",
      " By then, he told Newsweek in 1972, \"I was already identified as a character (actor) by my ridiculous speech. ... At that time all the leading men were Cary Grant types. ... I didn't look or sound like the guy who got the girl.\" \n",
      " Within less than a year at the Pasadena Playhouse, Bronson made his movie debut: a small role as a sailor who boxes in an inter-ship tournament in Henry Hathaway's \"You're in the Navy Now,\" a 1951 World War II naval comic melodrama starring Gary Cooper. \n",
      " From bit parts, he progressed to more substantial roles, including a part in the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn comedy \"Pat and Mike\" and as Vincent Price's mad assistant, Igor, in the 3-D horror film \"The House of Wax.\" \n",
      " \"Drum Beat,\" a 1954 Alan Ladd Western in which Bronson is the leader of a renegade group of Indians, marked the first time he was credited as \"Charles Bronson\"; he is said to have changed his last name because of the unpopularity of Slavic names during the McCarthy era. \n",
      " In 1957, Bronson, who also worked extensively on television in the `50s, began playing leads in a number of B movies. The most successful was Roger Corman's \"Machine Gun Kelly,\" a 1958 gangster film that earned Bronson favorable reviews and became a minor sensation in Europe. \n",
      " The same year, he starred in an ABC-TV dramatic series, \"Man With a Camera,\" in which he played a former World War II combat photographer working as a freelance photographer. But the series was canceled after 26 episodes. \n",
      " A role in director John Sturges' 1959 war film \"Never So Few,\" starring Frank Sinatra, led Sturges to cast Bronson in two of his most memorable screen roles: as one of the seven hired guns who defend a Mexican village in \"The Magnificent Seven\" and as the claustrophobic \"Tunnel King\" in \"The Great Escape.\" \n",
      " But, despite the great popularity of both films, neither role proved to be a breakout to stardom for Bronson. In 1963, the same year \"The Great Escape\" hit theaters, he was back on television, playing a semi-regular role in the ABC Western series, \"The Travels of Jamie McPheeters.\" \n",
      " Before heading to Europe in 1968, he appeared in \"Four for Texas,\" \"The Battle of the Bulge,\" \"The Sandpiper\" and \"This Property Is Condemned.\" \n",
      " Bronson married actress Jill Ireland in 1968. \n",
      " She appeared in 11 films with her husband, and they remained married until her death to cancer in 1990 at age 54. \n",

      "The dueling visions of Michael Jackson could not have been more different. \n",
      " In his opening statement at the pop icon's child molestation trial Monday, Santa Barbara County District Attorney Tom Sneddon described Jackson as a man who surfed Internet porn sites with a 13-year-old cancer patient, treated him to wine and vodka, then seduced him. Later, Sneddon said, Jackson or his employees made death threats against the boy and his family, held them at the singer's Neverland ranch against their will, locked them out of their apartment and schemed to fly the entire family to Brazil. \n",
      " \"Why would any adult give alcohol to a cancer survivor with just one kidney?\" Sneddon asked. \"The answer is rather apparent.\" \n",
      " But Thomas A. Mesereau Jr., Jackson's lead attorney, described the entertainer as more prey than predator. In his opening statement, he denied that any sexual contact had occurred. Mesereau painted Jackson as generous to a fault, while casting the boy and his mother as con artists cruising Hollywood for celebrities to bilk, even keeping a ratty east Los Angeles studio apartment just to display their professed poverty. \n",
      " \"These charges are fictitious, bogus, and they never happened,\" Mesereau told the jury. \n",
      " In 2000, Jay Leno fielded a phone call from the boy in which the comedian could hear the boy's mother clearly in the background, Mesereau said. Leno said something was so fishy that he later told Santa Barbara police about the call. Boy and mother were \"looking for a mark,\" the attorney said. \n",
      " At the beginning of Monday's hearing, Santa Barbara County Superior Court Judge Rodney S. Melville read the sealed indictment against Jackson. Previously made public only in heavily edited form, the indictment lists 28 \"overt acts\" in February and March 2003 that, according to prosecutors, constitute a conspiracy to silence Jackson's alleged victim and his family. \n",
      " Addressing the jury from a podium for two hours and 42 minutes, Sneddon completed his opening statement. Mesereau spoke for 90 minutes and will probably finish Tuesday morning, before the prosecution calls its first witness, expected to be British TV journalist Martin Bashir. \n",
      " Jackson, in a dark suit with a gold starburst medallion and red armband, peered at the attorneys and the jurors through wire-rim glasses. Unlike previous hearings he has attended, only two relatives -- his brother Jermaine and his mother Katherine -- were on hand. Two dozen fans chanted outside when Jackson arrived and left. \n",
      " Sneddon cast Jackson as a man who wished to be an adolescent, who entertained the boy and his younger brother at his Neverland Valley Ranch with such antics as a \"cussing contest\" and simulating sex with a mannequin. \n",
      " But he also portrayed Jackson as a predator who surfed Internet porn sites with the boys and insisted on trying to \"teach\" them to masturbate. \n",
      " One night at Neverland, Jackson paraded before the boys \"absolutely stark naked and with an erection\" as they were watching TV, Sneddon said. \n",
      " \"It's natural,\" the singer explained, according to Sneddon. \"It's OK. Why don't you boys do the same thing?\" \n",
      " Disgusted, the boys left the room, Sneddon said. \n",
      " Eventually, Jackson had sexual contact with the older boy a number of times, Sneddon said. The two didn't know it, but the boy's younger brother witnessed the acts twice, Sneddon told the jury, adding that the younger brother is expected to testify. \n",
      " Now a 225-pound high school football player, the younger brother was walking up the stairway to the second floor of Jackson's two-story bedroom suite when \"he was frozen by what he saw,\" Sneddon said. \n",
      " The district attorney, a father of nine, graphically described a scene of Jackson allegedly masturbating as he kept his hand inside the underwear of the teenager, who was curled up and apparently sleeping or passed out. Wine and vodka bottles as well as empty glasses were on a night table, Sneddon said. \n",
      " The younger brother told no one about what he saw until months later, when a family lawyer steered the two boys to a psychologist, the prosecutor said. It was the psychologist who alerted authorities to the possible molestation. \n",
      " Jackson met the young cancer patient in 2000, as the boy was in remission from an illness believed by his doctors to be terminal. A veteran of \"comedy camp\" at the Laugh Factory club in Hollywood, the boy had asked as a last wish to meet a number of stars, including Jackson. \n",
      " After several telephone conversations between the boy in his hospital bed and Jackson at Neverland, the big day arrived. Days after leaving the hospital where hehis spleen, a number of lymph nodes, one of his kidneys and a 16-pound abdominal tumor were removed, the boy, his brother, and his father were whisked by limousine to Jackson's ranch. \n",
      " On that first visit, Sneddon said, Jackson and his aide Frank Tyson, treated them to a half-hour exploration of Internet porn sites on a computer in the star's two-story bedroom suite. \n",
      " Two of Jackson's children, Prince Michael, then 5 years old, and Paris, then 2, were sleeping on his bed at the time. According to Sneddon, Jackson leaned over and told his sleeping son that he was missing the show, using a vulgar word for female private parts. \n",
      " After the boys had numerous overnight visits to Neverland, Sneddon said, Jackson stopped calling. Still extremely ill, the young cancer patient didn't see the star in much of 2001. But he was happy to return to the Disneyland-like getaway in September 2002 to be interviewed by Martin Bashir, the British broadcaster. \n",
      " It was Bashir's documentary, \"Living With Michael Jackson,\" that triggered a worldwide uproar when Jackson admitted a fondness for non-sexual sleepovers with young boys. In the piece, Jackson is seen holding hands with the boy, who laid his head on one of the star's shoulders. \n",
      " While nothing sexual had yet occurred between the two, Sneddon said, it was crucial to Jackson and his advisers that the family publicly lavish praise him. \n",
      " That realization marked the start of an alleged conspiracy to secure the family's help. To control the mother, Sneddon said, Jackson's aides shuttled the family to an aborted news conference in Miami, brought them back to Neverland, and essentially held them captive. While the boy and his brother were sleeping in Jackson's bedroom and getting drunk with him in his wine cellar, the mother and an older sister were kept in their Neverland cottages and could leave only when heavily guarded, Sneddon said. \n",
      " Fearful of retaliation, the mother had her children say glowing things about Jackson on a so-called rebuttal video, which ultimately was broadcast on the Fox Network. She also gave Jackson high grades as a caring, non-threatening friend when Los Angeles social workers came calling. But even with those concessions, Jackson's aides insisted on keeping the boys at Neverland, Sneddon said. \n",
      " They closed the family apartment and withdrew the children from school, Sneddon said. To keep the older brother's alcohol consumption secret, a Jackson employee dumped a urine sample the boy needed for a kidney checkup. \n",
      " It was also at that time -- February 2003 -- that Jackson had his first alleged sexual encounter with the boy. \n",
      " Sneddon portrayed the mother as protective of her children, but also as someone who had \"made some mistakes,\" like lying in a lawsuit deposition. \n",
      " Mesereau, on the other hand, blasted her as a conniving grifter. \n",
      " Mesereau claimed the woman, who was married at 16 and had three children by the time she was 21, was adept at concocting sob stories about her poverty and her son's illness. He said she got Los Angeles police to donate to her family and hit up a Los Angeles comedian for $20,000. \n",
      " Others, like Leno, were put off by the woman, he said: \"They smelled the ruse.\" But, he added, Jackson, who is known for contributing to children's charities and opening up Neverland to groups of underprivileged kids, did not. \n",
      " Jackson sincerely wanted to help the boy, Mesereau said. He even tried teaching him a visualization technique he had read about for shrinking tumors. \n",
      " \"He took a lot of time from his career, never knowing the trap that was being set,\" Mesereau told the jury. \n",
      " Jackson -- and other prospective donors to the family -- also didn't know about the $152,000 settlement the mother had achieved in a lawsuit against the J.C. Penney chain, Mesereau said. Claiming that she had been \"falsely imprisoned\" by security guards after an accusation of shoplifting, the woman amended her complaint a year later to include allegations that guards in the parking lot had \"squeezed her nipples 10 to 20 times, molested her in the vaginal area, and called her racial slurs,\" Mesereau said. \n",
      " She later admitted lying in that case, he said. \n",
      " The attorney ran down a list of other incidents in which the woman was allegedly involved, saying the case against Jackson is \"her third claim of false imprisonment and her fourth of sexual assault.\" \n"

      "Jackie McLean, the internationally known jazz alto saxophonist, composer and educator whose life and career had a positive impact on countless youngsters and numerous proteges, died Friday at his home in Hartford after a long illness. He was 74. \n",
      " McLean's jazz reputation was based on his distinctive, brilliant, emotionally moving alto saxophone playing and creative composing.He was ranked among the top players in jazz history as an alto saxophonist and was a star in Japan. \n",
      " In Hartford -- the New York City native's adopted home since 1970 -- McLean became known for his jazz program at the University of Hartford's Hartt School of music. A pioneer in bringing full recognition to jazz as a legitimate academic pursuit, he established jazz studies as a degree program and founded the Jackie McLean Institute of Jazz at the music school. \n",
      " In the early 1970s, McLean and his wife, Dollie, founded the innovative Artists Collective, an African American cultural and teaching center in Hartford's North End. \n",
      " The program has under Dollie McLean's stewardship grown into a nationally recognized program, even a role model for other nonprofits serving community youth. \n",
      " \"Jackie left us very quietly and very peacefully at home, surrounded by his wife and children,\" Dollie McLean said. \"He gave so much in his life that he's still very much in our spirits and always will be.\" \n",
      " Born in New York City, McLean grew up in the Sugar Hill section of Harlem, where jazz seemed to be everywhere. As a youngster, he would recall fondly in later years, he visited bebop pianist Bud Powell in his apartment and listened to the master play. Some thought Powell was reclusive, but young McLean, a charming, modest kid, became a lifetime friend. \n",
      " A wunderkind sensation himself, McLean worked with his friend Sonny Rollins in 1948-49 and in the early 1950s worked with Miles Davis. When he was still a teenager, McLean made his first recordings with Davis. Later he was the alto saxophonist of choice for such jazz legends as Art Blakey, whom he viewed as one of his great teachers, and Charles Mingus. \n",
      " \"Every time you play,\" he once said, \"you've got to play your best and give everything you have as if it were your last solo.\" \n",
      " After his apprenticeship with Davis, Blakey and Mingus, McLean created waves with his own ensembles, particularly in the 1960s with a much-celebrated series of innovative recordings for Blue Note Records. \n",
      " Early in his career, McLean became the protege of Charlie \"Bird\" Parker. \n",
      " Unfortunately, McLean picked up on not only his mentor's musical skill, but also his addiction to heroin. Parker and a whole litany of bebop musicians died from the drug. After years of struggle, McLean became one of the few great jazz players of his generation to beat the addiction. Without Dollie's support, he acknowledged, he could not have done it. \n",
      " McLean not only beat heroin, but also reinvented himself in Hartford as a teacher and social activist out to improve the lot of city kids. Simultaneously, he sustained a musical career that included recording sessions and national and world tours, including frequent trips to Japan, where he enjoyed superstar status. \n",
      " On one Japan jaunt, he was walking along a street in Yokohama when he spotted a small nightclub with a big sign proclaiming it to be \"The Jackie McLean Coffeehouse.\" Much to his amusement, he later jammed in that small shrine to himself whose walls were lined with virtually every recording he had ever made \n",
      " As a teacher, he went out of his way to develop talent in young players and rooted for and supported his many proteges even long after they left Hartford. His \"Jackie MacLegion\" of proteges who have gone on to success includes Steve Davis, Sue Terry and Jimmy Greene. \n",
      " \"He was like a musical father to me,\" said Davis, who has gone on to become an established trombonist. \"I don't play a solo without thinking of Jackie McLean. He used his charisma and his talent to help so many in the school and in the community. He was a giant.\" \n",

      "Under a far-reaching reform to be announced Tuesday, all staff scientists at the National Institutes of Health will be banned from accepting any consulting fees or other income from drug companies, and the employees must also divest industry stock holdings, officials said. \n",
      " The new regulations -- drawn up by administrators from the NIH, the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Health and Human Services -- are aimed at halting lucrative deals that have led to conflict of interest probes at the government's premier agency for medical research. \n",
      " The changes exceed the partial and temporary curbs on outside income proposed earlier by the NIH director, Dr. Elias A. Zerhouni. Although the new rules could be reassessed after one year, officials familiar with the matter said they viewed the changes as permanent. \n",
      " For the last decade, government scientists at NIH have quietly been allowed to consult for biomedical companies under policies that defenders have said helped attract talented personnel to the agency. Hundreds of scientists took millions of dollars in fees and stock from industry. Most of the payments were hidden from public view, raising questions about the scientists' impartiality in overseeing clinical trials and in making recommendations to doctors for treating patients. \n",
      " In some cases, NIH scientists worked for drug companies that directly benefited from their recommendations to doctors. In other cases, scientists appeared at public forums and commented upon or endorsed treatments or drugs without revealing that they were on the payroll of companies making the products. \n",
      " The Los Angeles Times in 2003 and 2004 revealed the existence of the deals -- along with the secret policy changes that made them possible. Zerhouni appointed a blue ribbon panel last year to examine the NIH's policies, and congressional leaders, citing the Times articles, asked him to provide details on all biomedical industry payments to agency scientists for a five-year period. Four congressional hearings into conflict of interest at the NIH were convened last year, three in the House and one in the Senate. \n",
      " Full details of the new and restrictive rules were held tightly on Monday by NIH officials. Those familiar with the changes, speaking on a condition of anonymity, provided these particulars: \n",
      " All NIH scientists will be prohibited from accepting consulting fees, speaking fees and any other form of income from all biomedical companies, professional societies and other outside entities. The scientists must sell or otherwise dispose of any stock or stock options they hold in individual pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms. \n",
      " On the other hand, the government employees will be allowed to accept paid outside positions as physicians at hospitals or in other clinical settings. They also will be allowed to accept fees in some circumstances from universities for teaching or writing and editing services. The number of NIH employees required to file annual financial-disclosure reports open to public inspection under the Freedom of Information Act also is to be expanded. \n",
      " Two members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, whose leaders sought the documents about drug company payments to NIH scientists, praised the new rules. \n",
      " \"NIH's ethics requirements were appallingly lax -- not at all what the public would expect from our nation's premiere research institution,\" said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. \n",
      " In a written statement, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.) lauded the Times reporting and said \"we need to restore integrity and trust in NIH. I am glad NIH recognizes it has a problem and is now beginning to address these issues.\" \n",
      " Word of the new rules also drew applause from other present and former officials. \n",
      " \"It's a very, very salutary move,\" said Dr. Philip R. Lee, who served presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Bill Clinton as assistant secretary of Health. \"It returns NIH to where it should be in terms of the public's confidence that the people who work for NIH are working for them, and not for some drug company or some biotech company.\" \n",
      " Last month a deputy director of the NIH, Dr. Raynard S. Kington, said in an agency newsletter that investigations of potential conflicts of interest among agency employees were under way. Kington told the newsletter that \"fairly soon, we'll enter the penalty phase of these investigations. ... Some employees have substantially violated rules and regulations.\" \n",
      " The Times reported on Friday that, according to officials familiar with the matter, the inspector general's office at the Department of Health and Human Services was investigating an Alzheimer's disease researcher at the NIH, Dr. P. Trey Sunderland III. Records showed that from 1998 through 2003, Sunderland accepted $508,050 in consulting and speaking fees from Pfizer Inc. -- without seeking permission or reporting the income to the agency as required. \n",
      " Over the last year Zerhouni had insisted that any employee who violated the existing conflict-of-interest rules would be held to account. But the NIH director also said repeatedly that he wanted most agency scientists to remain at liberty to moonlight for the companies because that would help \"translate\" scientific discoveries from NIH laboratories into useful medical products. However, no evidence of any such translations was presented throughout the congressional hearings, or during sessions convened by the blue ribbon panel. \n",
      " Rigorous case-by-case screenings of ongoing or proposed moonlighting deals, Zerhouni said, would adequately safeguard against conflicts of interest. He appointed an ethics advisory committee last year to do just that, joining other agency efforts that NIH administrators said would \"manage\" conflicts of interest. \n",
      " The Times reported in December 2004 that one of Zerhouni's appointees to the ethics advisory committee, Dr. Harvey G. Klein, the top blood-transfusion expert at the NIH, accepted income from companies whose activities overlapped with his area of expertise. \n",
      " The article, based on government and company records and interviews, reported that Klein from 1999 to last year accepted $240,200 in consulting fees plus 76,000 stock options from five companies active in marketing or developing blood-related products. \n",
      " Klein said that other officials at the NIH approved all of his outside arrangements. \n",
      " Zerhouni within the past year made several attempts to contain the controversy over the drug-industry payments. \n",
      " He first proposed to ban outside paid consulting for top-level NIH leaders -- while allowing most of the agency's 5,000 or more other scientists to enter into such deals. In September, he proposed a one-year, NIH-wide \"moratorium\" on paid consulting, but it was never implemented. \n"

      "The following editorial appeared in Saturday's Washington Post: \n",
      " To hear it from officials at the Bush White House, disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff was someone they scarcely could have picked out of a lineup. \"Well, Abramoff is someone who we don't know a lot about,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, who served as White House political director, said back in January after Abramoff's guilty plea. Press secretary Scott McClellan said Abramoff had only been at the White House for some holiday parties and \"a few staff-level meetings\" -- about what, or with whom, the White House wouldn't say. \n",
      " But a new report by the House Government Reform Committee, based on three years of e-mails and billing records from Abramoff's former law firm, shows Abramoff and his colleagues billing their clients for 485 lobbying contacts with White House officials. Abramoff dispensed coveted tickets to sporting events and concerts. Adviser Karl Rove got skybox seats during the NCAA tournament, though he may have paid for them. \"He's a great guy. Told me anytime we need something just let him know through Susan,\" Abramoff wrote in a postgame e-mail, referring to his former assistant, Susan Ralston, who had gone to work for Rove. \n",
      " The records, as the committee aptly notes, offer \"an unusually detailed glimpse into a sordid subculture of fraud and attempted influence peddling.\" When the Mississippi Band of the Choctaw, an Abramoff client, was having difficulty getting $16 million in Justice Department funding to build a jail, the Abramoff team, according to the e-mail messages, turned to Mehlman to overrule the agency. Tony Rudy, the former Tom DeLay aide working with Abramoff, wrote in an e-mail that he planned to go to Mehlman \"with the list of the dollars they (the Choctaw) give.\" Mehlman, Rudy then reported to Abramoff, \"said he would `take care of this.' He was a rock star.\" \n",
      " The White House, responding to the report, pointed out -- correctly -- that Abramoff, an admitted felon, has a history of puffing up his contacts and padding his bills. It's not by any means clear that all of the reported meetings occurred or that the nearly $25,000 in reported meals and drinks with White House aides actually took place or that the aides didn't pay their share. But the White House complaint is more than a little hard to take, given its repeated refusals to provide information about its dealings with Abramoff. If there's information contradicting the lobbyists' e-mails, let's see it. \n",
      " Whatever happened between Abramoff and the White House, the report underscores the need for improved disclosure of lobbyists' contacts not just with members of Congress, but with the executive branch as well. In fact, the House Government Reform Committee approved a measure that would have achieved just that: All political appointees and senior officials in federal agencies and the White House would have to report their contacts with private parties trying to influence official action. The reports, filed quarterly, would list the dates of meetings, the parties involved and the subject matter. It's a great idea, and the committee approved it, 32 to 0, back in April. House leaders refused to add the measure to their anemic lobbying reform bill or even to permit it to be offered as an amendment on the floor.: [3517, 3480, 3395]\n",

      " This has become a landmark month in China's ongoing crackdown on free expression and peaceful dissent. Less than two weeks ago we wrote about the trial of Hong Kong journalist Ching Cheong on patently bogus charges of espionage. Mr. Ching hasn't been sentenced yet, but last Friday another journalist, Zhao Yan, was given a term of three years on fraud charges. A day earlier, one of the country's bravest human rights lawyers, Chen Guangcheng, was sentenced to four years. A week before that, another prominent lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, was abducted without a warrant by security forces; he was later reported to be detained for unspecified \"criminal activities.\" \n",
      " These cases follow a predictable pattern. Journalists and lawyers are abruptly arrested and held incommunicado for months, or longer: Mr. Zhao has been in jail since late 2004. Eventually their \"trials\" are staged in a matter of hours in closed courts. Mr. Chen's proceeding lasted two hours, and his own lawyers were not present -- one had been arrested the day before. Chinese media are banned from reporting on either the trials or the sentences. \n",
      " The charges in these cases tend to be fluid. Mr. Zhao, a researcher for The New York Times, was originally accused of revealing state secrets; authorities were annoyed with a Times scoop on a change of jobs by former President Jiang Zemin. When that charge proved impossible to substantiate, the fraud rap appeared. Mr. Chen angered local officials in Shandong province by revealing an illegal campaign of forced abortions. When central government investigators confirmed that his allegations were correct, the self-schooled lawyer -- who is blind -- was charged with organizing a mob and blocking traffic. \n",
      " It's not that the world doesn't notice these cases. President Bush himself lobbied for Mr. Zhao. But the government of Hu Jintao isn't listening. As international lawyer Jerome Cohen told The Post's Maureen Fan, \"the Communist Party has decided to thumb its nose at the world.\" That's a strange policy for a regime that hopes to host the world at the Olympic Games just two years from now -- and it's something that democratic governments ought to start talking more about.: [3372, 3341, 3261]\n",

      " Barack Obama recently reiterated his campaign promise to order up a plan for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq. But the Iraqi parliament has beaten him to it. Its ratification Thursday of a new bilateral military agreement with the United States not only establishes a timetable for the redeployment of American troops but delimits the missions they can undertake between now and the end of 2011. Mr. Obama has always said that his strategy was aimed at forcing Iraqi leaders to take responsibility for their country and its security. In adopting and ratifying the accord, the government and parliament have taken a major step toward that goal. \n",
      " By now Mr. Obama and most other opponents of the military surge launched by President Bush nearly two years ago have acknowledged its success in greatly reducing violence around Iraq. The completion of the Status of Forces Agreement and the accompanying strategic partnership accord with the United States shows how far the political system also has come. Two years ago, Mr. Bush's national security adviser wrote a memo questioning whether Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki was able or even willing to assert his authority. But Mr. Maliki has been both skillful and forceful in extracting concessions from the Bush administration -- such as the 2011 withdrawal date -- and winning agreement from Sunni as well as Shiite and Kurdish legislators. \n",
      " That those politicians were willing to publicly support three more years of American troops in Iraq just weeks before a hotly contested provincial election was another sign that the new democratic system is gaining its footing. Legislators gave themselves an out by requiring a national referendum next year that could allow Iraqi voters to advance the American withdrawal date by a year. But that flinch is less significant than the willingness of the government and parliament to stand up to pressure from Iran, which lobbied heavily against the Iraqi-U.S. accord, as well as to the domestic opposition of the Sadr movement. \n"

      " The Bush administration worked patiently and tirelessly to negotiate the new agreement, which will have the effect of removing Iraq from United Nations supervision on Jan. 1. Having all but destroyed his presidency through mismanagement of the war, Mr. Bush can now fairly argue as he leaves office that his successor will inherit an Iraqi mission that has been stabilized both militarily and politically. That's not the same thing as the \"victory\" Mr. Bush has often spoken of; Iraq could still unravel if its leaders or the Obama administration act unwisely. There is now, however, a workable road map for winding down the U.S. troop presence in the country and for consolidating the new political system. Mr. Obama will receive this framework from the president and the Iraqi government he has spent the last two years campaigning against. Though we don't expect him to say so, Mr. Obama is fortunate that he was wrong, both about the surge and about the capacity of Iraq's leaders.: [2912, 2864, 2818]\n",

      "Billionaire Philip Anschutz announced Tuesday that he was retiring from the boards of three companies in which he is the largest shareholder: Union Pacific Corp., Regal Entertainment Group and Qwest Communications International Inc. \n",
      " Anschutz, an influential developer in downtown Los Angeles and an increasingly active player in entertainment, is stepping aside at a time when the pressures and demands on directors of public corporations have intensified after a wave of accounting scandals. Qwest itself, the Denver-based telecom company Anschutz founded, was among the businesses targeted in federal probes, though he was not implicated in any wrongdoing. \n",
      " Tuesday's move \"will allow Mr. Anschutz to devote more time and attention to his privately held investments -- something he has desired to do for the past several years,\" Anschutz spokesman Jim Monaghan said in a statement. \n",
      " Anschutz, 66, will have no trouble keeping busy. \n",
      " Ranked by Forbes magazine as the 28th-richest American, with a net worth of $7.2 billion, Anschutz has investments in about 100 businesses. He earned his fortune in the oil and gas industry and remains active in energy exploration. \n",
      " His Anschutz Entertainment Group owns Staples Center, the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and nearly 30 percent of the marquee basketball franchise Los Angeles Lakers. The company is spending more than $1 billion to construct a convention center hotel and commercial project around Staples and $1 billion to build an entertainment district in London. \n",
      " Anschutz's Clarity Media Group owns the San Francisco Examiner and the Washington Examiner and will begin publishing the Baltimore Examiner in April. The company owns the rights to the Examiner name in more than 60 cities, including Los Angeles. \n",
      " His motion picture company made \"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,\" which has collected nearly $300 million in U.S. box-office receipts. \n",
      " \"Narnia\" helped Regal Entertainment recover from a midyear box-office slump by boosting the company's fourth-quarter profit 43 percent. Through a series of acquisitions, Anschutz built the Knoxville, Tenn., company into the nation's largest operator of movie theaters. \n",
      " The longtime Denver resident fiercely guards his privacy. He rarely grants on-the-record media interviews and seldom allows himself to be photographed. The last time Anschutz gave a news conference was more than a decade ago during a failed bid to build a convention center in downtown Denver. \n",
      " He founded Qwest on a plan to build a nationwide fiber optic network for Internet communications along the Southern Pacific Railroad lines, which he acquired in 1988. But the company's stock crashed after the number of fiber optic lines outpaced customer demand. \n",
      " Anschutz cashed in about $2 billion, or about 20 percent, of his Qwest holdings. The SEC investigated the timing and circumstances of the 2001 stock sales but found no wrongdoing. Seven former Qwest executives have been charged since 2003 in a federal probe. \n",
      " Anschutz joined the board of Omaha, Neb.-based Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad, in 1996, when it bought Southern Pacific. \n",
      " He \"was an active, engaged director whom I valued deeply as a sounding board for advice on many of the issues Union Pacific has faced over the years,\" Union Pacific Chairman Dick Davidson said in a statement. \"We will miss his insight, his enthusiasm and his judgment.\" \n",

      " Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva overcame some formidable negatives to win re-election as Brazil's president on Sunday, including a squalid series of corruption scandals and a lackluster record of growth during the past four years by Latin America's largest economy. But the reasons for his victory are mostly positive. The former metalworker and union leader, universally known simply as Lula, has been able to mobilize millions of Brazil's poor, who previously were largely excluded from the country's developing economy and democracy. Many of those people have seen tangible improvement in their lives thanks to Lula's policies, which have lifted some 8 million people out of poverty in a country of 185 million. \n",
      " Lula's achievements have come without the populist trappings, irresponsible fiscal policies or erosion of democracy seen in other Latin American countries -- most notably, neighboring Venezuela. Brazil's often precarious finances are in better shape today than four years ago. International Monetary Fund loans have been paid off, inflation is a mere 4 percent and the country has $60 billion in foreign reserves. Poverty reduction has come about largely because of an innovative program under which the government provides poor families with a monthly cash subsidy if they meet certain requirements, such as sending their children to school and having them vaccinated. \n",
      " With four more years to work with, Lula's challenge will be finding ways to tackle the big problem he failed to address: Brazil's sluggish growth. Redistribution of wealth is important in one of the world's most economically unequal societies, but Brazil can't prosper when it is growing at a rate below 3 percent, or less than half the rate of other emerging economies. Economists in and outside Brazil largely agree about what is needed: reductions in the sprawling state bureaucracy and runaway government spending, and in Latin America's highest taxes. \n",
      " Unfortunately, the president hasn't shown much inclination to tackle these tasks. During his runoff campaign against a centrist former state governor, Lula ranted against what he said was the danger that Brazilian state companies and banks would be privatized. In fact, such privatizations are needed, as are more steps to liberalize trade and encourage foreign investment. \n",
      " Lula campaigned against Brazil's foreign creditors four years ago, then surprised them by adopting orthodox fiscal policies after he took office. He would be wise to take the same course now and tackle the reform of the state, even while continuing programs for the poor. He has the opportunity to propel himself, and Brazil, into a position of leadership in Latin America by demonstrating how poverty can be addressed by sensible and sustainable policies rather than ruinous populism.: [3379, 3339, 3253]\n",

      " Last month, during a speech on race in Philadelphia, Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., repudiated \"in unequivocal terms\" the explosive sound bites from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., without denouncing him or repudiating their long relationship. In a confident address that discussed in an effective and intelligent way the impact of race on American life, Mr. Obama sought to put the rights and wrongs of the Rev. Wright into understandable historical context. \n",
      " This week was a different story. A downbeat Mr. Obama announced at a hastily convened news conference in North Carolina: \"The person I saw (Monday) was not the person that I met 20 years ago.\" Forcefully breaking from the Rev. Wright, Mr. Obama said: \"The insensitivity and the outrageousness of the statements shocked me and surprised me.\" He added that they contradict \"everything that I'm about and who I am.\" \n",
      " We didn't join the renewed and growing chorus calling on Mr. Obama to renounce the Rev. Wright after the minister's all-about-me rant at the National Press Club on Monday, but the candidate's motivation is pretty obvious. The Rev. Wright praised Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, said it was plausible that AIDS was a genocidal tool of the U.S. government to kill African Americans and proclaimed that attacks on him were an attack on the black church. He also delivered a deliberate poke in the eye to his former parishioner, suggesting that Mr. Obama's conciliatory Philadelphia speech was nothing but politics. With each defiant utterance Monday, the Rev. Wright dug a deeper political hole for Mr. Obama. \n",
      " Did Mr. Obama climb out of that hole this week? It seems to us that the whole sorry episode raises legitimate questions about his judgment. Given the long and close relationship between Mr. Obama and the Rev. Wright, voters will ask: How could Mr. Obama have been surprised by the Rev. Wright's views? How could he not have seen this coming? Mr. Obama didn't help matters much by initially seeming to dismiss the furor building over the Rev. Wright's Washington performance, just as he did with the initial uproar last month. At a media availability at an airport Monday afternoon, he displayed none of the anger and sorrow that etched his face in North Carolina one day later. \n"

An 18-year-old whose partially clothed body was found in a car trunk. \n",
      " These are among the blood-and-guts stories featured on NBC's \"Dateline\" in the past three months. \n",

      " Television news -- especially local television -- has always been drawn to crime. But in a country in which more than 16,000 murders were committed last year, are the killings of ordinary people, however tragic, really worth all this airtime? \n",
      " \"I think it lends itself to storytelling,\" says David Corvo, executive producer of \"Dateline.\" \"You've got a confrontation, right and wrong, guilt or innocence, and a resolution, and there's some suspense getting to that resolution.\" \n",
      " The tabloidization of these programs comes as the networks have fallen out of love with newsmagazines, which were crippled by overexposure. As recently as 1999, magazine shows served up a dozen hours a week. Over the years, \"Eye to Eye,\" \"Public Eye,\" \"Now,\" \"West 57th,\" \"60 Minutes II\" and others came and went. \"Dateline\" and \"48 Hours\" have largely been relegated to weekends. \n",
      " Among the other survivors, CBS's \"60 Minutes\" and ABC's \"20/20\" are still based on the original concept of a wide-ranging show that encompasses news, trend stories and lighter features. ABC's \"Primetime Live\" includes a number of murder stories but many other subjects as well. \n",
      " \"48 Hours\" specializes in older cases that it can follow through the court system: an Ohio husband found not guilty of his wife's murder after three trials. A reopened investigation that led to a conviction in the 1969 murder of a Michigan woman. The hunt for a serial killer in Australia. The killing of a Bellevue, Wash., couple in 1994. The 1995 murder of a policeman's wife. A Texas woman convicted of killing her husband in 2002. \n",
      " Zirinsky says she made the shift two years ago after ratings showed that \"the crime genre really kind of resonated\" with the audience. \"I make no apologies. We love doing it.\" \n",
      " At the suggestion of Les Moonves, CBS's chief executive, \"48 Hours\" dropped the idea of having an anchor and begins each program with the narrative, without so much as an introduction. \n",
      " Thanks to the rise of cable news, Zirinsky says, \"the audience no longer needs a potpourri magazine show. They're getting it in too many places.\" And with the growth of \"Survivor\"-type shows in recent years, \"reality television has bitten us in the rear.\" Zirinsky calls her program \"reality drama.\" \n",
      " Television analyst Andrew Tyndall, who dubs the crime sagas \"cliffhanger journalism,\" says newsmagazines proliferated because they were less expensive to produce than sitcoms or dramas -- but that was before the blossoming of reality shows. \"Journalists are cheaper than actors,\" he says. \"It turned out that real people are cheaper than journalists.\" \n",
      " \"Dateline\" breaks away from murder now and then. It has aired a Tom Brokaw segment on global warming, a piece on Bill Clinton and Bill and Melinda Gates fighting AIDS, and a Matt Lauer interview with Britney Spears. The program has also devoted considerable time to stings against sexual predators on the Internet, working closely with law enforcement in a controversial collaboration. \n",
      " Corvo says it may seem like the program does more crime because he has moved away from multiple subjects toward more single-topic hours. \"People like you to go deep, not broad,\" he says. \n",
      " But by and large, death dominates. Consider these opening lines from \"Dateline\" co-anchor Stone Phillips in recent weeks: \n",
      " \"A single gunshot and a man is dead, the killer disappearing into the night leaving behind a crying widow and a mystery.\" \n",
      " \"A savage murder in a wild landscape. The victim, a woman loved in her community, found dead deep in the woods of Alaska.\" \n",
      " \"It's a case with all the intrigue of 'The Da Vinci Code': A gruesome death at a famous landmark, links to a secret society, and a scandal surrounding the Vatican.\" \n",
      " When \"Dateline\" runs out of current cases, it exhumes those from the past, such as a segment on four children looking into the circumstances surrounding their mother's death in 1973. \n",
      " Both Corvo and Zirinsky say they have jumped on breaking news when necessary, as they did with Hurricane Katrina. Apparently, the war in the Middle East doesn't qualify. \n",
      " But while the programs might seem increasingly one-dimensional, the bottom line is still getting people in the tent. \n",
      " \"We are a commercial network,\" Zirinsky says. \"If nobody watches, I can be self-righteous right off the air.\" \n",
      " Ted Koppel, who once bragged about his refusal to use e-mail, will soon be getting a webcam in his home. \n",
      " To help publicize his new role creating documentaries and hosting town meetings for the Discovery Channel, Koppel will answer e-mail questions with video responses on the network's Web site. \n",
      " \"Ted is a self-described Luddite,\" says Tom Bettag, his longtime producer. \"He would always say, 'Don't tell me about this new media stuff; it's not my world.' \" \n",
      " But Koppel agreed to take the plunge after potential advertisers, including a major automaker, told him they needed an online outlet if they were going to support his programming, Bettag says. \n",
      " In a dry run with questions from Discovery staffers, the shirt-sleeve Koppel is more serious than chatty. He talks about whether America has ever been more divided (yes, in the McCarthy era), Kim Jong Il (\"controls the single most totalitarian regime in the world\") and the most under-covered parts of the globe (China and India). \n",
      " \"We thought the man who has done such a great job of interviewing would be a great person for other people to ask questions,\" says Don Baer, a Discovery senior executive vice president. \n",
      " In an e-mail response -- itself a major sign of progress -- Koppel said he was unaware of plans for the home webcam and confessed that his initial answers were provided the old-fashioned way: \"A camera person comes to my office and asks questions. Is that cheating?\" \n",
      " The online news audience is aging a bit. \n",

      " In a bizarre standoff with police, the woman suspected of shooting Selena locked herself inside a red pickup truck in the hotel parking lot for more than nine hours, threatening to commit suicide. As hundreds of Selena's fans swarmed the site, police tossed the woman a cellular phone and negotiated with her until she surrendered at about 9:35 p.m. local time. \n",
      " The suspect was identified by the slain star's father as Yolanda Saldivar, 32, who until recently had managed one of Selena's two clothing boutiques and had run the star's fan club. Saldivar and Selena had reportedly fallen out in a financial dispute; the singer's father said he suspected Saldivar of embezzling money. \n",

      "An arriving Asiana Airlines jumbo jet narrowly missed a departing Southwest Airlines flight at Los Angeles International Airport in August after a controller mix-up that apparently placed both planes on the same runway, federal authorities confirmed Tuesday. \n",
      " A captain aboard the Asiana Boeing 747-400, which was arriving from Inchon, South Korea, aborted the landing Aug. 19 and came within several hundred feet of a Southwest jet headed to Albuquerque, N.M., according to a report obtained by the Los Angeles Times. \n",
      " The incident eerily resembles a 1991 collision on the same runway, in which 33 people died after a controller cleared a USAir jet to land on a runway where a commuter plane was waiting to take off. \n",
      " That crash occurred at night, whereas last month's incident was at 2:55 p.m. in clear weather. \n",
      " Confirmation came the same day the Federal Aviation Administration held a news conference in Washington to announce that near collisions on the nation's runways are declining. At the event, officials said there had been no serious incidents involving commercial jets this year. An agency spokeswoman later explained that the LAX incident was still under investigation and had not been officially added to the statistics. \n",
      " Nationally, the FAA reported a 20 percent drop in all runway safety incidents in federal fiscal years 2000 through 2003, and serious near collisions declined by more than 50 percent. Serious incidents involving two jets declined even more markedly, from 15 in 2000 to two in 2003. \n",
      " In the Asiana incident, initial reports from the control tower at LAX estimated that the jet flew within 200 feet of the Southwest aircraft, but just how close the planes ever were to each other is still under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. \n",
      " \"It's still too damned close,\" said a high-ranking FAA official who requested anonymity. \n",
      " The incident is the closest call at the world's fifth-busiest airport in at least four years. The facility led the nation in near misses from 2000 to 2003, according to the FAA report released Tuesday. \n",
      " At LAX, controllers orchestrate a complex choreography involving nearly 2,000 landings and takeoffs a day. The airport has two sets of parallel runways, one on the north side and the other on the south side. \n",
      " The NTSB has obtained the black box recorders from the Southwest plane and has interviewed the captain and first officer. Investigators have requested a statement from the Asiana captain. \n",
      " They are also examining radar data and recordings from the tower, and interviews with the controllers are being scheduled. \n",
      " The incident was initially considered so serious that the FAA classified it as a \"Category A\" near miss, or a runway incident that requires \"extreme action to narrowly avoid a collision,\" but the incident will not be finally classified until after the NTSB investigation, sources said. \n",
      " Controllers at LAX blamed the near miss on antiquated radar systems and understaffing during a busy Friday-afternoon rush, when scores of jets approach the airport and controllers must use all four runways for arriving aircraft. Controllers typically use two inner runways for takeoffs and two outer runways for landings. \n",
      " \"Either way, what happened that day ... was not optimal for aviation safety,\" said Mike Foote, an air traffic controller at LAX. But Foote also noted that the ground radar \"functioned as advertised.\" \n",
      " That system, known as AMASS for Airport Movement Area Safety System, may become an issue in the investigation of the incident. The FAA has relied on the new ground radar, in place at LAX and several dozen other busy airports nationwide, to warn controllers when planes are on a collision course. \n",
      " But safety board experts, who favor a system in the cockpit that directly warns pilots, have questioned whether AMASS gives a timely warning. In computer simulations, some alerts have come only eight to 11 seconds before a collision would have occurred -- not enough time for controllers to figure out what is happening and warn pilots, and for pilots to then react. \n"

      "When I picked up my chef's knife the first time, its eight-inch blade seemed as scary as a machete. How could I use something that big without drawing blood? \n",
      " I was obviously a kitchen-knife neophyte. That was before I learned how to hold the chef's knife _ in ways I never thought a knife should be held _ and before I learned the all-important (but frankly awkward) \"claw,\" a way of tucking the fingertips of my other hand safely out of the way of a cutting blade. It was before I learned a lot of other things about my knives, too, things that can make a home cook perform more like a sophisticated chef. \n",
      " My transformation began when I went public with my intimidation. As I wrote last year in a Post Food section piece praising my six-inch steak knives, the chef's knife was part of a wedding-registry gift set that had been gathering dust in a block on my countertop because I hadn't a clue how to use it. Instead, I relied on those steak knives for just about all my slicing needs. After the article was published, the public-relations reps for Zwilling J.A. Henckels Corp. got in touch with an offer: Henckels' executive chef, Jeffrey Elliot, would give me a private tutorial. \n",
      " It's not that I don't know how to cook. I'm more than competent in the kitchen, and those steak knives are nimble to use and can cut anything from a shallot to a small roast. But I'm intrigued by the prospect of expanding my repertoire. After all, it's not easy to use a steak knife to cut a green pepper into julienne. \n",
      " Elliot spent five hours introducing me to the six primary knives in my standard set: the chef's knife, paring knife, bread knife, tomato knife, boning knife and utility knife. But I wasn't done: My interest was piqued, so I signed up for a three-hour knife-skills class with chef instructor Brian Patterson at L'Academie de Cuisine's Gaithersburg, Md., campus. \n",
      " It turns out that I'm not the only cook out there depending on steak knives, and both instructors seemed frustrated by that. Elliot complained that their serrated blades result in ragged-looking food, and Patterson said I'd get a lot more control with a chef's knife. I still love the steak knives, but Elliot and Patterson have persuaded me to use other implements, especially the chef's knife. \n",
      " Of course, my fear of the eight-inch knife was overblown and based on misconceptions. You are not supposed to use it to hack through food as if you are clearing brush. Instead, you keep the knife close to the cutting board and slice or chop with small movements in a tiny area, letting the breadth, weight and sharpness of the blade do the work. \n",
      " Patterson calls the chef's knife (also called a cook's knife) the workhorse of the kitchen. It's used for chopping, dicing, cutting food into matchstick-size pieces (julienne), mincing and, occasionally, other types of slicing. The blade can range in length from six to 14 inches. My chef's knife has a micro-serrated blade designed for beginners, and it occasionally got stuck in tougher vegetables. \n",
      " So I borrowed Elliot's straight-edge knife to learn what a chef's knife is capable of. I have to admit, his knife has advantages over my steak knife. With an awesome power, the knife requires just one guillotine-like stroke to complete a slice. And the sharpness of the blade makes it possible for me to make attractive, similar-size pieces, ensuring uniform cooking time. When I create thin slices of yellow squash or diced cubes of bell pepper, I beam as if I were a chef on one of those TV cooking shows. \n",
      " But the learning curve has been steep. The chef's knife is handled differently from other knives. I'm sure many experienced cooks know all this, but I was surprised when Elliot instructed me on how to hold it: to pinch the top of the blade between the thumb and the forefinger in front of the handle. I asked him (twice) if he was serious about touching the metal. He nodded yes. The other three fingers grasp the handle. \n",
      " The rule for securing the food with the other, guiding hand was another surprise. You bend the fingers in a claw shape, with \"nails down, knuckles forward,\" Patterson says. Elliot emphasizes that the nails are tucked under a little. Another weird encounter with the blade: Align it against the knuckles of the middle and index fingers of the guide hand to position and stabilize the knife. \n",
      " With the chef's knife, you don't use the back-and-forth sawing I'm used to with the steak knife. Instead, you move down and forward. Elliot says that most of the contact with the food is with the back third of the blade near the handle. And the tip of the blade should be touching the board when possible. In his class notes, Patterson writes, \"The front end of the blade acts as a pivot, a fulcrum, a hinge, grounding the knife to the cutting board, setting up a predictable plane of cutting. If the tip of the chef's knife is not anchored to the cutting board, it should be on its way to being anchored. ...\" \n",
      " For practice, I started by slicing celery stalks. Then Elliot showed me how to cut off a potato's ends and square off the other two sides by cutting them to be flat. I then sliced the potato lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick planks. I stacked the planks and cut them into batons, which, in turn, could be diced for hash browns. \n",
      " My set is the J.A. Henckels International Everedge Plus, for cooks unfamiliar with fancy sets. The knives, which are either micro-serrated or fully serrated, can't be sharpened but last about 15 years, Elliot says. Straight-edge knives are sharper but need to be maintained by using a honing steel before each use and professionally sharpened periodically. \n",
      " After the chef's knife, Elliot says, the most important and useful pieces of my set are the paring knife and the bread knife. Here's what I learned about them and the rest of the set: \n",
      " The paring knife looks like a miniature chef's knife. It's for peeling and carving fruit and vegetables, and it is occasionally drafted for chopping and dicing duty, Patterson says. Elliot taught me how to make pretty strawberry pieces with it. Cut a strawberry in half, lay one piece flat side down and place the knife's point below the stem and parallel to the long edge of the fruit. Slice thin segments across the strawberry, leaving the stem intact. Press down to make a fan. \n",
      " My bread and tomato knives are fully serrated, unlike the rest of the micro- serrated knives in my set. Full serration is best for cutting food that is hard on the outside with a soft interior, such as bread or fruit, without squishing it, Elliot says. Serrated knives are also good for cutting pastry, and vegetables such as artichokes or squash, according to Patterson. \n",
      " The tomato knife does make thinner, more attractive tomato slices than my steak knife. Elliot suggests using a paring knife to cut out the stem in a compact piece. For cutting a loaf of bread, Elliot told me to use as much of the length of my eight-inch bread-knife blade as possible to minimize the number of cuts, resulting in less shredding and effort. \n",
      " Boning knives, as the name would indicate, are for separating meat from bones. Elliot showed me a technique for creating a fish filet. Buy a whole fish with the guts removed. Position the knife behind the head and cut down until you reach the bone. Then turn the knife and use the blade tip to slice and lift the flesh along the spine from the head to tail. Then press the knife along the rib cage and cut away the remaining flesh opposite the spine. Turn the fish over and repeat. Removing the skin is tricky and something I plan to learn when I have had more practice. \n",
      " The utility knife is good for cutting cold cuts and cheese, anything that might go into a sandwich, Elliot says. I find myself grabbing the six-inch knife for many other slicing needs. It is, after all, the implement that most resembles my steak knife. \n",
      " The utility knife is familiar and reliable, like my old Volvo. The chef's knife is still as exotic to me as a Maserati. But my confidence in using it has grown, and I plan to invest in one with a straight-edge blade. Elliot recommends holding different chef's knives at stores to get a sense of how they feel in my hand, kind of a limited test drive. There are many to choose from: heftier European ones and lighter Asian designs, in so many sizes and shapes. Once I settle on the right one, where will it take me?: [1581, 1580, 1555]\n",

It's likely both disorders are caused by a common mechanism, they said. \n",
      " The study is the first to probe the connection between erectile dysfunction and restless legs syndrome, or RLS, two conditions that have been linked to abnormally low levels of dopamine, a chemical that relays signals in the brain. RLS, a brain disorder that afflicts about 10 percent of Americans, can cause problems falling or staying asleep, according to the Rochester, Minn.-based Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation. \n",

      "\"From Paris With Love\" (R, 95 minutes): Pierre Morel's film has as much to do with l'amour as, say, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. It's the story of trigger-happy CIA veteran Charlie Wax (John Travolta) and his unlikely junior partner James Reece (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a desk jockey who has always dreamed of ditching his cover job at the U.S. Embassy for a career in special ops. Too bad he's never fired a gun. No sooner has Charlie arrived in Paris than he takes James under his beefy wing -- the one that doesn't have a gun in it -- shooting up half the city in what he explains is a mission to take down a French-based drug cartel. In other words, it's a hyper-violent buddy comedy. If you like that sort of thing -- think \"Training Day,\" with laughs -- you'll love this. Contains nearly constant violence, pervasive obscenity, drug use and brief sexuality. DVD Extras: Commentary; featurettes; trivia game; theatrical trailer. \n",
      " \"Oceans\" (G, 87 minutes): This French-made Disney nature movie, originally released on Earth Day, is 87 minutes of gorgeous visuals of curious sea creatures set to soaring orchestral music. But for all it does to please the eyes and ears, it does nothing to engage the brain. The narrator, Pierce Brosnan, rarely tells viewers about the wildlife's mating rituals, hunting tricks or even which ocean they live in. There's neither a narrative arc nor organizing principles of any kind. It's not like the film starts in the Pacific and travels to the Indian or starts in shallow water and plunges deeper as it goes on. Instead, it flits from creature to creature with no transitions in between. Contains wildlife violence. \n",
      " \"Shutter Island\" (R, 138 minutes): This gothic thriller begins in 1954, when two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), arrive at the eponymous island just off Massachusetts, where looms the impenetrable Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. The marshals have been detailed to find a prisoner who has suddenly vanished from her locked cell. As a hurricane bears down on the island, Teddy and Chuck match wits with the hospital's chief physician, the brilliant Dr. Cawley, played with poker-faced elan by Ben Kingsley. Martin Scorsese creates a pastiche of moody atmosphere, stylized flashbacks and dream sequences and a devotion to flagrant violence that turns rancid and repulsive. And Scorsese's fascination with images of dead children -- drowned, bloodied, ashen-faced -- isn't sinister or scary or even creepy. It's just weird.

The two seem well on their way to being team rivals, but instead they become improbable friends. The somber Tosha visits Jesse at her architecturally pristine mansion, and Jesse makes her first sojourn to working- class Anacostia to take Tosha home. Writer-director Emily Abt's fiction debut evinces an alert sense of the economic and racial disparities in Washington, where privilege and powerlessness exist within such dizzying proximity.

      "Subscribers to Comcast's TV and Internet services have been getting a little something extra lately: access to a Web site that lets them watch many of the channels their bills cover. \n",
      " The site, called Fancast Xfinity TV (fancast.com), builds on an earlier version that left out premium channels. The Philadelphia-based carrier launched it in December and brought it to the Washington area last month. \n",
      " Fancast Xfinity is the most ambitious attempt yet to implement an idea called \"TV Everywhere.\" Under this concept, channels and providers work together to provide online access to shows and movies _ but only to people who already pay for conventional, offline viewing on televisions. (Verizon is testing a similar service called Fios TV Online.) \n",
      " That authentication requirement makes logging onto Fancast Xfinity a little more complicated than watching a sitcom on Hulu or one of the networks' own sites. In addition to subscribing to both Comcast's TV and Internet services, you also need to install a Comcast Access program _ which itself installs extra video and support software. \n",
      " Once you've entered the user name and password of your Comcast account _ I used a temporary one arranged by Comcast's public relations department because I don't subscribe to its services _ you authorize your computer for access to the site. You can also authorize two other computers at any time. \n",
      " This wasn't any particular trouble to set up on a Windows 7 laptop. On a Mac, however, I could use the site only in the Firefox browser _ for reasons unexplained in its system-requirements page, Fancast Xfinity doesn't work in Apple's Safari browser on the current version of Mac OS X without extra tweaking. \n",
      " Comcast touts an inventory of 19,000 TV shows and movies, but that impressive- sounding total falls well short of what its cable boxes can deliver. Sports are mostly out, but even among the comedy, drama and documentary offerings, you find strange gaps. For example, its HBO content is just as spotty as that channel's new HBO Go site, leaving out the likes of \"Entourage\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\" Its AMC selection excludes \"Mad Men,\" while Apple's iTunes Store sells entire seasons of that show. \n",
      " You can't blame those gaps on Comcast, though. Each network has to decide whether it wants to build an audience by giving viewers more ways to watch its work _ or whether it would rather stick with last decade's business model. \n",
      " You can, however, blame Fancast Xfinity's usability issues on Comcast. This site provides far fewer ways to manage your viewing interests than Hulu; you can't add shows to a queue or have the site add new episodes to that playlist automatically. It doesn't say whether particular titles are in high-definition or something less than that. And its lists of what's available are categorized sloppily. \"Slumdog Millionaire\" is filed under \"comedy,\" for instance. \n",
      " Picture quality varied wildly, even over a fast, 15 megabits-per-second Fios connection. A Food Network \"Throwdown With Bobby Flay\" show could have the look of a VHS recording; MTV's \"The Real World: D.C.\" came closer to standard- definition TV quality; an episode of \"The Wire\" looked better yet (but sometimes mysteriously slowed down); the first chapter of HBO's \"Band of Brothers\" came over in crisp high-definition that looked terrific even on a 40-inch HDTV (but I had to reboot the computer to get out of a cycle in which Comcast Access asked me to authorize the laptop for viewing, had me sign in again, then asked me to authorize the laptop for viewing again). \n",
      " Bear in mind that Fancast Xfinity is free to Comcast subscribers. And even with its quirks, it provides a convenient way to catch up on missed episodes, sample new shows and follow your favorite programs _ like a TiVo in the sky. \n",
      " In that respect, it's a far better way to breathe new value into a cable subscription than stuffing still more channels into a programming bundle. \n",
      " But what about people who don't subscribe to Comcast but might gladly pay less for online-only viewing? My experience suggests that's technically possible, but Comcast doesn't seem interested in poaching customers from competitors that way. Spokeswoman Kate Noel wrote, \"Right now we have no plans to offer this as a service separate from their television service.\" \n"

      "As I sit here, mostly still full from last week's turkey-and-trimmings marathon and yet nibbling on the last bit of my sons' Halloween candy stash, it occurs to me that 'tis the season for overindulgence, again. \n",
      " And I can't help but wonder what, exactly, the price of all of this holiday- season overeating is, year in and year out. Personally, it feels like I put on at least 10 pounds between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day, what with the extra sweets, stress and parties full of fattening festive foods and booze-soaked toasts, not to mention the cold weather providing even more disincentive than usual to exercise. \n",
      " So I was happily surprised to discover that, in reality, the average holiday weight gain is just under a pound, at least according to the classic research on the topic, which was published a decade ago in The New England Journal of Medicine. This NIH study, which followed 195 men and women ages 19 to 82 for up to a year, also found that less than 10 percent of participants gained more than five pounds during these six weeks. \n",
      " Still, the prognosis isn't great over the long haul: This research also showed that most weight gain over the course of a year occurs during the holiday quarter and, more important, that we typically don't shed the pounds we put on. \n",
      " \"It's definitely a bad cycle,\" says Robynne Chutkan, assistant professor of gastroenterology at Georgetown University Hospital, who specializes in diet and nutrition. \"People put on a pound or two over the holidays because it's cold and dark, and there's a lot of comfort food around, but then that New Year's resolution doesn't quite get off the ground, and [the extra weight] follows you into 2011.\" The result is that this minute weight gain might last a lifetime and simply continue to snowball. \"A pound or two a year times 10 years can and will add up to a major problem,\" she says. \n",
      " The heavier you are, the more difficult the holidays can be from a weight maintenance perspective. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that people who are already overweight or obese are significantly more likely to gain more weight during Yuletide, which Chutkan attributes to ingrained habits and behaviors, such as lack of self-control when it comes to food, or not enough physical activity. \n",
      " That finding is echoed in new research, published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine Research in August, which found that overweight or obese elementary-age children pack on significantly more pounds than their normal-weight peers during the holiday break. \n",
      " Heavier adults and kids are \"generally at higher risk during the holidays,\" agrees internist Lawrence Cheskin, director of the Johns Hopkins Weight Management Center in Baltimore, who adds that although thinner people are not immune to seasonal weight gain, they might compensate for it better by keeping track of the extra pounds and focusing on losing them in the new year. \n",
      " So what's the best way to stave off that weight gain? Chad Cook and colleagues at the University of Wisconsin have done research suggesting that it might not be exercise. Their study of 443 adults ages 40 to 60, presented at a recent meeting of the Obesity Society, found that even those people who habitually burn more daily calories than predicted for their age and body weight are not protected against holiday weight gain. Cook notes that 75 percent of participants gained at least some weight and nearly a fifth put on 4.4 pounds or more. \n",
      " Such results echo other research showing that although physical activity is important for mood and cardiovascular fitness, it is relatively inefficient at controlling body weight, says Cheskin. \"You can eat in 60 seconds what it would take you two hours at [the] gym to burn off,\" he explains. \n",
      " Other experts agree that it makes sense to focus on a healthful holiday diet and on keeping control over your caloric intake, even when you have images of sugarplum fairies - and Mom' s famous cheese dip - dancing in your head. \n",
      " It also helps to keep your your attention off the buffet table. \"Food is like 90 percent of the holidays . . . but there are so many other special things to focus on during this time of the year,\" says Chutkan, citing family members and friends and added leisure time. \"It's important to try to detach from all the meals and parties and treats a little bit so there's some holiday left that's not completely absorbed by food.\" \n",
      " But for those of us who just can't resist the kids' holiday cookies, it's also important to cut ourselves some slack, as long as we get right back on the wagon. \"If you do gain some weight in the next few months, it's okay. You don't have to beat yourself up about it,\" Chutkan says. \"But you do immediately have to take drastic measures to undo that.\": [1767, 1748, 1684]\n",

      " Belgium's parliament is so polarized along linguistic lines that it has been unable to agree on a government for much of the past three years. At the moment it is ruled by a caretaker coalition. But the deputies managed to achieve near- unanimity this week on one pressing issue: discriminating against Muslims. A law passed by the lower house would ban the wearing of full Islamic face veils in any public place _ and exacerbate what is becoming an ugly European trend. \n",
      " Like many of its neighbors, Belgium has a significant minority Muslim population _ about 3 percent of a population of 10 million. Like those neighbors, it has done a poor job of integrating Muslim immigrants, and many cluster in ghettos that can be breeding grounds for extremism. This is a serious and complex problem. But too often the response of governments has been bigotry directed at immigrants or Muslims as a whole _ which serves only to further alienate even non-devout members of the community. \n",
      " Belgium's burqa ban is a good example. The law prohibits any full facial covering, with a punishment for violators of a week in jail or a fine of up to $34. Some supporters claim it is an anti-crime measure, but its chief sponsor, Daniel Bacquelaine, hasn't hesitated to describe it as an act of cultural warfare. \"The burqa,\" he was quoted by Reuters as saying, \"is the affirmation of a number of values that are contrary to fundamental values and universal values.\" \n",
      " French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is promoting a similar ban in his country, is equally blunt: \"The burqa has no place in France,\" he has said. Fundamentalist Muslim rulers must have been pleased to hear those words: Paris will now have no cause for complaint when countries with Christian or Jewish minorities ban the nun's habit or the yarmulke. \n",
      " The anti-burqa cause is sweeping Europe. In addition to Belgium and France, Italy and the Netherlands are considering bans. Yet the targets of these measures are virtually nonexistent. Bacquelaine estimates that a couple of hundred women in Belgium wear a full veil. In France, one study estimated that there are 1,900 burqa wearers in a Muslim population of 5 million. \n",
      " The idea that this poses a criminal or cultural threat is ludicrous. Those who say they are defending women's rights have it exactly backward: They are violating fundamental rights to free expression and religious freedom. They are also exacerbating the very problem they say they are worried about. Muslims, including the devoutly religious, are in Europe to stay. Banning their customs, their clothing or their places of worship will not make them more European. It will only make Europe less free.: [2172, 2165, 2129]\n",

      " President Barack Obama was back in Michigan recently, breaking ground on a plant that will make batteries for the Volt, the plug-in hybrid electric car forthcoming from government-owned General Motors. The Energy Department paid half the factory's $300 million cost, using funds from a $2.4 billion advanced vehicle technology grant program in the president's economic stimulus plan. The administration says that this is a smart bet on the green economy of the future. Skeptics argue global production capacity for advanced batteries is already rapidly outstripping demand. Roland Berger Strategy Consultants predicts a job- destroying \"massive consolidation\" five years from now. \n",
      " We have a related concern: For the near future, electric cars will be far too expensive for anyone but upper-income Americans. The only way to sell them, even to the well-off, will be with a large federal subsidy. \n",
      " The average new car sold for $28,350 in 2008, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association. GM has just announced that the plug-in Volt, by contrast, will cost $41,000. Nissan's all-electric Leaf is projected at about $33,000. (Both vehicles are smaller, and, because they take hours to recharge, less versatile, than comparably priced gas-powered cars.) Tesla's Roadster costs more than $100,000, though the company has committed to building a $57,000 sedan. The advanced-vehicle business model makes sense only because of a $7,500 -per-car federal tax credit to the first 200,000 purchasers of each model. \n",
      " Even then, gas savings may or may not offset the higher total cost of owning an electric car, unless excise taxes go way up or fuel prices spike permanently. (A cap-and-trade bill might have changed the calculus, but it just died in Congress.) The cars also need an in-home charging station, which costs a couple of thousand more, after federal tax credits. \n",
      " Common sense suggests the likeliest purchasers will be upscale consumers who already own gas-powered cars for heavy-duty driving, live in a single-family home with an electric outlet in the garage _ and can afford a green experiment. Deloitte Consulting's interviews with industry experts and 2,000 potential buyers suggest that \"early adopters\" will come primarily from households making over $200,000 a year. \n",
      " To be sure, the Obama administration assumes that electrics, like cellphones before them, will swiftly move down-market as production ramps up and costs shrink. The whole point of the U.S. investment and purchase subsidies is to speed that process. Deloitte's study, however, suggests that, even with government aid, the electric-car demographic a decade hence will encompass only 1.3 million potential buyers, drawn from households making $114,000 per year and up. With sales reaching 465,000 by 2020, \"achieving profitability and manufacturing efficiencies will be a challenge,\" Deloitte concludes. \n"

      " In the new Henry Moore exhibition at Tate Britain in London a valiant attempt is made to remodel the celebrated sculptor's image. The show presents \"a Moore whose work is darker, edgier, and more complex than the familiar Moore ... we propose that he presents the body as abject, erotic, vulnerable and visceral,\" writes the curator Chris Stephens in the catalog. \n",
      " In other words, here's a Henry Moore (1898-1986) who was more like his younger contemporary Francis Bacon. I can see why the Tate is tempted to try this art- historical relaunch. Moore, so long taken for granted as the acceptable representative of a sedate, unchallenging modernism, seems ripe for a reassessment. I'm afraid I just don't buy this dark, erotic Henry. \n",
      " For a period, in postwar Britain and beyond, Moore's family groups and reclining figures proliferated in front of office buildings and in public housing projects. In recent decades, though, his reputation has sagged. Pressed to pick a great 20th- century British artist, most people would probably opt for Bacon. For younger artists and critics, Moore's art has lost its edge. \n",
      " The Tate show aims to put that edginess back. The problem is that -- on the evidence of what's on show -- it's far from clear that Henry ever had it. True, in his early days he was a bit of a rebellious modernist (at least in an English context). \n",
      " Pieces such as \"Reclining Figure\" (1929) draw on sources in what was then termed \"primitive\" art -- in this case that of ancient Mexico. But even when his sources are Aztec or Mayan, he homes in on the more calmly monumental side of those sometimes ferocious traditions. \n",
      " For real \"primitive\" fury and energy, Moore is nowhere near Picasso, or even the older Britain-based sculptor Jacob Epstein. As for eroticism, if that's really what you want in modernist casting and carving, take a look at Eric Gill. There's an impersonality about Moore's work -- his faces and heads are usually abstracted away to blob-shaped forms with pin-hole eyes -- that removes all sense of intensity. It's only when you get to \"visceral\" that I grant Tate may have a point. \n",
      " Moore really does seem to have been fascinated and inspired by the innards of things, bodies and landscapes. The energy level in the show shoots up when you get to the room of drawings of coalminers at work and Londoners sheltering in Underground stations during World War II. These are about people crouching in the entrails of the earth. \n",
      " That was Moore's great subject: the analogies, you might almost say the rhymes, between the human body and the curves, caves and crannies of hills. The other outstanding room at the show is the last, filled with reclining figures carved from elm wood. They are grand, even majestic, though scarcely sexy. They are about what people have in common with trees. \n",
      " The exhibition stops in the 1960s, omitting the last two decades of Moore's life. This gets over a problem: A lot of his work, especially the big, late pieces needs to be seen outdoors. It's there, especially at his old studio and home at Perry Green, Hertfordshire, that Moore's art looks most impressive. \n",
      " Was he a great artist? Possibly. I walked out of this show not quite sure about that. But dark, edgy and erotic, he wasn't. \n",

      " What is necessary, leading Democrats say mostly in private, are fresh personnel, policies and approaches; a midcourse correction, not a radical overhaul. \n",
      " The early signs aren't encouraging. Obama has tapped a deputy, Pete Rouse, to fill in for Rahm Emanuel, the departing White House chief of staff; the National Security adviser, General James Jones, is being replaced by his no. 2, Tom Donilon; and longtime Obama adviser Denis McDonough will fill Donilon's slot. \n",
      " They are very able. Rouse is one of those rare Washington insiders who practice the late General George Marshall's dictum that you can accomplish a great deal if you credit others. He is a stranger to self-promotion and has served Obama well in the Senate and White House. \n",
      " Yet these appointments convey a signal of promoting the junior varsity after the varsity has been shellacked. \n",
      " It isn't clear whether the president will reach out for new faces to fill the top levels: a corporate executive to address the complaints that this is an anti-business administration; someone with impeccable military credentials to assist and balance Donilon, viewed by Republicans and some in the armed services as a political operative; and somebody with acute political antennae outside the Obama stratosphere. \n",
      " In addition to expanding his inner circle, Obama has to be more approachable and outreaching on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, say Democratic politicians who want him to succeed. \n",
      " The president's problems are far more than public relations. Yet somehow this White House has to figure out why it's done such a poor job in explaining its policies. \n",
      " When Americans overwhelmingly believe that taxes have gone up, the economy is shrinking, that the Wall Street bank rescue won't be repaid and that the stimulus didn't create jobs -- all demonstrably false -- somebody hasn't been doing something right. As recently as September, a fatigued White House botched the issue of tax cuts, due to expire for all Americans at the end of the year. \n",
      " Noting his party has controlled Congress and the White House for two years, former Democratic Senator Paul Kirk of Massachusetts says: \"We've had the megaphone, and they stole the message. They've incited fear in people, and we're paying the price.\" \n",
      " On policies, it isn't about ideology. The left-wing rap is flawed: This administration rejected nationalizing banks and a public option on health care, and downsized automobile companies. Still, at this stage, presidencies -- whether Republican or Democratic, and even in the absence of an election debacle -- move to find more common ground with the other side. The first two years is about an agenda. That's when Republican administrations did tax cuts and military buildups. \n",
      " With Republicans likely to win a majority in the House and veto power in the Senate, the White House has to look for accord in areas like education, trade and minor energy matters. Any significant fiscal deal is probably out of reach. \n",
      " As Obama navigates these unfamiliar waters, he'll need to lean on Joe Biden. Despite occasional foot-in-the-mouth problems, the vice president has an intimate knowledge of the way Washington works and he commands respect, even affection, from more than a few Republicans. \n",
      " There's another invaluable potential ally: former president Bill Clinton, with whom Obama has a distant relationship. During the 2008 campaign, Emanuel, then an Illinois congressman, advised Obama to call Clinton periodically, even if he put the phone in the sock drawer. It's time to call, and stay on the line. \n",
      " There are differences between what Obama faces today and what Clinton confronted when Democrats lost their congressional majority 16 years ago -- the economy is far worse now, and Boehner may not be a convenient foil. \n",
      " Still, no one understands the office, the conditions and the politics better than the 42nd president, who, in another remarkable display of resilience, has bounced back from the 2008 doldrums to become the most popular politician in America. \n",
      " Clinton could tell Obama that a favorite storyline these days -- that he was saved from the 1994 election disaster by bringing in the consultant Dick Morris and making nice with Republicans -- is largely fiction. \n",
      " Clinton selectively cut deals with congressional Republicans, going along with a capital-gains tax cut and forging an accord on overhauling welfare. The stellar economic performance and balanced budget at the end of his presidency had little to do with those deals. \n"

      " The Census Bureau reported this week that the overall national child poverty rate is nearly 21 percent. Poverty rose last year in 31 states and fell in none. \n",
      " Children who grow up in poverty are more likely to be poor as adults. They lag behind early in intellectual development, tend to attend lower-quality schools and are more likely to drop out of high school. It's not surprising that poverty would rise during an economic downturn. But the current recession _ marked by increased levels of long-term unemployment and homelessness _ could have a particularly brutal and long-lasting effect on the children hit by it. \n",
      " Another troubling development revealed in the latest poverty statistics is the continuing increase in the number of households living in deep poverty, defined as half the poverty rate. This translates to a paltry $5,478 for an individual and $10,977 for a family of four. The nationwide census report on poverty, released this month, showed that the number of people in deep poverty hit a record high last year, accounting for 6.3 percent of the population _ or 44 percent of those living in poverty. \n",
      " The poverty level is an admittedly imperfect measure of households' economic status _ it does not reflect non-cash benefits, such as food stamps _ but the trends are worrying. The numbers underscore the critical importance of safety net programs. For example, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that although 3.7 million people fell into poverty in 2009, another 3.3 million people would have joined their ranks without the extension of unemployment benefits. Thursday marked the expiration of a program, launched as part of the stimulus package, that placed 250,000 low-income parents and teen-agers in private-sector jobs. The House approved a one-year, $2.5 billion extension, but it has been blocked in the Senate. It is sad that this successful effort could be allowed to lapse in the face of these sobering figures.: [1822, 1815, 1752]\n",

      "Q: I recently accepted a position at a company and have been working here for two weeks. I was unemployed a long time and really love this job. However, I am having an issue over the allotted vacation time. The company only grants two weeks vacation each year, and I long ago purchased a three-week family trip for this Christmas/New Year. I was aware of the conflict during the interview process, but did not mention it because I did not want it to impact my consideration for the job. Now that I have settled in, I am wondering when is the best time to bring up the issue? Should I do so immediately (to appear honest and forthcoming), or wait until I am more established in a few months (and have a better bargaining chip as a valued employee)? If it is any consolation, my husband only visits his family once every two years, and that is what this trip is for. He is more established at his company and has no problem taking the time off from work. \n",
      " A: The first issue is whether you will even have two weeks of vacation available to take come the holiday season. If you work for the typical company, then you earn vacation in equal increments each pay period. If you started around the beginning of August, then I calculate you will have accrued a little more than four days by the end of the calendar year. Unless your employer follows a policy of allowing employees to borrow against their annual vacation allotment, then you have a sizeable hurdle to surpass even before you reach the question of whether you will be allowed an extra week off. \n",
      " I will assume for purposes of my answer that your employer would allow you to draw upon the entire two weeks of vacation immediately, without having one entire year of service behind you. \n",
      " Even so, you have a second problem: You knew about this vacation when you were interviewed and you failed to disclose it. I understand your decision, and I think it was a sensible one. However, you are now in the awkward position of having to essentially admit you withheld a material piece of information about your availability. \n",
      " You could wait to ask for the time off and pretend that you planned the trip after you were hired. But an astute employer would be left to wonder if you are being honest. People usually make their holiday plans months in advance, especially when those plans involve rare and important family gatherings. Part of your argument for taking an additional week off, I assume, will be precisely that it is for such a momentous occasion. If so, that will be at odds with acting as if you recently came up with the idea. \n",
      " This brings me to the third problem: making a request to take all of your vacation at the same time when you are so new to your job. If I were your employer and you approached me with such a request so early in your tenure, I would immediately have misgivings about your commitment to the enterprise. \n",
      " I know this view is not entirely fair. After all, vacation is an important benefit that many people take into serious account when deciding on a job. A certain amount of unused vacation is carried over by most workers from year to year, and, in compliance with many state wage and hour laws, it is often paid out as cash when an employee departs. \n",
      " However, the reality is that, with rare exceptions, employers do not expect their employees to take all of their vacation at once and they frown upon vacations of more than two weeks. Lengthy absences from work can be disruptive to business operations and unfair to others who must cover the work of the absent employee. When someone is allowed to take two or more weeks of vacation in a row, therefore, it is usually a concession to a tenured and otherwise deserving employee. \n",
      " This rule is especially in force around the holidays, when so many people want to spend time with family. A request for two _ let alone three _ weeks off in December could be a problem for your company. \n",
      " I think your best chance of getting to go on your holiday vacation is to come clean immediately. Tell your supervisor about your plans and apologize for not speaking up sooner. Underscore that you are submitting your request now _ nearly five months in advance _ because this trip, for which you have already paid in full, is very important to your family. Acknowledge that this is a big request and offer to take the third week of your trip as unpaid time off. I think you should also express a willingness to shorten your vacation to two weeks if necessary, just to demonstrate that you are flexible and considerate of your teammates. \n",
      " I don't think you should delay your vacation request a moment longer, because you do not have enough time between now and December to earn claim to a three- week vacation. Moreover, you might be competing for time off with other people who cover your functional area. The longer you wait, the greater the hardship on the business, the more disingenuous you will look and the less likely that your wish will be granted. \n",

      " Haiti reported the highest number of deaths with 1,900 and 900 more missing and presumed dead from flooding and mudslides caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne in September. The eye of the storm did not hit land in Haiti, but Jeanne's rains soaked northwestern Haiti, unleashing floods and mudslides. \n",
      " \"This season has proved that it isn't always the wind that is the killer,\" said Richard Pasch, a hurricane specialist at the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami. \"Even if the storm's center does not directly pass over land, you can still get landslides and mudslides in the Caribbean.\" \n",
      " Other places in the Caribbean hit hard by storms this year included the Bahamas, Jamaica and the Cayman Islands. \"They will remember this year for a long time,\" Pasch said. \n",

      " Carhart said Wednesday he had not given up on opening a practice in Kansas where women can have a late-term procedure, even though he admitted his plans were in a state of flux given the rules passed late Tuesday night by the Kansas Legislature. \n",
      " Some people on the other side of the abortion debate aren't taking comfort in the fate of Roeder, 52, who was convicted in January of first-degree murder for fatally shooting Tiller last May as the doctor served as an usher in his Wichita church. The only question remaining Thursday is whether Roeder's imprisonment will include a mandatory minimum of 25 or 50 years behind bars. \n",
      " \"Mr. Roeder was a setback to the pro-life movement -- and to give him any sort of credit for reducing or stopping abortion is well beyond reason,\" said Troy Newman, president of Operation Rescue. \n",
      " Roeder's militant sympathizers disagree. \n",
      " \"He went ahead and laid down his life to save unborn children and to me that is the definition of a hero -- he gave up his life to save someone else,\" said the Rev. Don Spitz, of Virginia, who runs the Army of God Web site supporting violence against abortion providers. \n",
      " In Kansas, Tiller's killing has practically erased late-term procedures and forced women to Albuquerque, New Mexico and Boulder, Colorado, among other places, to have them. \n",
      " Just three clinics in the state -- all located in or near the Kansas City metro area -- offer limited abortion services for women up to their 21st week of pregnancy. \n",
      " \"People were coming from all over the world to have abortions in Kansas,\" said Kari Ann Rinker, a lobbyist for the National Organization for Women's Kansas chapter. \"Now they don't come here because Dr. Tiller has been killed.\" \n",
      " Beyond the state, however, abortion rights advocates say doctors are increasingly offering the procedure to ensure women have access. \n",
      " \"Dr. Tiller's death was a devastating loss to the provider community and his family, but he was so admired and respected that his death has inspired medical students and providers to recommit themselves to providing women with the abortion care that they need,\" said Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation. \n",
      " Among them is Megan Evans, a third-year medical student at George Washington University who said she hopes to include abortion services as part of a larger obstetrics and gynecology practice. \n",
      " \"After he was killed, for me it assured me this was the right field to go into,\" she said. \n",
      " In the wake of Tiller's murder, Dr. Curtis Boyd of Albuquerque decided to provide third-trimester abortions on a case-by-case basis and hired two physicians who had worked at Tiller's clinic. \n",
      " Wichita-based Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group that followed Boyd's announcement by declaring it would open a satellite operation in Albuquerque, contends its movement has been winning for the past 15 years as abortion clinics close as a result of legislative efforts coupled with political and social pressures. \n",
      " Saporta contends there are now more doctors across the nation providing late abortions than there were before Tiller was killed, but she refuses to say how many or identify them for fear of making them instant targets. \n",
      " Kansas law permits an abortion on a viable fetus after the 21st week of pregnancy to save a mother's life or to prevent \"substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" \n",
      " State lawmakers who oppose abortion want to further restrict the law. They passed a bill that would require doctors' reports to the state include the exact medical diagnosis justifying a late-term abortion. It also would allow a doctor to be sued if the mother or her family had evidence that a late-term abortion violated Kansas law. But the Republican-controlled Legislature doesn't yet have the two-thirds majorities it needs to override a potential veto by Democratic Gov. Mark Parkinson, an abortion rights supporter. \n",
      " \"There's no reason not to do the right thing just because Tiller's clinic is closed,\" said Mary Kay Culp, executive director of Kansans for Life. \"The possibility exists that someone else could come into this state and run his business in the same way.\" \n",
      " The state Department of Health and Environment reported last week that the number of late-term abortions of viable fetuses dropped dramatically last year, from 192 in 2008 to 67 in 2009. The total number of abortions declined 11 percent, from about 10,600 in 2008 to about 9,500 in 2009. \n",
      " Abortion opponents argue that decline can be linked to an increase in crisis pregnancy centers and a new law requiring doctors to give women the option of seeing an ultrasound of their fetus before an abortion. \n",
      " But Rinker, the NOW lobbyist, said Roeder accomplished what the state's conservative lawmakers could not. \n",
      " \"We need more abortion clinics,\" she said. \"We need more physicians who aren't afraid to practice abortion procedures because of fear of legal repercussions.\" \n",

      " All around the NBA, players and team officials took care of last-minute business Tuesday before a lockout went into effect at midnight. The NBA said it had no choice but to stop operating until it could find a way to bring the growth of player salaries in line with revenues.  \n",
      " Pippen was one of 148 free agents who had been looking forward to July 1 as the day they would be free to shop their services to the highest bidder.  \n",
      " Now, like everyone else, they will have to wait until the lockout ends before they can start talking to teams.  \n",
      " \"We could have started sizing up our options, but now we'll just have to wait,\" said Jimmy Sexton, Pippen's agent. \"It's really nothing more than a delay. Whether it's resolved Sept. 1 or Dec. 1, we'll eventually go about our business the same way.\"  \n",
      " At team offices, staffs were briefed on the rules of the lockout _ for example, no direct contact with players for the duration. Trainers and medical personnel conferred with players on moving treatment sessions away from team facilities.  \n",
      " In the hours before the lockout began, the Houston Rockets brought in two of their rookies, Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley, for a final workout. The coach and general manager of the Toronto Raptors flew to Atlanta to meet with Charles Oakley and finalize last week's trade with the New York Knicks.  \n",

      " Olowokandi, drafted by the Clippers as the overall No. 1 pick last week, watched the Argentina-England World Cup soccer game while preparing to fly home to England for about three weeks.  \n",
      " \"I'll keep doing the things I need to do, working on my game and my conditioning,\" Olowokandi said. \"As much as I need offseason work, this will only motivate me because it stacks the odds against me even more.\"  \n",
      " Olowokandi was one of the players who figured to be most adversely affected by the lockout, since it will prevent him from playing for the Clippers in a summer league and honing his raw skills.  \n",
      " Other rookies and free agents will also have to deal with a summer of uncertainty, some being forced to make a hasty decision on their next career move.  \n",
      " Agent Steve Kauffman represents three free agents _ Stephen Howard (Sonics), Emanuel Davis (Rockets) and Darvin Ham (Wizards) _ who may head to Europe on one-year contracts.  \n",
      " \"They might have considered it as an option anyway, but throw in the uncertainty of the labor situation and they might bite when they otherwise might not have,\" Kauffman said.  \n",
      " This is the third lockout in four years. A lockout in the summer of 1995 lasted three months; in 1996 it lasted only a few hours.  \n",
      " The collective bargaining agreement that expired at midnight was supposed to run for six years. But owners had the right to reopen it if the amount of money being paid toward player salaries exceeded 51.8 percent of basketball-related income.  \n",
      " The owners are now devoting 57 percent of those revenues to player salaries, a total of almost dlrs 1 billion.  \n",
      " In nine negotiating sessions, owners and players made only minimal progress. Still, in the weeks and months leading up to Tuesday night's deadline there had been a general feeling that 11th-hour negotiations could somehow forestall a lockout.  \n",
      " Instead, the sides didn't even come close to resuming talks.  \n",

      "Mobile phone companies are about to barrage consumers with advertising for the next advance in wireless network technology: \"4G\" access. The companies are promising faster speeds and the thrill of being the first on the block to use a new acronym. \n",
      " But there's less to 4G than meets the eye, and there's little reason for people to scramble for it, at least for the next few years. \n",
      " Sprint Nextel Corp. is the first carrier to beat the drum for fourth-generation wireless technology. It's releasing its first 4G phone, the EVO, on June 4. \n",
      " In the fall, Verizon Wireless will be firing up its 4G network in 25 to 30 cities, and probably will make a big deal of that. A smaller provider, MetroPCS Communications Inc., is scheduled to introduce its first 4G phone around the same time. \n",
      " So what is 4G? \n",
      " Broadly speaking, it's a new way to use the airwaves, designed from the start for the transmission of data rather than phone calls. To do that, it borrows aspects of the latest generation of Wi-Fi, the short-range wireless technology. \n",
      " For consumers, 4G means, in the ideal case, faster access to data. For instance, streaming video might work better, with less stuttering and higher resolution. Videoconferencing is difficult on 3G and might work better on 4G. Multiplayer video games may benefit too. \n",
      " Other than that, it's difficult to point to completely new uses for 4G phones -- things they can do that 3G phones can't. \n",
      " Instead, the upgrade to 4G is more likely to enhance the things you can already do with 3G, said Matt Carter, president of Sprint's 4G division. \n",
      " \"View it as the difference between watching regular TV and high-definition TV,\" Carter said. \"Once you've experienced high-definition TV it's hard to go back to standard TV. It's the same sort of thing here.\" \n",
      " So the improvement from 3G to 4G is not as dramatic as the step from 2G to 3G, which for the first time made real Web browsing, video and music downloads practical on phones. The introduction of 3G started in earnest about five years ago, but it isn't complete -- AT&T Inc. and T-Mobile USA still have little rural 3G coverage, for instance. \n",
      " There's an important caveat to the claim that 4G will be faster, as well. It will definitely be faster than the 3G networks of Sprint and Verizon Wireless -- about four times faster, initially. But the other two U.S. carriers, AT&T and T-Mobile, are upgrading their 3G networks to offer data-transfer speeds that will actually be higher than the speeds 4G networks will reach this year or next. \n",
      " That means that rather than focusing on real speeds, Sprint and Verizon will try to frame their marketing around the \"4G\" term, said Dan Hays, who focuses on telecommunications at management consulting firm PRTM. \n",
      " \"It's a terrible story from a consumer standpoint, because it's tremendously confusing,\" he said. \n",
      " AT&T and T-Mobile are able to upgrade their 3G networks because they use a different 3G technology than Verizon and Sprint, which have maxed out their 3G speeds. Taking the step to 4G is natural for Verizon and Sprint, especially because they have new chunks of the radio spectrum that they want to take advantage of. \n",
      " The fact that Verizon Wireless and Sprint are adding fresh spectrum may be more important than the fact that they are using it for 4G service. No matter if used for 4G or 3G, new spectrum means the companies can accommodate more data-hungry devices such as smart phones. \n",
      " AT&T's network is already staggering under data congestion caused by the iPhone in New York and San Francisco. The carrier has made relieving the congestion a top priority this year, and its 3G upgrades are part of that process. (As an aside, there is a lot of talk of a coming \"iPhone 4G.\" Apple Inc. will most likely release the fourth generation of the iPhone for AT&T's network this summer, but it's virtually certain that it will not be able to use a 4G wireless network. It likely won't be called the \"iPhone 4G\" either.) \n",
      " There's another, more subtle benefit to 4G. While it's not always faster than the best 3G when it comes to helping you download a big file in less time, it is definitely faster in the sense that it takes less time to initiate the flow of data to you. What that means is that 4G is faster for quick back-and-forth communications. You wouldn't notice this when surfing the Web or doing e-mail: We're talking delays of 0.03 second rather than 0.15 second. But it could mean that 4G will work better for multiplayer gaming, where split-second timing is important. Even phone calls could benefit from shorter audio delays. \n",
      " Sprint and Verizon are taking different routes in 4G. Sprint owns a majority of Clearwire Corp., which is building a network using WiMax technology. Once seen as very promising, WiMax looks set to be a niche technology, and WiMax devices like the Sprint EVO phone won't be able to use networks built using the dominant 4G standard, called LTE, for Long Term Evolution. Verizon and MetroPCS plan to use LTE, as does AT&T, starting next year. T-Mobile says it will probably use LTE eventually. Even Sprint hasn't ruled out using LTE eventually, because the technology has huge momentum. \n",
      " In five years or so, many phones are likely to have 4G capabilities, but they'll complement it with 3G. Rather than a sudden revolution, consumers are likely to experience a gradual transition to the new technology, with increasing speeds. But for now, 4G is no magic bullet. \n",
      " \"It's an important thing for the industry,\" said Bill Davidson, senior vice president of marketing and investor relations at wireless technology developer Qualcomm Inc. \"It's absolutely needed. ... But I just think some of this has gotten a bit ahead of itself in terms of expectations for consumers.\": [12123, 11712, 9126]\n",

      "Among the anthems and flags, the fireworks and bagpipes, two scenes captured the essence of Hong Kong's most momentous night.  \n",
      " One was China's president smiling while Hong Kong's new government was sworn in; the other, the melancholy tableau on the rainy waterfront where Prince Charles sailed away.  \n",
      " Similar rituals have played out elsewhere during the 50-year decline of the British empire, but not until Hong Kong returned to China at the stroke of midnight Monday had they unfolded before the eyes of the whole world.  \n",
      " The final climactic hours of 156 years of colonial rule ended with a dignified British retreat aboard the royal yacht Britannia. Behind the pier, where Chinese and British cried, cheered and hugged the departing leaders, the Chinese flag fluttered over an army barracks.  \n",
      " For the anxious and excited 6.3 million people of Hong Kong, the uncertain era under the sovereignty of an exultant Communist China at last had begun.  \n",
      " \"The most precious thing for a nation and a people is to be master of their own destiny,\" said Tung Chee-hwa, the shipping tycoon chosen to lead the new Hong Kong as chief executive.  \n",
      " The brief handover ceremony administered the coup de grace to 19th-century colonialism and erased what China has always regarded as a fundamental humiliation _ the 1841 seizure of Hong Kong from a Chinese emperor too weak to defend his country.  \n",
      " For Britain, it was a melancholy reminder of its shrunken role on the world stage, although Prince Charles, along with Chris Patten, the last British governor, managed to turn their retreat into a restrained spectacle of British patriotism.  \n",
      " But the big question about Hong Kong is still unanswered: Can a free capitalist society survive in the embrace of a Communist power, even one that has promised to keep Hong Kong politically and economically free?  \n",
      " The initial signs seemed mildly encouraging.  \n",
      " The Chinese army, widely feared in Hong Kong, showed punctilious discipline rolling into Hong Kong six hours after the handover. Long convoys of trucks, jeeps, buses and armored vehicles carried in 4,000 soldiers, who were greeted at dawn by villagers who lined the road, waving flags and banging cymbals in the driving rain.  \n",
      " When some Chinese officers stopped and stepped out, villagers put garlands around their necks.  \n",
      " A rally by democrats, who oppose moves to trim civil liberties and dismantle the elected legislature, passed peacefully after the new, post-colonial government yielded to their demands to deliver speeches from the balcony of the legislature.  \n",
      " The new lawmaking body went straight to work after its swearing-in Tuesday, activating a package of laws it had already approved before the handover, including curbs on some of Hong Kong's civil liberties.  \n",
      " The curbs empower police to ban demonstrations and prohibit foreign donations to political parties. The package was approved by a voice vote without opposition.  \n",
      " Except for rain that drenched the British farewell ceremony, the choreographed, eight-hour rite of passage unfolded with no apparent hitch.  \n",
      " Seconds before midnight, the Union Jack and the colonial flag came down, and eight seconds after midnight, the Chinese flag hung alongside that of the newly renamed Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.  \n",
      " \"This is both a festival for the Chinese nation and a victory for the universal cause of peace and justice,\" President Jiang Zemin declared to the global array of foreign and Chinese VIPs assembled for the change of flags in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center.  \n",
      " \"From now on, the Hong Kong compatriots have become true masters of this Chinese land,\" the stocky, bespectacled president said.  \n",
      " Charles, heir to the British throne, said Britain was \"proud and privileged ... to have been part of the success which the Hong Kong people have made of their opportunities.\"  \n",
      " At midnight, a cable from Patten had gone to London, saying: \"I have relinquished the administration of this government. God Save the Queen.\"  \n",
      " After the flags changed, Charles and Patten boarded a motorcade that crept at a funereal pace down the deserted, rainswept road, headed for the royal yacht Britannia. On the pier, Chinese and British friends hugged the popular, silver-haired governor and shouted \"Hip, hip hurray!\"  \n",
      " In Beijing, as in Hong Kong, the night sky filled with fireworks, and China threw a party for 100,000 guests on Tiananmen Square.  \n",
      " Ninety minutes after the handover, Chinese Premier Li Peng briskly swore in Tung as chief executive of the government that will run Hong Kong as a semiautonomous territory, fenced off from China and retaining its freedoms and capitalist system.  \n",
      " Jiang, who had sat poker-faced through the flag change, beamed as the new government took office early Tuesday, along with the high court judges and the 60 members of the incoming legislature.  \n",
      " The swearing-in radiated continuity; almost all Tung's top officials served in the colonial administration, as did the high court judges, who wore their British-style wigs and robes as they took the oath.  \n",
      " But China controversially used the same ceremony to swear in the unelected legislature that will supplant the existing one.  \n",
      " That prompted a boycott by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair. But none of the ministers of some 40 other invited countries joined the protest.  \n",
      " China says the existing legislature must go because it was elected under rule changes to which it never agreed. Beijing is also rolling back some civil liberties enacted without its consent.  \n",
      " Many of the Western foreign ministers in Hong Kong for the handover say Tung assured them he would keep his promise of a fresh election within a year.  \n",
      " But lawmakers excluded from the provisional body denounced it from the balcony of the legislative building 40 minutes after the change of sovereignty.  \n",
      " \"We need the mutual trust of the Chinese leaders and our people. Sadly, that mutual trust has yet to be established,\" declared Martin Lee, leader of the Democrats, Hong Kong's largest party.  \n",

      " That contract, however, was written for a company, UAL Corp. and an industry very different from the one workers find themselves in today. It is a reality that Meyers and many others, demoralized by pay and benefit cuts, remain reluctant to accept. \n",
      " \"Everything keeps going up, man,\" says Meyers, leaning forward from one of the sofas. \"And we're just going backwards.\" \n",
      " The airline industry _ battered by record fuel prices, low-cost competition, the lingering effects of the Sept. 11 attacks and other problems _ is squeezing workers long accustomed to generous union-negotiated pay, robust pensions and enviable job security. \n",
      " Analysts say the workers have no choice but to adjust. They note that industries from steel to telecommunications are also cutting benefits, a trend that will likely continue. \n",
      " \"I do not think this is the last time an American industry will go through this kind of upheaval,\" said Darryl Jenkins, a professor of airline management at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida. \"This world is very much changing and unstable, and in those kinds of circumstances, this kind of change is inevitable.\" \n",
      " Airline workers tell similar stories of their start in the business, and the romance and prestige and financial rewards that came with the job. But that was before the industry launched into a maelstrom of cost-cutting. \n",
      " Most of those cuts have been directed at the labor costs that now account for nearly a third of airlines' operating costs. United baggage handlers, rampworkers and others shouldered an 11.5 percent pay cut in January, temporary until April and further negotiations. That is on top of an 18 percent cut two years ago. At USAirways Group Inc., flight attendants agreed to pay cuts of about 9 percent late last year, their third cut in 2 1/2 years. \n",
      " The average US Airways flight attendant now makes about $34,000 (euro25,650) a year, compared to a range of $45,000 (euro33,950) to $52,000 (euro39,225) a few years ago, union officials say. \n",
      " Some airline employees, like lead rampworkers at United, still earn close to $20 (euro15) an hour after the cuts _ better than $41,000 (euro30,930) a year before overtime pay _ and acknowledge they'd be hard-pressed to find a comparable job in the current economy. \n",
      " The next generation of workers are unlikely to approach such pay. When US Airways held a job fair this month outside Philadelphia to sign up new rampworkers, it was offering pay of $9.59 an hour (euro7.23). \n",
      " The cuts are a painful side effect of efforts by established carriers, known in the industry as legacy airlines, to make themselves more like JetBlue and other low-cost upstarts, industry analysts. \n",
      " \"US Air takes someone who was making $20 an hour and pays them $12 an hour, which might even be more than JetBlue, and that person remembers, being human, that they used to make $20,\" said Michael E. Levine, a former top executive at three airlines and now a law professor at Yale University. \n",
      " \"It's one of the challenges of the legacy network airlines,\" he said. \"They start with a labor force that has grown used to and felt entitled to work on terms that customers simply won't support.\" \n",
      " But workers, many who have logged years with the airlines and intended to stay until retirement, say they can't just ditch the mortgages, tuition bills and other expenses based on yesterday's paychecks. \n",
      " Consider the monthly budgeting worries of Eileen Zolinas, a 16-year flight attendant for US Airways whose husband, a mechanic for the airline, died in 1993. \n",
      " Without enough seniority, Zolinas flies \"on reserve\" _ airline speak for whenever she's called _ and gets paid for 71 hours of flight time monthly, though she usually flies less. She figures that she needs to work at least 95 hours a month to pay the bills. \n",
      " The limited hours and lower hourly wages have pared her annual earnings from about $40,000 (euro30,170) a few years ago to about $31,000 (euro23,385) last year. With the newest pay cut, she expects them to drop to about $26,000 (euro19,612). \n",
      " \"I can't afford to get part-time work because I'm on reserve and I never can tell when I'm going to get called,\" says Zolinas, whoives in Pennsylvania. \"I'm on pins and needles here. I don't know where to go or what to do.\" \n",
      " For years, Zolinas and her children, now 21 and 23, were covered without cost under her deceased husband's medical benefits. When the airline stopped providing those, Zolinas enrolled in the company plan on her own, but that costs about $200 (euro150) a month. \n",
      " Her son left Pennsylvania State University and moved back home to enroll at the University of Pittsburgh because he couldn't afford to pay for housing and she couldn't afford to help. \n",
      " Zolinas says the stress leaves her with frequent upset stomachs, but she avoids going to the doctor to save the $25 (euro19) co-pay. She considers whether to relocate to Philadelphia, where the airline is now directing more of its flights, or to try another line of work, but is reluctant to leave her hometown and her children. \n",
      " \"I can't go on this way much longer,\" she says.: [11808, 11745, 11345]\n",

      "and 20 protectionist Republicans _ voted to break a filibuster blocking a vote on a bill to impose harsh regulations on Mexican trucks operating in the U.S. Under current law, Mexican truckers are only allowed to operate within a 20-mile (32-kilometer) zone north of the border. But under the 8-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement, they are supposed to get open access to all of the country by Jan. 1. The unions hate NAFTA even though it has done no demonstrable harm to their interests and the Teamsters certainly don't want any competition on the road. ... The Democrats' bill _ which President Bush has promised to veto _ would require Mexican trucks to meet stricter safety regulations than those imposed on Canadian or American trucks already doing business in the U.S. It's plainly discriminatory. ... There is something racially insensitive about that attitude, and it's all the harder to understand since so many Democrats can't wait to grant amnesty to 3 million illegal immigrants from Mexico. Is it the party's position that people from Mexico can cross the border without restriction as long as they don't bring their trucks? This is nothing but crude, base politics in the service of foolish, backward economics.  The Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, on Bush and the Biological Weapons Convention: Globalists reacted to President Bush's decision to end talks on enforcing the Biological Weapons Convention as if he had laced their food with anthrax, but they should have seen this one coming. U.S. officials told the world when they signed the BWC in 1972 that it could not be enforced without violating America's Constitution, and that hurdle remains as insurmountable today as it was then. The enforcement protocol would have authorized teams of foreign inspectors to search, among other subjects, private U.S. biotech businesses. Besides widespread skepticism about the effectiveness of such searches (no biological weapons have been found by inspectors in Iraq, for example), the plan presented at least three clear constitutional problems: The only way such inspectors could legally gain police powers in America is if they were handpicked by the president. This is spelled out in the Constitution's Appointments Clause, which was meant to ensure that the electorate could hold U.S. officials accountable for the actions of their officers. But since the inspectors would be chosen by a foreign tribunal _ the only way to guarantee their impartiality _ they could not legally operate in the United States even if the president and Congress were willing to allow it. ... European collectivists and their fellow travelers in the U.S. media are gnashing their teeth at what they see as the latest example of Bush's reluctance to \"join the world community.\" But as long as the admission price is the subjugation of Americans' constitutional rights to foreign tribunals, the president has no choice but to go it alone.  The Tulsa World, Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Cuba-American relationships: The recent fainting spell of Cuba's Fidel Castro should send a signal to the United States and a shudder down the spine of Cuba-watchers. ... ... Bush pledged during the campaign and since his election that he will tighten the 40-year-old embargo on Cuba, which unfortunately hurts no one but the Cuban people. When the 75-year-old Castro finally dies _ it's unlikely that he will voluntarily step down; few dictators do _ there will be a power struggle among his hand- picked bureaucrats. ... A peaceful market economy and eventual democracy is the hoped-for scenario. But to see that happen, the United States must not continue to unnecessarily punish Cuba. The four-decade embargo has not loosened Castro's grip. It has merely forced the Cuban people into horrible poverty and given Castro an excuse to blame the United States. The only hope for Cuba is a gradual opening of relations with the United States. More trade means more economic hope for the Cubans. Open political discussions could establish a link to Castro's successor. Closer, more open ties with Cuba, not more isolation, is the key to life in Cuba after Castro. slot v0457/tw: [13268, 13097, 11295]\n",

      " The administration invited House members to a White House meeting Tuesday morning in advance of the House vote to press its case for keeping the embargo in place.  \n",
      " Presidential press secretary Mike McCurry said many House lawmakers who had sought to end the arms ban are beginning to understand that \"a vote to lift the arms embargo is a vote to put U.S. troops on the ground in Bosnia.\"  \n",

      " Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, a leading contender for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination, co-authored the bill ending the embargo.

      "The United Nations has toned down a report detailing hundreds of gruesome attacks against civilians in Congo over a 10-year period but left intact the suggestion that Rwanda's army may have committed genocide there in the 1990s. \n",
      " Rwanda and its northern neighbor Uganda had protested a leaked draft of the report last month, threatening to pull their soldiers from U.N. peacekeeping missions unless changes were made to the published version. \n",
      " The final report, obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, shows that the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights rewrote sensitive sections of the 545-page document to couch them in less inflammatory language. \n",
      " For instance, an earlier reference to \"damning elements\" that could be used by a court to conclude that genocide took place has been changed to \"inculpatory elements.\" \n",
      " Another section elaborates at length -- compared with the earlier draft -- on a number of \"countervailing factors\" that could be used to argue that such a crime didn't take place. A draft section that dismissed mitigating arguments was dropped entirely. \n",
      " Despite the changes, Rwandan Foreign Affairs Minister Louise Mushikiwabo said Thursday that the document was \"flawed and dangerous from start to finish.\" \n",
      " Mushikiwabo claimed the report had been manipulated by \"organizations and individuals\" seeking to rewrite Rwanda's history. \n",
      " Rwandan President Paul Kagame, a U.S. ally, has long claimed the moral high ground for ending the 1994 genocide in his country, during which more than half a million people, mostly Tutsis but also some moderate Hutus, were killed. But the U.N. report casts doubt on Rwanda's claim that it was only pursuing those responsible for the Rwandan genocide when it sent troops across the border into eastern Congo in 1996. \n",
      " Mushikiwabo said the $3 million report, which details more than 600 incidents between 1993 and 2003 in which tens of thousands of people -- mostly women and children -- were killed, ignored the historical situation and relied overly on questionable sources. \n",
      " Ugandan officials also dismissed the report. A spokesman for Uganda's army, which was involved in several conflicts in the area of eastern Congo in the 1990s, on Thursday called the report \"rubbish.\" \n",
      " \"We have not taken it kindly,\" said Lt. Col. Felix Kulayigye. \"They have not asked us about the allegations. They did not get our side of the story.\" \n",
      " Ugandan Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa warned in a letter to the U.N. human rights office that the report undermined efforts made by countries in the region toward regional peace and security. \n",
      " \"Such sinister tactics undermine Uganda's resolve to continue contributing to, and participating in, various regional and international peacekeeping operations,\" he said. \n",
      " If both countries make good on their threat to withdraw troops it could create a headache for the United Nations. \n",
      " Rwanda, a small country in East Africa, contributes thousands of soldiers to U.N. peacekeeping operations in Chad, Haiti, Liberia and mainly Sudan. Larger Uganda is a significant contributor to the African-led force in Somalia. \n",
      " A spokesman for the U.N. human rights office declined to comment ahead of the report's official release in Geneva on Friday. \n",
      " U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay had delayed publication for several weeks to give affected governments time to publish their comments alongside the final version. \n",
      " The report, which includes interviews with over 1,280 witnesses, concludes by suggesting ways in which Congo's government, together with the international community, could prosecute the perpetrators of crimes and assist survivors. \n",
      " Amnesty International described the report as \"a very thorough investigation\" and called for pressure by donor countries to make Congo prosecute alleged perpetrators. \n",
      " \"What we want now is for action to be taken,\" said Veronique Aubert, deputy director of the group's Africa Program. \"The cycle of violence in the region will only stop if those responsible for these horrific crimes are held to account.\" \n",

      "The Sudanese government has launched a campaign to stop a U.N. force from taking over peacekeeping duties from African Union troops, the top U.N. envoy in Sudan said Tuesday. \n",
      " At the same time, Jan Pronk said an anti-United Nations climate is heating up strongly in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, with threats and warnings, and fear that handing over to a U.N. force would put Sudan \"in the same situation as Iraq a couple of years ago.\" \n",
      " On Jan. 12, ambassadors on the African Union's Peace and Security Council agreed in principle to hand over peacekeeping to the U.N. but left a final decision to a ministerial meeting on Friday. In the meantime, the U.N. Security Council authorized the start of planning for a takeover, and U.S. Ambassador John Bolton tried unsuccessfully to get the council to authorize the new U.N. force. \n",
      " Pronk told a news conference the African Union may be reconsidering the decision to relinquish peacekeeping responsibilities. He said Friday's scheduled ministerial meeting has been postponed for a week at Sudan's request until March 10. \n",
      " \"Sudan has sent delegations to many countries in the world in order to plead for its case, namely, let the African Union stay and let the U.N. not come _ no transition,\" he said. \n",
      " \"We do not know whether the African Union next Friday will reconfirm its own decision. That is not certain any more,\" Pronk said. \n",

      " An estimated 180,000 people have died, mainly of hunger and disease, and some 2 million have been displaced since rebels from Darfur's ethnic African population revolted three years ago, accusing the Arab-dominated government in Khartoum of discrimination and decades of neglect. The Sudanese government is widely alleged to have unleashed Arab militias who carried out sweeping atrocities against ethnic African villagers. Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir denies his government supports the militia, known as Janjaweed. \n",
      " Pronk told reporters the situation in Darfur remains difficult with groups of 3,000 militia on camel and horseback attacking villages with army cars behind them. \n",
      " That means a robust force is still needed to prevent attacks as well as a peace agreement to end the conflict. \n",
      " Pronk said there is a possibility that peace talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, could produce an agreement in March, but \"the most important question is not whether there will be an agreement but what will be in the agreement.\" \n",
      " A peace agreement must have teeth and ensure that the parties do not return to fighting and that violators are punished, he said. \n",
      " In the next few weeks, Pronk said, \"there are many uncertain variables\" including the future of the African Union force, a possible peace agreement, and an international meeting which had been scheduled for February in Europe, where donors had been expected to pledge enough resources for the African Union force to stay through the transition to a U.N. force. \n",
      " If the African Union decides against a handover, Pronk said, there will also be a question of whether it can stay in Darfur \"because there are no resources.\" \n",
      " Earlier this month, U.S. President George W. Bush made his strongest statement of support yet for an expanded international role in Darfur, backing a larger force for Darfur and NATO invovlement. \n",
      " Pronk said a NATO-led force in Darfur would be \"a recipe for disaster.\" \n",
      " \"As soon as you make clear to them that there will be decisions without consultation and just come in, then they speak of recolonization, invasion, imperialism and they speak about Iraq and Afghanistan, that is the fear,\" Pronk said, recalling meetings with traditional leaders in Darfur. \n",

      " On Friday, Dr. David Gerrard, chairman of FINA's sports medicine committee, said his group's executive director Cornel Marculescu had issued a directive to the Australian Sports Drug Agency authorizing it to test swimmers for EPO on Sunday and Monday _ the final two days of the Goodwill Games swim meet.  \n",
      " Under a system first used at the Sydney Olympics, swimmers will be randomly blood and urine tested. Swimmers would have to fail both samples in order to return a positive test, and any swimmer recording a world record will automatically be tested for EPO.  \n",

      " \"We're going to talk to the swimmers to let them know that we'll begin on Sunday,\" Gerrard said Friday. \"We think it's only fair because they came into this meet thinking that wouldn't be the case.\"  \n",

      "Two studies released today found that guidelines for taking a revolutionary clot-busting drug are frequently violated -- lapses that may be causing dangerous bleeding and even deaths among stroke victims.  \n",
      " For TPA to be effective, it must be administered within three hours of the onset of a stroke or it's ineffective and may be dangerous.  \n",
      " Doctors must also perform a brain scan first to rule out bleeding in the brain. TPA can cause bleeding or worsen a hemorrhage, with sometimes fatal results.  \n",
      " The studies appear in today's Journal of the American Medical Association. The findings validate \"the concerns that a lot of physicians have had that if you're not careful about exactly how you're using this medication, you might do more harm than good,\" said Dr. Gregory Albers, a Stanford University neurologist and lead author of one of the studies.  \n",
      " Strokes are the nation's third-leading cause of death, killing an estimated 159,000 people each year and leaving many survivors disabled.  \n",
      " TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator, is the only federally approved drug treatment. It won quick approval in 1996 after research demonstrated its benefits in strokes caused by clots in the brain. About 80 percent of the estimated 600,000 strokes reported each year are caused by such clots.  \n",
      " While TPA is expensive -- about $2,000 per intravenous dose -- it is cost-effective in the long run by preventing or lessening neurological damage caused by strokes, Albers said.  \n",
      " TPA was approved with a mandate for another study of its benefits. That study was led by Albers, whose results are similar to the initial research.  \n",
      " Albers' study involved 57 medical centers nationwide that were well-versed in TPA treatment. It was funded by Genentech, the maker of the drug. The second study -- of 29 community hospitals in the Cleveland area -- offers a snapshot of what happens when TPA treatment is attempted in less experienced settings.  \n",
      " The Cleveland researchers examined 3,948 stroke patients. Only 70 -- just 1.8 percent -- were given TPA, suggesting that eligible patients were being overlooked.  \n",
      " But in half of those who did get the drug, treatment guidelines were violated. Some patients got TPA as much as six hours after the three-hour deadline.  \n",
      " Those violations contributed to a slightly higher death rate than in Albers' study and significantly more cases of bleeding in the brain, said Dr. Irene Katzan, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.  \n",
      " Eleven of the TPA patients -- 15.7 percent -- had brain bleeding, more than three times the rate in Albers' study. Six of those died. Five other Cleveland-area TPA patients also died in the hospital, for a mortality rate of 15.7 percent.  \n",
      " In the study by Albers and his colleagues, 389 patients were treated with TPA. Fifty-one died within a month, a mortality rate of 13 percent.  \n",
      " Thirty-five percent were essentially normal and showed no sign of stroke complications 30 days after TPA treatment. Forty-three percent were able to go home and care for themselves, though they had some mild complications such as slurred speech.  \n",
      " Treatment guidelines were violated in about a third of the patients. Brain bleeding occurred in 3.3 percent within three days of TPA treatment, and seven of those died.  \n",

      "Sony Corp. said a glitch has knocked PlayStation 3 users off the game console's online network, and the company warned that data loss could occur if gamers continued using the machines. \n",
      " Sony said in a blog post Monday that the problem was likely caused by a bug in the clock functionality incorporated in the system, reminiscent of the Y2K bug a decade ago. The problem is affecting older PlayStation 3 models, but not the newest slim version that went on sale in September. \n",
      " The company urged customers not to use the older PlayStation 3 systems until the problem is resolved, warning that doing so could cause errors and make it impossible to record gaming achievements and restore some data. \n",
      " Sony would not say how many users were affected by the problem, which comes just as PlayStation 3 sales are picking up. According to the NPD Group, 276,900 units of the system sold in January in the United States, up from 203,200 a year earlier. In December 2009, meanwhile, nearly 1.4 million PlayStation 3 consoles were sold in the U.S. \n",
      " Errors that PS3 users started seeing Sunday include the date of the systems being reset to Jan. 1, 2000. \n",
      " The problem was reminiscent of the Y2K bug, in which programming shortcuts caused some computers to malfunction in the new millennium because they interpreted \"00\" as the year 1900. Although a mass computer meltdown didn't result, as some people had feared, hiccups were reported around the world. \n",
      " Other problems resulting from the Sony glitch can include an error message saying the user has been logged out of the online game network. Users' game trophies -- their accomplishments -- can also disappear. \n",
      " Sony is not the first to deal with a Y2K-like bug years after 2000. At the end of 2008, thousands of Microsoft Corp.'s Zune media players unexpectedly crashed, prompting references to \"Y2K for Zunes.\" Microsoft said at the time that the failures, which affected only the 30-gigabyte Zune models, were caused by a problem with their internal clock. \n",
      " Sony said Monday that it hopes to resolve the problem within 24 hours. \n",

      "Myanmar needs more than food and shelter. It needs human expertise for everything from cleaning water to mental health counseling -- and right now, those experts can't get to the hard-hit delta. \n",
      " Dozens of aid workers from UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and other groups are still stuck in Yangon, the nation's largest city, without the required travel permits to leave for the delta region. These workers include Red Cross water quality engineers, for example, to train their local counterparts to run major drinking water treatment plants. \n",
      " \"The priority is drinking water,\" UNICEF spokeswoman Shantha Bloemen said Friday. \n",
      " For the first several weeks after Cyclone Nargis struck May 2-3, few of the more than 2 million survivors received any help. Myanmar's government only has about 15 transport planes that cannot carry tons of food and up to 40 aging helicopters, many not working, experts say. \n",
      " Foreign aid agencies are now trying to get in not just trucks and helicopters, but also workers with experience from dealing with disasters like the 2004 Asian tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake. \n",
      " \"It's not about extra pairs of hands; there are special skills that are required,\" said Richard Horsey, a spokesman for the U.N. humanitarian effort that is trying, like other groups, to reach the country's flooded Irrawaddy delta. \n",
      " Relief officials say they are poised to: \n",
      " -- Set up dozens of drinking water treatment plants in the delta and operate hand pumps and other equipment to desalinate wells and fields contaminated by the saltwater tidal surge. \n",
      " -- Send in health and nutrition experts to track disease and to identify acute cases of malnutrition, particularly in children, and mental health counselors. \n",
      " -- Join local teams to conduct emergency assessments of just what help is most needed, including food, water, shelter and medicine, and how many schools and other public facilities are required. UNICEF said Friday that more than 4,000 schools serving 1 million children were either damaged or destroyed. \n",
      " Some people in Myanmar are already trained to deal with similar problems but not on such a large scale, said John Sparrow, Red Cross spokesman for the Asia-Pacific region. \n",
      " \"The kind of expertise you need doesn't come overnight, and that's why we need the expatriates in there,\" he said. Those who have handled multiple disasters will be able to reach more people and work more efficiently and quickly, he said. \n",
      " On Saturday, a U.N. official warned Myanmar against prematurely resettling cyclone refugees, saying those who leave relief camps may not receive the aid they need and will become even more vulnerable to disease and the elements. Human rights groups have lambasted Myanmar's military rulers, accusing them of kicking homeless cyclone survivors out of shelters. The U.S. defense secretary said the junta's blockage of international help has cost \"tens of thousands of lives.\" \n",
      " Few countries can deal with such a huge disaster, let alone one of the poorest nations in Asia. Senior Gen. Than Shwe and other top generals who run the country have spent most of the money on the military's 400,000 soldiers. \n",
      " But some foreign aid workers with a history of working in Myanmar say the government's resistance to foreign assistance also has sparked an impressive grass roots effort to deliver aid. \n",
      " \"It's come from the Myanmar people themselves,\" said Curt Bradner, who with his wife, Cathy, has been working on a water treatment project called Thirst-Aid the past two years in Myanmar. \n",
      " \"They may not be responding as quickly as the international community would like to see happen,\" he said of Myanmar's people. \"But in their own way, they're really doing an excellent job. This is a country that is 300 years behind the rest of the world, in many respects. Only 7 percent of the country has electricity. It's astounding.\" \n",

      " After being sent into bat, South Africa, ground out the New Zealand attack for 13 hours and 13 minutes and finished a run short of the record 622 for nine posted by Ali Bacher's side against Australia at Kingsmead in 1969-70.  \n",
      " Cullinan, provided the backbone of the South African batting as he shared three record stands with Gary Kirsten (128), Jonty Rhodes (63) and Pollock (69 not out).  \n",

      " Lorena Ochoa made a whopper of a mistake that might cost her a chance to win her first major and move to No. 1 in the world. \n",
      " The 25-year-old Mexican star whiffed a flop shot on her way to a quadruple bogey on the par-3 17th hole on Saturday, leaving Pak and Suzann Pettersen atop the leaderboard at Mission Hills in a major that no one seems to want to win. \n",
      " If Saturday was any indication, the tournament could come down to who doesn't lose it. \n",

      " Paula Creamer had a wedge into the par-5 18th and walked off with a three-putt bogey for a 73 that put her one shot behind along with Meaghan Francella (69). Big-hitting Brittany Lincicome eagled the final hole for a 71 and was another shot behind. \n",
      " But the buzz came from Ochoa, for all the wrong reasons. \n",
      " She was 3 under and one shot behind on the 17th when her 6-iron clipped a tree and her pitch to a back left pin went long into grass so deep she could barely see the ball. Trying to hit a flop shot, the club slid under the ball without moving it. Her fourth shot ran down the ridge some 45 feet away. Three putts later she had a 7 on her card and was no longer in the top 10. \n",

      " \"I was one behind, and suddenly I'm way back,\" Ochoa said in clipped answers, still seething over her bad fortune. \"I'm OK. I'm happy to be here for tomorrow. I'm glad I'll be playing behind now. I have nothing to lose. Hopefully, I'll put pressure on the leaders.\" \n",
      " There was plenty of pressure in the third round, most of that coming from a baked course at Mission Hills that put a high premium on keeping the ball in the short grass. \n",
      " Five players had at least a share of the lead at one point on a blistering hot afternoon. \n",
      " Pak, who has never finished higher than ninth in this major, got to 5 under with an approach that hit the flag and settled 2 feet away on the 13th to take the lead. Then came a couple of bogeys, electing to use putter from short of the green on the 15th, and flubbing a chip over a hump in the fringe on the 17th that made her work for bogey. \n",
      " But she was all smiles leaving the 18th after her big birdie, and knows exactly what is at stake on Sunday. \n",
      " \"You can't really think of that,\" Pak said. \"There's just so much trouble out there. Even par is a good score.\" \n",
      " One advantage for Pak? \n",
      " Of the top 15 players on the leaderboard, she is the only one to have captured a major. \n",
      " \"I don't really have much pressure because I've been there a lot of times,\" she said. \n",
      " It will be a first for Pettersen, the feisty Norwegian who missed eighth months a few years ago with a back injury. She managed a relatively quiet round, picking up birdies on two par 5s, limiting her mistake to only the 13th hole when it took her four shots to reach the green during some adventures in the high grass. \n",
      " The surprise in many cases is Francella. \n",
      " The only time the 24-year-old rookie had been to Mission Hills was for qualifying school, and she wasn't even in the tournament until beating Annika Sorenstam in a playoff in Mexico this month. \n",

      "Because of a lethal combination of geology and geography, the people of American Samoa did not stand much of a chance. \n",
      " Almost every condition that triggers bad tsunamis was in place this time, generating waves that raced toward the island territory at speeds approaching 530 mph (850 kph), or as fast as a 747 jumbo jet. There was almost nothing to slow the water down. \n",
      " It all started with a type of earthquake that tends to generate strong tsunamis because of the angle at which the ground breaks. Also, the quake was extremely powerful, with a magnitude of 8.0. It struck just below the ocean floor, which means very little lost energy. And it happened in deep water, which means bigger waves. \n",
      " The deeper water also meant the tsunami sped along the ocean faster. American Samoa happened to be close to the epicenter, about 125 miles, and at just the right angle, with almost no shallow water to slow the speeding waves down. \n",
      " Put that all together and there was less than 25 minutes, maybe as little as 13 minutes, between the ground shaking and the first tremendous waves swamping Samoa. \n",
      " It did not help that an international computerized system, designed for relief agencies to determine if they needed to respond, had a computer failure that caused it initially to minimize the tsunami's wrath. \n",
      " \"This is the kind of earthquake one would expect to be very destructive in the areas close to the epicenter, and unfortunately it was,\" said Stuart Weinstein, deputy director at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Ewa Beach, Hawaii. \n",
      " The shaking at the weather service office in Pago Pago, the capital of American Samoa, was so bad that one official immediately called the tsunami warning center in Hawaii, while the island's chief meteorologist phoned homeland security to activate the warning system. Just before 7 a.m. local time, bulletins were issued and alerts aired on TV and radio. \n",
      " There was not enough time. Four sets of waves 15 to 20 feet high hit. As of Wednesday afternoon, the death toll had climbed well over 100. \n",
      " \"It's one of those heart-wrenching situations where you have some time, but what can you do? It's not much time,\" said Eric Geist, a tsunami specialist and geophysicist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. \n",
      " Tsunamis are towering waves triggered by earthquakes. They can top 100 feet, and can stick around for as much as an hour, recede violently, then come back hours later. \n",
      " In some ways, the geological conditions were even worse for Tuesday's tsunami than they were during the devastating 9.0-magnitude quake and tsunami that killed more than 150,000 people in Asia in 2004. But this time, there were fewer people in harm's way in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. \n",
      " The key factor this time was the type of earthquake. It was an \"outer rise\" quake, the kind that breaks the sea floor in a way that concentrates the energy and pushes up at the water to create a wave, said Bruce Jaffe, an oceanographer and tsunami specialist at USGS in Santa Cruz, California. Strong quakes are usually a different type, called a thrust event. \n",
      " The area where it hit is no stranger to quakes, getting a few magnitude-6-to-7 ones per year, said Peggy Hellweg, a geophysicist at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory. Because quakes are measured on a logarithmic scale, a magnitude-8 is 1,000 times stronger than a magnitude-6 in terms of energy released, Hellweg said. \n",
      " Tuesday's quake was the fourth-strongest outer rise on record, Geist said. \n",
      " This quake also was relatively shallow in the ground, only 11.2 (18 kilometers) miles under the sea floor. That is important because the closer the quake is to the surface of the ocean, the less energy dissipates as it travels through the ground. \n",
      " It was also in deep water. Initial estimates are that there was well over 3 miles (5 kilometers), maybe even 4 miles (6 kilometers), of water above the shaking ground, Geist said. That means more water displaced, and thus bigger waves. If there had been only 1 mile of water above the quake, the waves would have been about 11 feet smaller, Geist estimated. \n",
      " That deep water also was responsible for the blinding speed of the tsunami. The deeper the water, the faster a tsunami travels. \n",
      " This water was so deep that the tsunami could have been zipping along at 530 mph (853 kph), Geist said. Usually, a tsunami slows down when it hits shallow water. Around the United States, for example, the shallow continental shelf slows downs waves dramatically. \n",
      " Samoa did not have that protection until just before the tsunami reached the shore. And by the time it hit, it was still coming at 30 mph (48 kph). \n",
      " And by the time a person sees a tsunami, \"it's usually too late to outrun it,\" Geist said. \n",

      "Eight years after civil war tore the world's top cocoa producer in two, Ivory Coast finally held a long-awaited presidential ballot that millions of people here are praying will reunite the country and restore desperately needed stability. \n",
      " But the West African nation is at a pivotal crossroads: Many also fear the poll could herald a new era of unrest if political rivals, powerful militias or still-armed rebels don't accept the outcome. \n",
      " \"There is a mixture of hope and fear among us all,\" 50-year-old civil servant Eliane Bah said after casting her ballot at a school in Abidjan, where glass skyscrapers and crumbling apartment blocks overlook a brown lagoon snaking through the vast Francophone metropolis. \n",
      " \"We hope this is the end of the crisis. We're really, really tired of it,\" she said. But one nagging question remains: \"Is this really the end of the war?\" \n",
      " Though voting Sunday was peaceful, ballot counting could prove highly contentious. Angry, machete-wielding youth backing both the ruling and opposition parties have a history of taking violently to the streets here when political fortunes don't go their way. \n",
      " Some residents already have been stocking up on food and fuel, fearing riots or street clashes could break out. \n",
      " On the eve of the ballot, Prime Minister Guillaume Soro -- the former rebel leader -- called on all sides to accept the outcome. As night fell, vote counting got swiftly under way, and preliminary results are expected by Wednesday, or earlier. \n",
      " The 9,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force, which prominently deployed several armored personnel carriers Sunday in Abidjan, began helping transport ballot records from 10,000 polling stations after polls closed. \n",
      " The 65-year-old incumbent, President Laurent Gbagbo, has been in power since 2000, when tens of thousands of militant supporters launched mass protests to prevent the late junta leader Robert Guei from stealing the country's last vote. \n",
      " Gbagbo's mandate officially expired five years later, but he has stayed in office since, claiming elections were impossible because of a 2002-2003 war that left rebels in control of the north. \n",
      " On Sunday, he faced 13 other challengers. The heavyweights among them are 68-year-old opposition leader Alassane Ouattara, who is wildly popular in the pro-rebel north, and 76-year-old ex-president Henri Konan Bedie, who was toppled in 1999 when the nation's first coup triggered an epoch of turmoil and economic decline from which Ivory Coast has yet to recover. \n",
      " If no candidate wins a simple majority, the top two finishers will face off in a second round Nov. 28. \n",
      " Long lines were reported across the nation. In Abidjan, voters queued in some places in the pre-dawn darkness as early as 4 a.m. because \"there is a real desire for change,\" said 56-year-old Mamadou, a retired civil servant who refused to give his full name, fearing repercussions for expressing his opinion. \n",
      " \"People just want this crisis to be over,\" he said. \"We want to move on.\" \n",
      " Through years of political stalemate, the northern rebels and their supporters profited handsomely from the gold trade and diamond smuggling. And in the south, exports of cocoa -- the raw material for chocolate -- boomed. Over the last eight years, crude oil exports have risen six-fold to around 60,000 barrels per day. \n",
      " But crime spiked in Abidjan, where many businesses died off, stagnated or moved elsewhere in the region amid a steady economic decline. \n",
      " A 2007 peace deal in neighboring Burkina Faso finally broke through the gloom. Soro was appointed prime minister in a unity government. A U.N.-patrolled buffer zone disappeared. And a roadmap for elections was drawn up. \n",
      " The rebels were supposed to lay down arms, but disarmament never really happened. Instead, the insurgents merely returned to barracks and today still wear patches identifying them as members of the New Forces rebel movement. \n",
      " In the lawless west, meanwhile, tens of thousands of militias that sprang up during the war still hold such sway they were able to prevent the three top candidates from holding campaign rallies in the western town of Guiglo. \n",
      " Despite such shortcomings, one major issue at the heart of the crisis was tackled: deciding who could legitimately vote. \n",
      " More than a quarter of the country's 20 million people are foreign immigrants who came to work on cocoa and coffee plantations in the south. Differentiating them from native Ivorians with roots and names common in neighboring countries like Burkina Faso and Mali has taken years. \n",
      " \"There's been progress, but the identity crisis is not over,\" said Mamadou. \"There's still ethnic and regional discrimination. It exists in people's minds. We see it every day.\" \n",
      " Gbagbo's party believes countless foreigners have falsified documents to vote in an opposition- and rebel-fueled plot to skew the poll. Even Ouattara, they say, is not really from Ivory Coast. Ouattara and his supporters vehemently deny the allegations, and contend the process has merely helped cement legitimate rights to citizenship. \n",
      " Despite perceived imperfections, though, all parties have accepted the 5.7-million-strong voter roll and the U.N. deemed it credible. \n",
      " Last month, Gbagbo finally validated the list, and only in the weeks since has the government began handing out millions of new identity cards. An estimated $400 million has been spent identifying voters and issuing slick, state-of-the-art IDs. \n",
      " In a village just outside the former rebel stronghold of Bouake, people waited Sunday in the shade of palm and mango trees to vote in a wood-framed, grass-covered shelter. One of them was N'goran Suzanne Yao, a mother of nine who works at the local mayor's office but has hasn't been paid in months. \n",
      " \"We've waited a long time\" for this election, she said. \"There will be a change ... if the vote is calm.\" \n",

      "A Puerto Rican civil rights leader said Tuesday he was ready to start sending a trove of documents from Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor's past to the Senate committee that will consider her nomination. \n",
      " Cesar Perales, head of the legal advocacy group LatinoJustice PRLDEF said he would send the Judiciary Committee minutes of meetings Sotomayor participated in as a board member of the group from 1980 until 1992, as well as pleadings from cases it handled while Sotomayor headed the board's litigation committee. \n",
      " Republicans and conservative interest groups have criticized Sotomayor's involvement with the organization -- formerly known as the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund -- and called it radical. Among causes it took up while Sotomayor served on the board were bilingual education, support for abortion rights and opposition to the death penalty, which it equated with racism. \n",
      " Democrats defend her participation in what they call a mainstream civil rights organization. \n",
      " It was unclear what effect, if any, the disclosures might have on Sotomayor's nomination, since she had no direct involvement with the group's legal activities. The litigation panel she sat on was an outside group that did not participate in cases but set broad policy and guidelines. \n",
      " \"She was on the board of directors, she was not a member of the legal staff, so she was not directly involved in the legal arguments that we presented,\" Perales told The Associated Press in an interview. \"Her role was to help us raise funds, set policy, hire the person who would run the organization. ... We don't expect to uncover anything particularly interesting.\" \n",
      " Still, Perales and his staff have been combing through 300 cartons of documents for any bit of paper that might be pertinent to Sotomayor's confirmation process. That includes any letter, report or memo written by any committee she served on during her dozen years on the board. \n",
      " Republicans and Democrats teamed to request the documents, and Republican senators have suggested the delay in uncovering them is grounds for delaying hearings on the nomination, now set to begin on July 13. \n",
      " Perales said the Judiciary panel should have all the material by the end of the week. \n",

      "A brand of body armor banned by the Army also failed Air Force tests, and some of the vests were recalled, Army officials said Friday in defending their decision to require that soldiers wear only protective gear issued by the military. \n",
      " Army Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Sorenson, who manages the buying of body armor, dismissed claims by California-based Pinnacle Armor and other companies that their gear can match Army-issue armor. \n",
      " \"They have not been tested,\" Sorenson told reporters. \"They have not passed the rigor that we put into standards determining whether something is safe, effective and suitable.\" \n",
      " Under a new Army directive, soldiers can no longer wear commercially bought body armor. The Army said it cannot guarantee the quality of the commercial armor, and any soldier wearing it will have to turn it in. \n",
      " Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman said Friday there are no plans to enforce such a policy across all the military services. \n",
      " Sorenson also referred briefly to the recall of Pinnacle vests by \"another service,\" but didn't name the Air Force. He said any soldiers who defy the order and wear commercial armor could be disciplined. \n",
      " \"If soldiers are doing this, they're doing it at their own risk,\" said Sorenson. \"And quite frankly, it's probably not advisable, because we have not found that protection provided by these other particular systems is anywhere near what the soldiers have today.\" \n",
      " Josh Holly, a spokesman for the Armed Services Committee in the House of Representatives, said its members became suspicious of Pinnacle gear after learning the company's latest version of Dragon Skin armor failed Air Force ballistic tests in February. \n",
      " Holly said committee staff recently met with Pinnacle officials to encourage the company to try for more Army testing, even volunteering to serve as independent witnesses to the tests. \n",
      " He said the committee requested the meeting to ensure soldiers get the best equipment. \n",
      " The Army told The Associated Press on Thursday the order banning commercial armor was prompted by concerns that soldiers or their families were buying inadequate or untested gear from private companies _ including Pinnacle's popular Dragon Skin. \n",
      " Murray Neal, chief executive officer of Pinnacle, said he wants to review the order. \n",
      " \"We know of no reason the Army may have to justify this action,\" Neal said. \"On the surface this looks to be another of many attempts by the Army to cover up the billions of dollars spent on ineffective body armor systems which they continue to try quick fixes on, to no avail.\" \n",
      " Early in the Iraq war, soldiers and their families were spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on protective gear that they said the military was not providing. Last October, after months of pressure from families and members of Congress, the military began a reimbursement program for soldiers who had bought their own protective equipment. \n",

      "Defying government warnings, Filipinos greeted 1997 with rowdy merry-making that left at least three people dead and 168 others injured, police and health officials said Wednesday.  \n",
      " But Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica said there was a \"dramatic decrease\" in the number of casualties in Tuesday's revelry, an annual rite that turns the country into a haze-filled battle zone.  \n",
      " \"I think the scare message could have started people to realize that it is not a joke to light firecrackers,\" Reodica said. The government has been airing messages on television showing victims of previous celebrations.  \n",
      " \"There should be a law outlawing firecrackers completely and just allow sparklers,\" said Interior Secretary Robert Barbers.  \n",
      " Still, many Filipinos ignore these warnings.  \n",
      " About 168 persons were injured, including seven from stray bullets, said Reodica in a preliminary report on New Year celebration-related incidents.  \n",
      " Police said a drunken high school teacher shot and killed his neighbor Nathaniel Santos, 37, for exploding firecrackers near his home. The bullet ripped Santos' chest and hit his brother-in-law, Japanese businessman Akira Sakamoto, 38, in the groin, police added.  \n",
      " Police also said two men were stabbed to death Sunday while they were having a drinking session with friends in Minalin town in Pampanga province, north of Manila.  \n",
      " Among the victims was 14-year-old Alfredo Baltazar, who lives outside the army headquarters in suburban Makati. He lost three fingers after picking up an oversized firecracker thrown by a rowdy reveler and which landed on his dinner plate.  \n",
      " A fire believed to be caused by faulty electrical wiring gutted the military's logistics command headquarters in suburban Quezon City. Two soldiers were slightly injured in the incident.  \n",
      " Perhaps no nation greets the new year with more noise than the Philippines.  \n",
      " The tradition of welcoming the new year with fireworks comes from China, but like many customs imported by the Philippines, has been elevated to new flamboyant heights.  \n",
      " Fireworks, Filipinos say, scare away bad luck and bring good fortune. But for many, they also bring injuries. Despite warnings, many revelers defy a ban on large firecrackers and on firing guns into the air at the stroke of midnight.  \n",
      " Even before the official start of the new year, at least one person was killed and 155 injured by firecracker explosions in December, Reodica said.  \n",
      " More casualties are expected after the New Year celebration, usually children hurt by trying to explode stray firecrackers picked up from the street.  \n",
      " There is also usually an upsurge of tetanus infection cases because many people ignore minor injuries caused by firecrackers.  \n",
      " Under Philippine law, firecrackers with more than one-third of a teaspoon of explosives are illegal.  \n",
      " But many fireworks are assembled in unregulated small backyard factories in Bulacan province north of Manila. Although the government legalized the industry several years ago in an attempt to control and tax it, many of the explosives have swelled beyond the maximum legal size.  \n",
      " To limit accidents, the powder is generally mixed by one person working alone in a crude shelter in the middle of an empty field. It then is taken to a table where workers, often children, pack it into wrappers together with cow dung, which controls the burning process.  \n",
      " The cow dung, however, often spreads tetanus to those wounded in firecracker mishaps.  \n",
      " Many vendors display legal-sized firecrackers on stalls but would accommodate buyers who want bigger explosives, which are just hidden from public view.  \n"

      " CHARLESTON, West Virginia -- Both graceful and eerie, massive brick and stone asylums once loomed over towns from Maine to California as the 19th century ideal for humane treatment of America's mentally ill. The idea was for the buildings to resemble fancy hotels, contributing to the patients' cure. Age and neglect have slashed the hundreds of these asylums to about 30, which now face demolition by decay. Preservationists want to restore some for their architectural value, but the cost of just maintaining the huge structures -- let alone renovating them -- is getting in the way.

      " Writer offered a young Barack Obama advice on life \n",
      " HONOLULU -- At key moments in his adolescence, Barack Obama could not turn to a father he hardly knew. Instead, he looked to a left-leaning black journalist and poet for advice on living in a world of black and white. Frank Marshall Davis had his opinions. He once argued that the public schools of his youth prepared neither blacks nor whites for \"life in a multiracial, democratic nation.\" The depth of the influence Davis had on the presumptive Democratic nominee is a question. While Davis' leftist politics could allow the candidate's critics to group Davis with Obama friends and acquaintances with allegedly anti-American views, those who knew Davis and his work say his activism was aimed squarely at social injustice.

      " More than Rushmore: South Dakota road trip \n",
      " CUSTER STATE PARK, South Dakota -- The wild burro wouldn't take no for an answer. We had already encountered grazing pronghorn antelope, packs of wild turkeys, prairie dogs, and enough bison to render us downright blase when yet another of the enormous beasts emerged on our four-day trip through the Black Hills of South Dakota. But the snack-seeking donkeys were a tourist's dream, moseying up to the car window for a bite of carrots, Cheetos or whatever else was handy. The summer vacation was ostensibly a chance to see Mount Rushmore, but we quickly realized that so much more than Rushmore awaited. BC-NA-FEA--US-Rushmore Road Trip. By Alan Scher Zagier.

      "Mexico's economic growth slowed to 1.7 percent in the third quarter but was only mildly affected by turmoil in the world financial markets, officials said Friday. \n",
      " The slowdown is expected to continue for the next six months, but growth could start picking up in the 2nd quarter of 2009, said Miguel Messmacher, the Treasury Department's chief economic planner. \n",
      " Mexico has seen a sharp drop in remittances from citizens living abroad amid the U.S. economic slowdown, and its credit markets squeezed as foreign investors pull assets out to cover losses at home. \n",
      " The country has revised its 2008 growth outlook to 2 percent from 2.4 percent. \n",
      " Messmacher said the Treasury Department is sticking with its 2009 growth forecast of 1.8 percent, even though central bank president Guillermo Ortiz said he expects an expansion between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent. Messmacher said he did not know what criteria the central bank chief had used for his prediction, and could not explain the difference. \n",
      " Both projections are down from an original 3 percent estimate. \n",
      " A Treasury Department report, however, stressed that the global financial meltdown has had a limited impact on the Mexican economy \"partly because the macroeconomic fundamentals of the country have been strengthened in recent years through a disciplined and responsible fiscal policy.\" \n",
      " Employment rates, productivity and public spending \"continue to grow in Mexico, albeit at more moderate annual rates than those observed in previous quarters,\" the report said. \n",
      " A nearly 3 percent growth in the services and electricity sectors led third-quarter economic growth, according to preliminary figures in the report. The mining industry contracted 5.3 percent, while manufacturing and construction also fell slightly. Final third-quarter growth figures are due in November. \n",
      " Mexico's economy grew 2.8 percent in the second quarter. \n",
      " President Felipe Calderon has said Mexico has enough savings and dollar reserves to weather the financial crisis. He has promised $4.4 billion in emergency infrastructure spending next year to spur growth and employment. On Thursday, the government announced it would buy back $3 billion in government bonds to shore up its credit-stressed markets. \n",
      " Messmacher said the government has US$5.6 billion in a stabilization fund that absorbs windfall oil revenue. He said the government is confident it would be able to keep up spending levels next year even if oil prices fall below the US$70 per barrel projected in the 2009 budget, or if oil revenues decline because of a depreciation of the peso. \n",
      " The Mexican peso has lost more than 25 percent of its value since August. \n",
      " The central bank offered $400 million in foreign reserves at three separate auctions Friday, but received no bids, an indication that the peso may be stabilizing after reaching a record low of more than 14 to the dollar recently. It traded at about 12.7 to the dollar Friday.: [15028, 14566, 12030]\n",

      "The army of Southern Sudan has been looting food convoys and carrying out other attacks on aid groups, officials of those groups alleged, and a top military officer warned that the humanitarian groups could be expelled if the complaints get too \"harsh.\" \n",
      " The aid community in Southern Sudan documented 80 incidents of obstruction, vehicle hijackings or harassment of aid staff by southern troops since February. No aid staff have been killed, but several have been wounded. \n",
      " International aid workers are worried that access to needy populations in a region already plagued by hunger may be further restricted as an independence referendum scheduled for January approaches. The vote would determine whether the south splits off from Sudan and forms a separate country. The U.N. says that 4 million people in Southern Sudan -- roughly half the population -- rely on food aid to survive. \n",
      " The Sudan People's Liberation Army, the former rebel group which now forms the army here, denies it is deliberately hindering humanitarian work, but a spokesman acknowledged an incident did occur in Upper Nile state in June in which staffers from the aid group Tearfund were beaten and detained by SPLA soldiers. \n",
      " Army spokesman Lt. Gen.

      " Officials from four aid groups said in recent days that that their work is becoming increasingly dangerous. They said they could not speak out publicly because of fears of reprisals from the government and military. \n",

      "President Kim Young-sam, calling graft an \"endemic Korean disease,\" said Saturday that he will use the investigation of a growing bankruptcy scandal to end corrupt deals in business and politics.  \n",
      " Kim's remark came amid widespread news reports that prosecutors investigating the collapse of South Korea's debt-ridden steel and construction conglomerate Hanbo Group have found enough evidence to charge several legislators with bribery.  \n",
      " Hanbo Steel Industry Co., the flagship company of the nation's No. 14 conglomerate, was declared bankrupt Jan. 23 after accumulating debts of dlrs 6 billion, mostly in loans from government-controlled banks.  \n",
      " Critics and news media say that Hanbo Steel, with only dlrs 105 million in capital, could not have won such huge loans without influence-pedalling from corrupt government officials and politicians.  \n",
      " \"We should use this opportunity to save the country from deep-rooted corruption. Without ending this endemic Korean disease, the country has no future,\" Kim was quoted as saying in a meeting with his senior aides.  \n",
      " The collapse of Hanbo Steel, the nation's No. 2 steel mill, quickly took on political ramifications.  \n",
      " Kim has repeatedly promised to end the entrenched practice of businessmen bribing government officials and politicians in return for favors in public contracts and preferential bank loans. He has put behind bars hundreds of officials and businessmen, including ex-Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, on corruption and other charges.  \n",
      " Opposition parties say the Hanbo scandal is proof that corrupt deals remain business as usual under Kim's rule, and allege involvement by the president's key associates.  \n",
      " They demanded a televised parliamentary hearing and the appointment of a neutral special prosecutor to investigate the scandal _ a demand the government said was politically motivated.  \n",
      " Also Saturday, national news agency Yonhap, quoting unnamed prosecution sources, reported that Chung Tae-soo, head of the Hanbo conglomerate, had bribed at least 15 legislators and government officials for help in getting loans.  \n",
      " Major South Korean newspapers also carried similar reports. Prosecutors refused to confirm them.  \n",
      " Chung, 73, was arrested Friday on charges of bouncing dlrs 328 million in bad checks and corporate notes and illegally drawing dlrs 51 million from a mutual savings company controlled by his conglomerate.  \n",
      " In South Korea, the government controls most banks, protecting them from foreign competition and takeover attempts. Banks often lost heavily when debtor companies went bankrupt, but the government always bailed them out. That practice left banks vulnerable to influence-peddling by politicians.  \n",
      " Also Saturday, Lee Kyong-shik, head of the Bank of Korea, the country's central bank, said South Korean banks' branch offices in Japan and other countries were having \"some\" difficulty in getting loans in the wake of the bankruptcy scandal.  \n",
      " \"But the credibility of the country's banks remains sound,\" Lee told a hastily called news conference.  \n",
      " He added that the banks will supply funds to help their foreign branches.  \n",
      " Hanbo Steel's bankruptcy triggered the collapse of Hanbo's construction, shipbuilding, pharmaceutical and other key subsidiaries.  \n",
      " The chain collapses sent shockwaves through the banking industry. Major banks _ including Korea First Bank, Chohung Bank and Korea Exchange Bank _ were left with huge unpaid loans. Government officials said they would encourage mergers and acquisitions among banks.  \n",

      " The Cardinals made it thrilling at the end, driving from their own 10-yard line to the New York 8 in the final 1:50 before Dave Krieg misfired on four straight passes.  \n",
      " Vencie Glenn of the Giants figured in the two plays that turned back Arizona drives in the fourth quarter, intercepting Cardinals rookie Stoney Case in front of the goal line and running to the Giants 5 with 6:39 to play.  \n",
      " That helped break up Krieg's final pass, aimed at Wendall Gaines in the end zone with 14 seconds remaining.  \n",

      " Greg Davis kicked 44- and 28-yard field goals for the Cardinals (4-9), and Brad Daluiso, who failed on two other attempts, answered with a 51-yard boot _ all in the second quarter.  \n",
      " The Giants had beaten the Cardinals 27-21 in overtime Oct. 8, starting a cycle of overtime every other game for Arizona. This one was close, but after the Giants' touchdown, an extra period was less likely.  \n",
      " From then until the end, the Giants hung on with good defense while Arizona was undone by mistakes. One such mistake was by punter Jeff Feagles, who decided to run for it on fourth-and-5 from his own 30 midway through the third quarter. Phillippi Sparks dashed across the field to tackle him a yard short.  \n",
      " The Giants couldn't capitalize, and Daluiso, who missed a 46-yard field goal in the second quarter, lined up for a 47-yard kick. Eric Swann, who missed the first meeting of the NFC East rivals, blocked it and Jamir Miller recovered.  \n",
      " Then it was the Cardinals' turn.  \n",
      " After a run by Garrison Hearst and a completion, Krieg badly overthrew Frank Sanders, and Thomas Randolph intercepted and returned it 15 yards to the Giants 34.  \n",
      " Case got his first six NFL snaps because Michael Strahan hit Krieg and forced a fumble with 10:46 left in the game. The Cardinals recovered, but Krieg had a stinger in his left arm and had to leave for a series.  \n",
      " Case's first pass went for 19 yards to Larry Centers, and he later ran 4 yards on his first scramble. But on second down he forced a pass into double coverage, and Glenn picked it off at the 2 and returned it 3 yards.  \n",
      " The Cardinals outgained the Giants 94-8 in the first quarter, but came up with nothing.  \n",

      "European regulators are tackling a puzzle that could shift the balance of power on the Internet: Is Google stifling competition by juicing its search results to favor its services over its rivals? \n",
      " Hoping to find an answer, regulators announced an investigation Tuesday that will take the first major look into the heart of Google Inc., focusing on the very thing that corporations from Coca-Cola to KFC go to enormous lengths to keep secret. \n",
      " In Google's case, the mathematical formulas that determine its search engine's prized recommendations. \n",
      " The rankings of Google's results can make or break a business these days, whether it is a blogger or a multibillion dollar company. Knowing how Google makes its decisions, or persuading regulators to dictate changes, could be of enormous value to competitors. \n",
      " Word of the investigation caused Google's stock to tumble $26.40, or 4.5 percent, to close at $555.71. It was the largest one-day drop in the company's shares since mid-July. The company is also dealing with national antitrust probes in Germany, Italy and France. \n",
      " The inquiry's timing also threatens to complicate Google's efforts to expand an empire that will bring in nearly $30 billion in revenue this year. U.S. officials are reviewing its $700 million acquisition of a leading travel technology provider, ITA Software. \n",
      " Perhaps most troubling to Google, the European Commission conceivably could require it to divulge information about the algorithms that decide the links listed at the top of its search results. \n",
      " The Mountain View, California-based company has zealously guarded those formulas in much the same manner as the Coca-Cola Co. protects the recipe for its signature drink or KFC guards the ingredient mix for its chicken. \n",
      " Although any confidential information that Google shares with regulators probably would remain under seal, the company's executives may not want to run the risk of opening its trade secrets to outsiders, Boston University antitrust law professor Keith Hylton said. \n",
      " \"They are probably going to think long and hard about what to do in Mountain View and they may end up saying, 'Let's just cut a deal,'\" Hylton said. \"And that decision may not have anything to do with whether Google is in the right or in the wrong on this issue.\" \n",
      " It's still too early to say whether the commission will ask Google to disclose the algorithms, said Amelia Torres, the spokeswoman for Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia. \n",
      " In a Tuesday statement, Google said it will attempt to answer the commission's questions. \n",
      " If regulators conclude Google acted illegally, the company could face billions of dollars in fines, similar to what Microsoft Corp. and Intel Corp. faced in recent antitrust cases brought by the commission. \n",
      " The investigation marks the first time a government has delved so deeply into Google's core business practices, although there have been other antitrust inquiries that have touched upon the company's dominance of the Internet's lucrative search market. \n",
      " It wouldn't be surprising if the commission's probe spurs similar investigations in the U.S., Hylton said. \"State attorney generals will probably look at this and see an opportunity to get their names on the front pages of newspapers, too,\" he said. \n",
      " Google processes about two of every three search requests on the Web, even though there's nothing to prevent people from using other services, such as Microsoft's Bing and Yahoo Inc., the next two biggest search engines. \n",
      " People have become so addicted to Google in Europe that it commands a 90 percent market share in some countries. \n",
      " The investigation was triggered after several competitors -- U.K.-based price comparison site Foundem, French legal search engine ejustice.fr and shopping site Ciao, owned by Microsoft -- complained that their services were being buried in Google's main search results. \n",
      " The companies also contended that Google highlights its own services, such as online price comparison, in the advertising section of the search results. Google charges other companies to be listed in this prime space. \n",
      " In addition, regulators will look into whether Google tried to prevent other websites in its advertising network from featuring the commercial messages from its rivals. They also want to know whether Google made it more difficult for advertisers to export their information to other online marketing platforms. \n",
      " Several websites in the U.S. have also complained that their links have been unfairly buried in Google's search results and, in some instances, have even filed lawsuits. \n",
      " ICOMP, a business group whose members include Foundem and which is sponsored by Microsoft, said it welcomed the investigation. \n",
      " \"This is not just about search results,\" said ICOMP's legal council David Wood. \"This is about the whole ecosystem of doing business with online content, online advertising companies and software companies.\" \n",
      " The European probe will help underscore the threat posed by Google's market power, said Thomas Barnett, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who oversaw a 2008 investigation that broke up a proposed search partnership between Google and Yahoo in 2008. \n",
      " Barnett, now working to block the ITA Software deal in private practice, predicted the inquiry will delve much deeper into Google's operations. He said no agency has gone after Google the way the European regulators are in their current investigation. \n",
      " Google insists its search decisions are guided by a desire to quickly provide the most relevant and convenient information. \n",
      " \"We built Google for users, not websites,\" Susan Wojcicki and Udi Manber, two of Google's top executives, wrote in a blog post. \"It may seem obvious, but people sometimes forget this -- not every website can come out on top, or even appear on the first page of our results.\" \n",
      " Google's lawyers have also argued the company's website recommendations are a matter of opinion protected by free speech, much like a newspaper's movie reviews or political commentary. \n",
      " \"This investigation could come down to whether Google is a publisher or whether it has become a public utility or some other creature that requires regulatory oversight,\" said Danny Sullivan, editor in chief of SearchEngineLand.com. \n",
      " There's little dispute that Google's own services consistently have ranked at or near the top of its search results. \n",
      " In some cases, there's clear logic to the rankings because some of Google's properties, including its mapping service and YouTube video site, are considered to be among the best and most authoritative in their categories. \n",
      " Other services, such as finance and health, aren't as widely used or as well regarded, but tend to get high rankings in the search results. \n",
      " Although Google says it strives to avoid bias, one of its top executives publicly conceded that the company sometimes give its own services preferential treatment. \n",
      " Marissa Mayer, who formerly helped oversee the search, said the favoritism began shortly after Google introduced its finance section in 2006, according to a June 2007 presentation still available on YouTube ( \n",
      " \"We used to have Yahoo (Finance) first and now Google is first,\" she said. \"... When we rolled out Google Finance, we did put the Google link first. It seems only fair, right, we do all the work for the search page and all these other things, so we did put it first. \n",
      " \"That's actually been our policy since then because of Finance,\" she said. \n",
      " Google's self-interest isn't much different from a lot of companies that publish or broadcast information, Sullivan said. \n",
      " The latest inquiry seems \"like being upset at NBC for showing only NBC shows, even though people tune into NBC because they like the network's programming\" he said. \n",

      "Israel modified the route of its West Bank separation barrier, moving forward with Interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's plan to quickly define the country's final borders as his Kadima Party secured a parliamentary majority. \n",
      " The Israeli Cabinet voted Sunday to reroute an area near the major settlement of Ariel deep in the West Bank and approved putting temporary fencing around areas of Jerusalem abutting the West Bank. The moves will put thousands of Palestinians on the \"Palestinian\" side of the enclosure, officials said. \n",
      " Palestinians said Israel is imposing its will over disputed land and trying to strengthen its claim to sovereignty over Jerusalem. \n",
      " \"We must make a supreme effort to complete the security barrier wherever possible,\" Olmert told the ministers. \"The decisions we take today will allow us to complete the construction of the fence very quickly in critical areas, and therefore improve our ability to thwart attempted attacks.\" \n",
      " Israel began construction of the barrier four years ago, saying it needed to keep suicide bombers out of the country. Olmert says the barrier will serve as the basis for Israel's final border with the West Bank, which Israel won from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war. \n",
      " Olmert, whose Kadima Party won March 28 elections, says he hopes to reach an agreed settlement with the Palestinians but will move forward unilaterally if he concludes there is no negotiating partner on the other side. \n",
      " His Kadima Party signed a coalition deal on Sunday with the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, securing a parliamentary majority, Israeli media reported. Shas, however, has expressed reservations about Olmert's withdrawal plan. \n",
      " Kadima captured 29 seats in the elections and Olmert has since been negotiating with other parties to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament. With Shas on board, the coalition now controls 67 seats. \n",
      " Israel Radio said Olmert was continuing negotiations with other parties and that the new government could be sworn in on Thursday. \n",
      " Shas was noncommittal toward Olmert's withdrawal plan. Shas voters tend to be hawkish, and the party last year opposed Israel's unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. \n",
      " The coalition agreement allows Shas to decide whether to support the evacuation plan once it becomes an item on the government's agenda, the Haaretz daily reported on its Web site. Olmert has previously said his coalition partners would have to accept his plan. \n",
      " Following last month's swearing-in of the Hamas-led Palestinian government, unilateral Israeli action appears increasingly likely. Hamas refuses to recognize Israel's right to exist and to renounce violence, leading to its international isolation and a deepening financial crisis. \n",
      " Hamas ran out of cash following the decision by the United States and European Union _ both of which list Hamas as a terror organization _ to halt hundreds of millions of dollars in direct aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n",

      " \"So much has been written that this is a center for extremist Islamists, but it's totally wrong, we're against violence,\" he said, talking in a stairwell whose door was marked with a sticker saying \"Islam is Peace.\" \n",
      " Not all members of the center are thought to be radicals. But officials maintain that the Muslim community of Ulm and Neu Ulm, as well as Islamic communities across the country, tacitly support extremists by allowing them to pursue their goals without fear of being reported, and sometimes actively helping them. \n",
      " \"Within the community they have a lot of solidarity and loyalty; this is one of Germany's great problems,\" said a senior German intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"There is no support within the communities to help German authorities find radicals.\" \n",
      " Though evidence of the suspected forgery network like faked passports and visas was found at locations in Duesseldorf, Freiburg and Frankfurt, \"our investigation over the last year against this circle centered on Ulm-Neu Ulm and the Multicultural House,\" Hoffmann said in a telephone interview from Munich. \"It is basically a meeting point.\" \n",
      " Investigators' early focus on those connected with the Multicultural House centered on a Sudanese doctor who was suspected of links to extremists but against whom there was never enough evidence to bring charges. \n",
      " Officials said the doctor met in 1998 in the Ulm area with Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, bin Laden's suspected finance chief, only days before Salim's arrest by German authorities on a U.S. warrant. One witness told investigators the doctor had met with Mohamed Atta, lead suicide pilot in the Sept. 11 attacks, but that account has not been confirmed. \n",
      " Salim, 46, was deported and is now in custody in New York awaiting trial on conspiracy charges in the 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 people. He was sentenced to 32 years in prison last year for stabbing a prison guard in the eye with a sharpened comb. \n",
      " His case put authorities on to Syrian-born Mamoun Darkazanli, a Hamburg-based businessman who had power of attorney over one of Salim's bank accounts. Darkazanli has been jailed by German authorities on a Spanish warrant and is fighting extradition on charges he provided al-Qaida logistical help. He denies the charges. \n",
      " Recent focus has been on Egyptian physician Yahia Yousif, who was a target of the Jan. 12 raids but eluded police, Hoffmann said. It is possible Yousif fled after the December arrest of his son, Omar Yousif, on accusations he trained at a military camp of the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba group in Pakistan, which claims to fight Indian forces in Kashmir. \n"

      "Congressional investigators hunting for evidence of a pardons-for-dollars scheme at the Clinton White House got their first look on Wednesday at a list of 150 top donors to his presidential library project.  \n",
      " They looked at the list for about 45 minutes, but lawyers for the House Government Reform Committee would not disclose information about the contributors, or say how many of the names would prompt further investigation. All 150 people and organizations on the list contributed more than $5,000.  \n",
      " The William J. Clinton Foundation, which is raising money for the library to be built in Little Rock, Ark., initially resisted giving the donor list to the committee. The commission chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., then threatened to find foundation director Skip Rutherford in contempt of Congress.  \n",
      " But after several days of negotiations, the foundation and committee agreed on a way for top members of the committee to review the donor list, while protecting the privacy of donors not relevant to the probe.  \n",
      " \"We have worked out an agreement, and Mr. Rutherford will not be required to testify\" on Thursday, Burton said. \"We think we'll have all the information we want by Friday, specific contributors, the amount and the dates. We've excused some of them because we don't think the information is necessary at this time.\"  \n",
      " Among other things, the committee wants to know whether Clinton's decision to pardon fugitive Marc Rich was influenced by contributions to the library. Rich, a billionaire, has lived in Switzerland since just before he was indicted in 1983 on charges of tax evasion, fraud and making illegal oil deals with Iran.  \n",
      " His ex-wife, songwriter Denise Rich, contributed $450,000 to the foundation, $1.1 million to the Democratic Party and at least $109,000 to Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the Senate. Denise Rich and her friend, Beth Dozoretz, a former finance chairman for the Democratic National Committee who pledged to raise $1 million for the library project, have both refused to testify before the committee.  \n",
      " The committee was forcing Dozoretz to attend Thursday's hearing to publicly refuse to testify.  \n",
      " While Rutherford is no longer required to testify, the committee expected to hear from other witnesses, including John Podesta, Clinton's former chief of staff; Beth Nolan, former White House counsel; Bruce Lindsey, former aide and longtime Clinton confidant; and Lewis Libby, a lawyer who is chief of staff for Vice President Dick Cheney and once represented Rich.  \n",
      " On Wednesday, the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the pardon powers of the president and whether the clemency process needs to be improved.  \n",
      " Margaret Colgate Love, who served as pardon attorney at the Justice Department from 1990 to 1997, told the committee that from the beginning of his presidency, Clinton moved to take away the agency's traditional role of being the first to review pardon requests.  \n",
      " \"The final Clinton pardons were an accident waiting to happen,\" she said.  \n",
      " Traditionally, presidents let the Justice Department take the first look at clemency requests, but Clinton's White House answered pardon inquiries, and made it known that Justice officials would be among many people who would advise Clinton on the requests, she said.  \n",
      " \"The Clinton administration's shortsighted and ill-advised decision to abandon the long-standing regular system of Justice Department review led directly to the reported free-for-all at the end of his term and the resultant appearance of cronyism and influence-peddling,\" Love asserted.: [19042, 18887, 14593]\n",

      "President Vicente Fox said Tuesday a majority of 12 years of killings against women in Ciudad Juarez had been solved, again angering activists and victims' family members still fuming over his suggestion the slayings had been blown out of proportion. \n",
      " Speaking to reporters in this northern industrial city, Fox said there have been 323 women killed in Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas, since 1993 and added that 230 cases have been solved. \n",
      " \"It's important that people know ... that 200 of the killers are in prison,\" the president said. \"This shows the work done so far, but we're aware there are still other cases that need to be solved.\" \n",
      " The tallies he was referring to appear in a report presented in January by Maria Lopez Urbina, special federal prosecutor in charge of the Juarez cases. \n",
      " Fox's government announced Monday that Lopez Urbina had been replaced for reasons that were not clear. The conclusions reached in her final report were widely criticized by human rights groups, who said the figures don't add up. \n",
      " His comments in Monterrey came a day after Fox said a majority of the cases had been solved and the perpetrators incarcerated, but that the media preferred to sensationalize the cases, only focusing on the negative and tarnishing Ciudad Juarez's image. \n",
      " \"It's really surprising that the media only pays attention to security problems but it doesn't pay attention when the criminals are detained,\" the president said Monday. \"The great majority of the cases (in Ciudad Juarez) have been solved and those responsible are behind bars and if someone has proof to the contrary he should come forward.\" \n",
      " Evangelina Arce, whose daughter Silvia has been missing since 1998, traveled Tuesday from Juarez to Monterrey to protest the president's comments. \n",
      " \"We're here to ask for a meeting with the president to show him the proof he's asking for,\" said Arce, who held her daughter's photo and was accompanied by three other women waving banners as the presidential convoy rolled past. \n",
      " Fox's comments both days enraged many in Juarez and beyond who say far more women were killed than the government is willing to acknowledge and many of those arrested for the crimes were tortured into confessing. \n",
      " Authorities in the state of Chihuahua, where Juarez is located, say about 340 women have been killed since 1993 in Juarez. \n",
      " A lot of the women were slain in domestic abuse or drug-related cases disputes, but at least 100 fell victim to slayings that appear to fit a pattern where a young, slender woman was sexually assaulted, strangled, and dumped in the desert outside the city of 1.3 million. \n",
      " Esther Chavez, a longtime activist and director of Casa Amiga, a nonprofit center that helps rape and abuse victims in Juarez, called Fox's comments \"irresponsible\" and \"contradictory.\" \n",
      " \"If the cases have been solved, why does the federal government keep sending people to work on the investigations?\" Chavez asked, pointing out a new federal special prosecutor and 30 more federal investigators have been assigned to the Juarez cases. \n",

      " \"To be honest with you,\" he said, \"I don't really know how I was able to win today's match. I really don't.\"  \n",
      " In truth, neither did most of the U.S. Open crowd or the man on the other side of the net, Vince Spadea, who served for the match in the fourth set Saturday, only to be broken in the game and in spirit by Chang's indomitable will.  \n",
      " Chang, the ultimate tennis survivor, looked as if he could barely lift his feet between points, yet on and on he scrambled until he wore down Spadea and secured a 6-4, 5-7, 2-6, 7-5, 6-3 victory in 3 hours, 50 minutes of mutual punishment.  \n",
      " In a week at the Open when defending champion Pete Sampras struggled to win a five-setter and 1994 champion Andre Agassi had to fend off a hot player in four sets, Chang had the closest call of all.  \n",

      " Third-seeded Thomas Muster romped at night, beating Sergi Bruguera 6-2, 6-4, 6-3. No. 13 Thomas Enqvist also won in straight sets against Pablo Campana. Alex O'Brien, a giant-killer most of the summer, finally lost to David Wheaton, 1-6, 7-5, 6-1, 6-2.  \n",

      " In heat as fierce as a day in the desert, Chang and Spadea slugged thousands of balls from the baseline in one long rally after another, the momentum of the match shifting with each tiny surge of confidence by one or the other.  \n",
      " Spadea, a 22-year-old ranked No. 69, had lost to Chang twice before and was blanked 6-0 against him in the final set of a match a month ago in Washington.  \n",
      " Pouncing confidently on Chang's second serves all day _ Chang converted an atrocious 35 percent of his first serves in the match _ Spadea served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set after breaking Chang when he slapped three unforced errors.  \n",
      " Spadea had been playing loosely and aggressively, going for winners, coming in often to punch volley winners. Then, just at that moment, nerves and weariness seized Spadea.  \n",
      " \"He raised his level, and I didn't get too many serves in, didn't attack, didn't hit my shots the way I had been to get to that point,\" Spadea said.  \n",
      " Chang broke Spadea at love, winning the first point on a backhand volley, and taking the second on a backhand long by Spadea. Chang drilled a forehand into the corner for the third point, then put the game away with a backhand volley that clipped the net cord and trickled over. Spadea scurried after it, but could only dump it into the net.  \n",
      " \"I know in all matches that I play, if I'm down a match point, and a guy is serving for it, I don't count myself out,\" Chang said. \"If I count myself out mentally, I'm going to lose for sure.\"  \n",
      " After that big break at love, Chang held at love, then pushed Spadea to love-40 with a crisp backhand crosscourt. Chang had put together 11 straight points, and Spadea looked desperate and defeated.  \n",
      " Yet Spadea held off two match points before yielding on the third with his biggest blunder of the match _ a low-percentage drop shot from the baseline that fell flat against the net cord.  \n",
      " As the fifth set began, nearly three hours into the match, Chang looked in control. But the appearance proved deceiving as Spadea summoned up the strength to come back, and Chang began cramping and wilting in the heat.  \n",
      " Spadea, indeed, was too good for most of the first four sets, and he was too good for Chang once more when he broke him to 2-1 in the fifth set, putting it back on serve.  \n",
      " After an exchange of serves to 3-2, Chang managed one more break, when Spadea followed up his sixth ace with a long forehand.  \n",
      " At 40-0 in the final game, Spadea stabbed a backhand volley, and Chang fell flat on his belly trying to switch directions to go for it. He lay there a moment, his soaking shirt leaving a wet spot on the court, then got up and put the match away with a backhand pass. With that last shot, Chang turned his head skyward in sheer relief.  \n"

      "It's called the \"snow eater.\" A heavy, warm wind blowing in from the Japan Sea that could both signal the beginning of spring, and a disaster for the Olympics.  \n",
      " And though Nagano's weather seems to finally be cooperating with Olympic organizers, potential problems like the snow eater are keeping forecasters on constant alert.  \n",
      " \"This will be a real test of our skills,\" Hiromichi Ito, the chief weather forecaster for the games, said Sunday. \"There are special difficulties with each venue.\"  \n",
      " Ito's 45-person weather team is armed with possibly the most high-tech arsenal of forecasting gear ever used at a Winter Olympics. They will be manning it round the clock until the Feb. 7-22 games are over.  \n",
      " At their command is state-of-the-art Doppler radar like that used in the movie \"Twister,\" lasar equipment for observing cloud formations and a highly advanced on-line information system.  \n",
      " Weather forecasters will be deployed to each venue, and a supercomputer will be employed to crunch all the numbers into usuable data fast enough for race officials to decide whether a day's competition should be called off.  \n",
      " Although snows came to Nagano a bit later than usual this year, Ito said there is now more than 2 meters (six feet) of it on the men's downhill skiing course and between 1-1.65 meters (3-5 1/2 feet) on the other outdoor venues.  \n",
      " He said a cold front will likely bring in more snow to the mountains surrounding Nagano in the coming days.  \n",
      " \"There is absolutely no concern that there won't be enough snow for the competitions,\" he said.  \n",
      " Bernhard Russi, who designed the downhill course, said he is happy to see it covered in white.  \n",
      " \"I am relieved that there was enough snow because Olympics are never fun when there is not enough,\" Russi said.  \n",
      " But Ito noted that all the focus on snow might be misguided.  \n",
      " Because of its altitude high up the side of Mount Karamatsu, the men's downhill course tends to stick up into the clouds _ making it vulnerable to fog-like conditions.  \n",
      " Winds can also be very strong, and the difference between weather conditions on the bottom and top of the course quite striking. It can, in fact, be sunny at the bottom of the course while a blizzard blows at the top.  \n",
      " \"Behind the venue are the 3,000-meter (10,000-foot) Japan Alps,\" he said. \"Weather patterns moving in from the west can be amplified by the mountains. Winds can be strengthened because of the local topography.\"  \n",
      " And the dreaded snow eater, though usually coming later, has been known to come in February.  \n",
      " Along with the downhill and other skiing sites, Ito said detailed local forecasts will be made for the indoor venues, including such sports as figure skating and ice hockey.  \n",
      " \"The sports themselves are indoors, but the weather outside can be crucial to those responsible for transportation or crowd control,\" he said.  \n",
      " Nagano is the fathest south the Winter Olympics have ever come. It is located at about the same latitude as San Francisco, California and farther south than 1992 Summer Olympics host Barcelona.  \n",
      " \"We believe this is about the farthest south the games could be held in Japan with natural snow,\" Ito said.  \n",
      " But he added that hasn't been a problem.  \n",
      " \"We have low temperatures and are able to use both natural and man-made snow,\" he said. \"So the conditions are good.\"  \n",
      " He also said the El Nino warming pattern that has altered weather elsewhere this year was never really an issue for Nagano.  \n",
      " \"We were never particularly worried about El Nino,\" he said. \"We have observed El Nino in past years, but it has never meant there wasn't enough snow for skiing.\" (et): [18452, 18380, 16939]\n",

      "Documents and an audio tape released by a Washington-based non-governmental research group showed U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was anxious for his aides to \"get right on top of it\" in support of a 1964 military coup in Brazil. \n",
      " The documents were released Wednesday by the National Security Archive on its Web site to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the coup, which led to 21 years of military rule in Brazil. The group is a non-governmental foreign policy documentation center. \n",
      " The audio tape presents a March 31, 1964 briefing between Johnson and Undersecretary of State George Ball. Ball offered \"a quick run-down on the situation in Brazil,\" then suggested sending a naval task force to the South Atlantic and loading tankers with fuel in case the Brazilian coup plotters needed U.S. support. \n",
      " Johnson replied, saying, \"Put anyone with any imagination and ingenuity onto it. We just can't take this one. I'd get right on top of it and stick my neck out a little.\" \n",
      " On March 31, 1964 Brazilian army units in two states mobilized troops for the declared purpose of deposing leftist President Joao Goulart. On April 1, units in the rest of Brazil's 22 states joined the movement. \n",
      " The generals alleged that Goulart, a firebrand lawyer backed by the nation's labor movement, was planning Communist-style rule for Brazil. \n",
      " Goulart fled to Uruguay on April 4. For more than two decades after that, Brazil was ruled by a string of five colorless military presidents chosen by their fellow officers. The dictatorship ended in 1985 when a popular movement for re-democratization swept the country. \n",
      " Some of the documents were declassified as recently as five weeks ago, said Peter Kornbluh, a researcher at the archive. \"They were not disseminated in the United States until today (Wednesday),\" Kornbluh told the Associated Press in a telephone interview. \"They show LBJ giving the green light to U.S. national security officials to make sure the coup succeeded.\" \n",
      " The documents include cables from U.S. Ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon seeking \"a clandestine delivery of arms\" for use by Brazilian military plotters in the days leading up to the coup. He also sought U.S. supplies of fuel for the Brazilian armed forces. \n",
      " Kornbluh said, \"A lot about the U.S. and the 1964 Brazilian coup still remains secret.\" \n",
      " Brazilian and U.S. officials were unavailable for comment on the materials. \n",
      " Marshall Eakin, a Brazilian history professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee said Brazil's military dictatorship \"was very definitely a Cold War-inspired thing.\" \n",
      " \"It's interesting that there are more records about Brazilian history in U.S. archives than in Brazil,\" Eakin said. \"Often, Brazilian historians go to the U.S. to do their research.\" \n",
      " The coup itself was bloodless, but a wave of student demonstrations in 1968 led to a crackdown that year in which the country's military rulers introduced systematic imprisonment and torture of political opponents. Those abuses, in turn, prompted creation of a Brazilian human rights movement, led by the Roman Catholic archbishop of Sao Paulo, Cardinal Paulo Evaristo Arns. \n",
      " Now 83 and retired, Arns said Wednesday, \"We will never know everything about the abuses committed by the Brazilian military in the name of national security. My guess is that, someday, we'll know 10 percent, but 90 percent will remain forever shrouded in mystery.\"       _  _  _\t= \n",

      " Airing the tape  _  which NBC said was filmed but never broadcast by Iraqi television  _  created a sense of fear, anxiety and hurt, Piestewa's family said in a statement. \n",

      " NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin said the network contacted the Pentagon so the families of Piestewa and Lynch would know about the footage. \n",
      " \"Undeniably there's news value in it,\" Levin said, because it bolsters Lynch's statements that she did not remember what happened after her unit was attacked, and because it shows Piestewa was alive for a time after the ambush. \n",
      " \"It gave some clarity to the situation,\" Levin said. \n",
      " On the tape, Piestewa's face is swollen, bloody and bruised and her head loosely bandaged. Her lip is shown curling back in an apparent grimace. \n",
      " Lynch, 20, is also shown bandaged, her lip cut. Neither appears awake or alert. \n",
      " The footage was somewhat comforting for fellow former POW Spc. Shoshana Johnson, who verified Lynch's and Piestewa's identities for NBC. \n",
      " \"It was a little shocking to see Lori, but it also gave me a little peace to know that they tried, they did their best for her,\" Johnson, 30, told the network. \"I mean, it was obvious they tried to bandage her up and give her medical care.\" \n",
      " Iraqi doctors have previously said the women were brought to a private clinic after the ambush, and that Piestewa, a 23-year-old mother of two from Tuba City, Arizona, died half an hour later of severe head injuries. \n",

      " Still, the world is changing fast around Monaco. Its French neighbors now belong to a 25-nation European Union bent on eradicating old anomalies. To survive, it is likely to need a tough-minded ruler. \n",
      " For many close to the inner circle, such as Nadia Lacoste, Albert is plainly up to the job. Lacoste was palace spokeswoman in the heady days of Princess Grace, the actress Grace Kelly, who died in 1982. \n",
      " \"Albert will be a wonderful prince,\" she told The Associated Press. \"On his own, he'll show a dynamic personality and effective leadership.\" \n",

      " Still no bigger than Central Park, with a population of 32,000 that includes only 7,000 citizens, Monaco grew by 20 percent on land reclaimed by sinking pilings deep in the Mediterranean. \n",
      " A euro270 million (US$328 million) floating breakwater expanded the harbor capacity by a third, allowing luxury cruise ships to dock. \n",

      " France has urged Monaco to crack down on money laundering, and EU authorities have pressed for a loosening of bank secrecy.

      " All her adult life, she has been a housewife. Now, at age 52, Ramovic has her first paid job: She is a `sherpa,' one of the mountain guides and porters who carries goods into the capital on foot.  \n",
      " Since Serb gunners started besieging Sarajevo in 1992, the only route linking the city with the outside world has been a narrow road over Mount Igman, exposed to Serb fire day and night.  \n",
      " The latest victim on that deadly 800-yard stretch died Sunday: Ramovic's neighbor, Hilmo Cilpa, a Bosnian government driver.  \n",
      " \"His brain was all over the place. An anti-aircraft bullet blew his head off,\" she said, with the matter-of-fact weapons knowledge acquired by all Sarajevans after three years of death and destruction.  \n",
      " The alternative to such danger is the slippery, dusty path, a winding track carved by water streaming the slope down when snow melts. Broken backpacks and smashed eggs scattered along the side testify to earlier falls. There are no trees and snipers are usually just out of range.  \n",
      " Serb artillery on either side targets the road nearby.  \n",
      " Sherpas meet vehicles from the outside world at the top of the path on the mountain. After a short negotiation, they head off on foot, taking goods on the 20-30 minute trek down the mountain. The drivers head in the opposite direction, back to safety.  \n",
      " Picking her way between the hulls of trucks that skidded off the narrow mountain road after being shot at, Ramovic is fast, dispensing safety tips all the way down.  \n",
      " On Saturday, when fierce fighting erupted across northern Bosnia and around Sarajevo, she and her colleague, 13-year-old Amer Huskic, crouched behind rocks to dodge fire.  \n",
      " \"They're shooting from that place close to the U.N. flag there, you see?\" Ramovic said, pointing to a pre-war secondary school which now houses a 20-mm anti-aircraft weapon.  \n",
      " The gun was well inside the 12.5-mile-wide weapons-free zone that is supposed to protect the capital.  \n",
      " From the mountain, Sarajevo looks deceptively peaceful in the spring sunshine, if you can ignore the occasional burst of heavy machine-gun fire.  \n",
      " Ramovic watched a white U.N. plane touch down at the airport, formally controlled by the United Nations. An hour earlier, a similar plane had bought in special envoy Yasushi Akashi, who was trying to extend a cease-fire that Ramovic says she never noticed.  \n",
      " \"This is a good time to go,\" Ramovic said. \"While (Akashi) is here, (the guns) will shut up. When he leaves, don't go. Get into a shelter.\"  \n",
      " Important foreign visitors often quiet the guns, but Serb fire picks up soon as they leave, she said.  \n",
      " With two sons in the Bosnian army and her husband ill, Ramovic is the family's sole source of income.  \n",
      " \"I lost six members of my family. I cried, cried and then I let it go. I live. Others live too and they need food. Nobody else in my family can work now, but I can,\" she said.  \n"

      " Sorenstam was not one of them.  \n",

      " \"She's at that stage where you really don't want to ask,\" Kuehn said.  \n",
      " Both shot a 79, although Kuehn provided a scare when she doubled over on the 11th tee because of a contraction.  \n",
      " Then there was Kathleen Robinson, whose career-low round was the 72 she had to qualify. She was no match for Pine Needles, making the turn in 50 and winding up with an 88.  \n",
      " After a bizarre round that featured sunshine and swirling wind that gave way to brief showers late in the afternoon, two names at the top were a little surprising.  \n",
      " Eathorne, a former Canadian Amateur champion, hardly brought a U.S. Open-type game to Pine Needles. Only half of her tee shots found the fairway, and she missed nine greens. Still, she found the secret to scoring is a good putter, and Eathorne sure had that.  \n",
      " She took only 24 putts, including a 20-footer for birdie on the tough 17th and another 20-footer to save par on the final hole for the 67.  \n",
      " \"I don't think I left any out there,\" Eathorne said. \"I made a couple of real good 20-footers for par, and making those 5-footers is even harder.\"  \n",
      " Figg-Currier was another unlikely leader, especially since she has missed the cut in eight of her previous 11 Women's Opens, and has never finished higher than a tie for 26th.  \n",
      " She missed only three fairways, which she feels is just as essential as putting.  \n",
      " \"The Donald Ross design requires you to think off the tee,\" she said. \"You have to manage your game the best you can.\"  \n",
      " Sorenstam was best at managing her circumstances.  \n",
      " After five wins in her first 10 events, a landmark 59 in women's golf and a victory at the first major of the year, Sorenstam was never more confident coming into a U.S. Open. The first few holes could have made her think otherwise.  \n",
      " Starting on No. 10, she had mud on her ball that made her second shot squirt sideways and clip a tree. Her drive on 11 landed in a divot.  \n",
      " She finally paid for the bad luck on No. 14. Her drive landed in the rough on a knoll, leaving her feet about 30 inches below the ball. She tried to hit a 5-iron, but slipped during her swing. She opened the face of the club, and the ball shot sideways about 30 yards.  \n",
      " From under a tree, she hit short of the green, chipped to 12 feet and made double bogey.  \n",
      " Throughout the round, Sorenstam was between clubs as she tried to gauge a course that wasn't as hard and fast as it appeared, and swirling winds that confused her. During one seven-hole stretch, she had five birdie putts no closer than 40 feet.  \n",
      " What saved her round was a 60-footer on No. 17. After lagging beautifully throughout the round, she charged this one 8 feet by and risked going 3 over. Instead, she curled it in for par.  \n",
      " \"After the first putt, I told myself to pay attention to where I am,\" she said. \"When I made that putt, it put me in a different mindset.\"  \n",
      " She skipped to the hole and pumped her fist after a 15-foot birdie on No. 3 to get back to even, realizing that such opportunities would be rare. Clearly, Pine Needles was no place to shoot 59.  \n",
      " \"It seems like all year I've had birdie chances of 8-to-15 feet on 12 or 13 holes every round,\" Sorenstam said. \"Today, I'd be surprised if I had six like that.\"  \n",

      " The centenarians could be fitted into 19 groups with different genetic signatures, they found. Some genes correlate with longer survival, others delayed the onset of various age-related diseases such as dementia. \n",
      " \"The signatures show different paths of longevity,\" Sebastiani said. \n",
      " In general, the centenarians remained in good health longer than average, not developing diseases associated with old age until in their 90s, according to the study. \n",
      " The researchers were surprised, Sebastiani said, that they found little difference between the centenarians and the control group in genetic variations that predispose people to certain illnesses. \n",
      " \"We found that what predisposes to a long life is not lack of disease associated variants, but the presence of protective variants,\" she said at a briefing. \n",
      " In addition, 40 percent of \"super-centenarians\" aged 110 and over had three specific genetic variants in common. \n",
      " Perls cautioned that this is a very complex genetic puzzle and \"we're quite a ways away, still, in understanding what pathways are governed by these genes.\" \n",
      " \"I look at the complexity of this puzzle and feel very strongly that this will not lead to treatments that will get people to be centenarians,\" he said. But it may help in developing a strategy and screenings that will help find what treatments will be needed down the road. \n",
      " While this study, begun in 1995, focused on Caucasians, the researchers said they plan to extend it to other groups, including studying Japan, which has large numbers of elderly. \n",

      " The 77 percent accuracy rate reported in this study is better than other groups have been able to do, Kendler added. \n",
      " The U.S. study found that about 85 percent of people 100 and older are women and 15 percent men. \n",
      " \"Men tend to be more susceptible to mortality in age-related diseases,\" Perls said. \"Once they get a disease they more readily die. Women, on the other hand, seem to be better able to handle these diseases, so they tend to have higher levels of disability than men, but they live longer than men.\" \n",

      " Four days before he was to enter the ring for the second time since his release from prison for rape, Tyson said Tuesday night he has a fractured right thumb.  \n",
      " The injury forced Saturday night's fight to be called off and will sideline the former champion four to six weeks.  \n",

      " \"The break is in the thumb between the main joint and the tip of the thumb,\" said Marrone, who confirmed the injury would take up to six weeks to heal.  \n",

      " It was to have been Tyson's first appearance on commercial television since he knocked out Marvis Frazier in 30 seconds on July 11, 1986. In his last fight, on Aug. 19, he knocked out McNeeley in 89 seconds, a laughably one-sided bout that drew waves of protest from the pay-per-view audience.  \n",

      " If indeed it is a postponement, it will be the fourth in Tyson's career. He also has had one cancellation.  \n",
      " Tyson was to have defended the undisputed title against Bruno in September 1988, but was in an auto accident, The fight didn't take place until Feb. 25, 1989, when Tyson stopped Bruno in the fifth round.  \n",
      " He was supposed to defend the title against Razor Ruddock in November 1989 in Canada but pulled out because of illness. Instead, he fought Buster Douglas in February 1990 and was stopped in the 10th round in a huge upset.  \n",
      " Tyson later fought Ruddock twice in 1991, winning both bouts.  \n",
      " The other postponement came when Tyson had to pull out of a fight against Alex Stewart set for September 1990 because of a cut eye. He fought Stewart on Dec. 8 of that year and stopped him in the first round.  \n",
      " The canceled bout was one scheduled for Nov. 8, 1991, against Evander Holyfield, then the undisputed champion. Tyson pulled out Oct. 18 when he suffered a rib injury in training.  \n"

      "Robert Congel always thinks big, as would befit a founder of a company called Pyramid. However, his latest proposal sort of boggles the mind.  \n",
      " Congel wants to triple the size of Carousel Center here, transforming it into the largest mall in the country -- bigger even than Minnesota's Mall of America, now a major tourist attraction. He's putting before city and Onondaga County lawmakers a proposal to spend $900 million to expand the mall to 4.5 million square feet.  \n",
      " \"There will be nothing like this in the world if we're able to put even 75 percent of what we think we can put together here,\" Congel said. \"And I think we will. There are a lot of things going on right now to make this happen.\"  \n",
      " Pyramid, which built and opened Carousel Center nearly a decade ago, is proposing an indoor-resort tourist destination, filled with entertainment of Disney proportions.  \n",
      " It would include: a four-level aquarium aimed at giving visitors the sense they're in the ocean, hockey rinks, family sporting and entertainment centers, a golf dome and indoor soccer fields; upscale shopping and restaurants; and four hotels. A lush, landscaped atrium would include a public water \"park\" with wading and swimming areas and a waterfall.  \n",
      " The addition would be built in two phases. Phase One construction would begin in the fall or next spring, and construction on Phase Two would begin when Phase One opens. The first phase would cost $300 million to build and cover 780,225 square feet.  \n",
      " If approved, Pyramid will get tax-exempt borrowing to pay for infrastructure improvements for the property, including roads, multi-level parking decks and underground parking that would be owned by the city but maintained by Pyramid. The $250 million for these infrastructure improvements would be repaid over 30 years, with annual payments in lieu of taxes (PILOTs) of $11.3 million going directly toward that debt.  \n",
      " Although the city and county would forgo full property taxes, they would share in the additional sales tax revenue from the expanded mall, which Pyramid executives and city and county officials who have studied the plans estimate at $89 million a year.  \n",
      " Millions more dollars would ripple out of the giant mall-resort, Pyramid says, with mall employment increasing from 3,100 jobs to 11,150 jobs, plus 8,200 construction jobs to build the addition.  \n",
      " The company says a resort of the size projected will draw visitors from as far as four hours away to stay overnight. Pyramid's studies and projections, based on mall customer trends, say the mall-resort would draw 35 million visitors a year, with 75 percent of them coming from outside Onondaga County.  \n",
      " In 1999, Carousel Center drew 17 million shoppers, with just under half coming from outside the county, according to Pyramid.  \n",
      " Congel said the hotels also would be a draw for the downtown convention center, and would give the community enough rooms to draw events like the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament.  \n",
      " A study commissioned by the city has said an entertainment-themed expansion of the mall would jump-start the economy and make Syracuse's Inner Harbor a tourist destination.  \n",
      " Without the PILOT, Congel and other Pyramid executives say, the expansion will not be built. And Congel wants an answer in May.  \n",
      " \"The PILOT is what will make it go,\" said Onondaga County Executive Nicholas Pirro, who has been briefed about Pyramid's plans and proposals. Pirro said there's little reason for the project not to go ahead, considering the promise of thousands of jobs and a massive construction project creating a major resort that will attract tourists and their money.  \n",
      " \"When you try to define yourself as a community,\" Pirro said, \"we can either go along status quo or we can look to a major change for our future. We can either take advantage of that or stay where we are. Most people, I think, would like to take a step forward ... to increase the viability of this community.\": [5487, 5484, 5362]\n",

      "Heightened activity detected by spy satellites around a North Korean nuclear plant has American intelligence analysts in disagreement: Is the reclusive communist government rushing to produce nuclear weapons or just bluffing? \n",
      " Throughout January, U.S. spy satellites have detected covered trucks apparently taking on cargo at the nuclear storage facility at Yongbyon, where spent nuclear fuel rods are stored, U.S. officials said Friday on condition of anonymity. When processed, enough plutonium could be extracted from the rods to make four or five nuclear weapons. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has said there are 8,000 rods. \n",
      " White House spokesman Ari Fleischer would not comment on the intelligence, but warned Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, against taking \"another provocative step\" that \"further isolates North Korea from the international community.\" \n",
      " Immersed in planning for a possible war against Iraq, the Bush administration has played down Korean developments of recent months even as North Korea continued to ratchet up the tension. \n",
      " The top U.S. military commander in the Pacific has asked for about 2,000 more troops, mostly Air Force personnel, to join 37,000 already in South Korea, CBS News reported. \n",
      " There is a broadening consensus in the administration that the reclusive communist regime is moving quickly down the path toward developing nuclear weapons, one senior defense official said. At the same time, another said that because North Koreans know they're being watched, Pyongyang is also suspected of maneuvering to force Americans to the bargaining table. \n",
      " \"The fact that they've done this in broad daylight, as it were, suggests to me that this is part of the brinksmanship with the United States,\" said Kurt Campbell, an Asia specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a policy adviser at the Pentagon during the Clinton administration. \n",
      " \"I think they're playing with fire,\" he said. \"Even though the administration has feigned nonchalance, the reality is that tampering with plutonium that could be shipped or smuggled is extraordinarily serious, and, I would argue, crosses a very clear and bright red line.\" \n",
      " Officials say they don't really know what North Korea is up to at the long-shuttered plant, which is north of Pyongyang. \n",
      " It is possible that the trucks moving there over recent weeks are loading spent fuel rods, either to be stored elsewhere or in preparation for processing, one official said. \n",
      " More people have been working at the complex, including grading roads, signs that the regime in Pyongyang is resuming operations. \n",
      " The activity is not particularly unexpected, since the Koreans withdrew from a global anti-nuclear pact and said they would restart the reactor at Yongbyon to generate electricity. \n",
      " But restarting it would be another ominous step in a crisis that has been escalating since October. \n",
      " Under President Bill Clinton, the United States drew up plans to bomb Yongbyon in 1994 over possible North Korean weapons activities. That crisis was defused with an energy deal under which Pyongyang agreed to mothball the facility in return for oil shipments and construction of less threatening nuclear power plants by a consortium of the United States, Japan and South Korea. \n",
      " The agreement collapsed in October when the United States said North Korea had acknowledged developing nuclear weapons in violation of the 1994 agreement. Washington suspended the fuel shipments. And North Korea, in turn, expelled U.N. inspectors in December, got rid of surveillance cameras and began moving out from storage new fuel rods needed to restart a 5-megawatt reactor, the smaller of two reactors at the complex. \n",
      " While there is agreement in the intelligence community that North Korea is gearing up at Yongbyon, there is disagreement not only about the ultimate goal but on how far along they've moved, officials said. \n",
      " Some intelligence officials believe the North could restart a reactor by the end of February. \n",
      " On the stored spent rods, analysts say, it could take a couple of months to remove the plutonium and weeks or months to turn the plutonium into bombs. \n",
      " Analysts say North Koreans may want the weapons for two reasons: to export for much-needed revenue and to keep for their own use. Also, Pyongyang has been incensed by President Bush's description of the country as part of an \"axis of evil\" with Iraq and Iran and has demanded assurances it will not be attacked. \n",
      " \"I think they are trying to signal the United States and go to the edge,\" Campbell said. \"And the Bush administration is trying to pretend they don't care, but they're desperately caring.\" \n",
      " Some U.S. officials believe North Korea already has one or two nuclear weapons, as well as extensive chemical and biological weapons capabilities.\t  _  _\t_ \n"

      "Setting aside bitterness over a bloody naval clash, North Korea congratulated South Korea on its success in reaching the semifinals in the soccer World Cup, the communist country's media reported. \n",
      " The chief of North Korea's Football Association, Ri Gwang Gun, lauded South Korea's spectacular run in the World Cup in a letter sent to his South Korean counterpart, Chung Mong-joon, the North's Korean Central News Agency reported Sunday. \n",
      " The letter compared South Korea's unexpected advance to the semifinals of world soccer's showcase tournament to the success of North Korea in the 1966 World Cup in London, in which the North Koreans reached the quarterfinals after upsetting Italy. \n",
      " \"The successive successes made by your football team in the wake of the victory achieved by our eleven in the London soccer championships held in 1966 which stunned the world are a victory common to the nation which convinces the fellow countrymen that they can defeat any strong team in the world and emerge the strongest if they have a will,\" KCNA quoted the letter as saying. \n",
      " \"This, at the same time, instills into the nation the confidence that they can achieve the independent reunification of the country more smoothly if they pool efforts and wisdom,\" the letter reportedly said. \n",
      " South Korea, which had never scored a win in the five past World Cups, topped Group D of this year's event after beating Poland and Portugal and drawing with the United States. \n",
      " In the knockout rounds, the South Koreans also bested Italy and Spain and reached the final four, where they lost to Germany. That made South Korea the first Asian team to reach the semifinals at a World Cup. \n",
      " North Korea stayed away from this year's World Cup. It did not take part in a regional qualifying event and rejected repeated South Korean offers to host one or two matches. \n",
      " Sunday's conciliatory gesture by North Korean came a day after the navies of the two rival countries fought a gun battle near their western sea border. \n",
      " One South Korean patrol boat sank, killing four sailors and wounding 19 others. One was listed as missing. South Korean military officials believed that North Korea also lost about 30 sailors. \n",
      " South Korea blamed North Korea for the clash, while North Korea claimed that South Korean sailors fired first. \n",
      " The Koreas were divided in 1945. The 1950-53 Korean War ended in a fragile armistice, not in a permanent peace treaty. Today they share the world's most heavily armed border, with nearly 2 million troops deployed on both sides.: [18448, 18107, 14736]\n",

      "The British economy is poised for strong growth into 2005, raising the possibility of an interest rate hike early in the new year, according to a study published Monday. \n",
      " The BDO Business Trends Report said that businesses are upbeat because of strong consumer spending. Its optimism index, a leading indicator of growth for the two quarters ahead, increased to 102.2 in October _ a four-year peak. \n",
      " The index implies an annualized growth 3.6 percent in the second quarter. \n",
      " The output index fell by 0.9 points to 100.8. The report said that uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the U.S. election and the recent surge in oil prices have left companies cautious, leaving actual orders below those implied by the high optimism levels. The increase implied annual growth in output of 2.9 percent in the first quarter of 2005. \n",
      " Analysts said the figures support predictions that a slowdown in the economy in the third quarter of this year will give way to faster growth next spring. \n",
      " Peter Hemington, partner at BDO Stoy Hayward, said that was good news for Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, which is expected to call a general election next year. \n",
      " \"But U.K. Plc should not start celebrating yet _ interest rates could well increase to 5 percent in the new year,\" he said. \n",
      " The report said that a recent cooling in the housing market had masked the need for a potential future rate rise and future growth combined with inflationary pressures and potentially strong Christmas sales could tip the Bank of England towards another hike. \n",
      " The central bank has raised its key interest rate five times since last November from a low of 3.5 percent to the current 4.75 percent amid fears that inflation was accelerating, partly due to the housing boom. But for the last two months, the bank has frozen the rate as the market has shown signs of cooling. \n",
      " Douglas McWilliams, chief executive of the Center for Economics and Business Research, said the poll supported the idea that a slump in output over the past few months was temporary. \n",
      " \"However, if interest rates do rise above 5 percent, which they might ahead of the election next year, the U.K.'s debt burden will increase and growth could falter as a result,\" he added. \n",
      " The indices are calculated by taking a weighted average of the results of the Britain's main business surveys, covering more than 11,000 respondents from firms with some five million employees in various industries.: [8655, 8582, 8366]\n",

      "Pat Hurst made six straight birdies Friday in the du Maurier Classic and quietly served noticed that Se Ri Pak isn't the only woman capable of winning two major championships this year.  \n",
      " Hurst, who won her first major in the Dinah Shore in March, shot a 7-under-par 65 and shared the lead with Brandie Burton after two rounds of the lowest scoring in LPGA major championship history.  \n",
      " Burton, whose birdie-eagle finish gave her a 64, and Hurst were at 132. They were one stroke ahead of Betsy King going into the weekend, with Annika Sorenstam and Meg Mallon another stroke back at 134.  \n",
      " While big galleries and big expectations followed Pak in her bid to win a third straight major, Hurst made one putt after another with only about 100 people looking on.  \n",
      " That didn't seem to bother the 28-year-old Hurst, whose victory in the Dinah Shore has been all but forgetten in the euphoria over Pak.  \n",
      " \"You can't take that away from me, and you can't take away from what Se Ri has done,\" Hurst said. \"What she's done the last five weeks has been unbelievable.  \n",
      " \"I'm just quietly going along, and that's the way I like it.\"  \n",
      " Pak, trying to become the first woman since Pat Bradley in 1986 to win three majors in a season and the first golfer since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three in a row, played another lackluster round _ a 2-under 70 that left her seven strokes off the lead.  \n",
      " \"My game not good, but not bad,\" Pak said. \"Maybe tomorrow or Sunday I can find solid shot. I have two days left. I have chance.\"  \n",
      " Her 5-under 139 through two rounds wasn't nearly enough to keep pace with the leaders, who had few problems at the Essex Golf and Country Club on a sunny, sometimes breezy day.  \n",
      " \"I think there are a lot of people who can still win the golf tournament,\" said King, who lacks only the du Maurier for the LPGA's career grand slam. \"It might take 20-under the way things look now.\"  \n",
      " Tammie Green was among those at 9-under 135. Laura Davies worked herself back into contention with a 67 that left her at 136, along with Dottie Pepper and Helen Alfredsson.  \n",
      " \"I don't think you can sharpen this course's teeth too much,\" Davies said. \"Ten-under at a major is usually leading by 10 strokes.\"  \n",
      " The cut was 2-under 142, the lowest ever for an LPGA major. The previous record was 1-over 145 in the 1987 LPGA Championship. The lowest cut for any LPGA Tour event was 3-under 141 in the State Farm Rail Classic last year at Springfield, Ill.  \n",
      " Among those who missed the cut were Bradley, Kelly Robbins and defending champion Colleen Walker.  \n",
      " \"The course is playing a little shorter than a major like the U.S. Open,\" Hurst said. \"The greens are true, but when you have a lot of wedges and 9-irons into greens, you will have birdie opportunities.\"  \n",

      " Leghari said police had also detained Ali's father and two brothers for questioning, as well as a cleric who preaches at Ali's mosque. Ali and his family were originally from the central Pakistani city of Multan, but had lived in Karachi for some years, Leghari said. \n",

      "Ivory Coast's president has begun a U.N.-backed extended year in power Monday amid strong objections from rebels and opposition leaders who have called for him to step down. \n",
      " Gbagbo's opponents, including several Cabinet ministers, say they will no longer recognize his authority. Amid the controversy, many Ivorians have feared new violence, particularly Sunday _ the original date for a postponed presidential vote. \n",
      " \"You see that today is the 31st of October, and the sky hasn't fallen on our heads,\" Gbagbo told a small room of supporters at an Abidjan hotel. \"Today is a new day and tomorrow will be a new day, and it will be like that until elections take place.\" \n",
      " On Sunday, Gbagbo said he would name a new prime minister within days to ensure a presidential ballot would be held within 12 months. \n",
      " Afterward, rebels issued a statement proclaiming their leader Guillaume Soro as the new premier, although they have no legal authority to do so. The move was sure to increase tension in the war-divided country and added to confusion over who will replace the incumbent premier, Seydou Diarra. \n",
      " \"There is no great nation that hasn't gone through difficult tests,\" Gbagbo said. \"We will face this crisis and get out of it using the path of the law and the constitution. If each person has to take has to pick up a gun to change the law, well, our nation will be no more.\" \n",
      " Gbagbo has ruled the world's top cocoa producer since winning elections in 2000. Two years later, he lost control of the northern half of the country to rebels who took up arms against him after a failed coup. \n",
      " A long-awaited presidential vote was initially set to have been held Sunday, but Gbagbo canceled the vote last month, blaming rebels for failing to disarm. Government militia have also failed to lay down arms under a U.N.-backed nationwide disarmament plan. \n",
      " Gbagbo says the constitution gives him the right to postpone the vote and stay in power because of the conflict. Rebels and opposition leaders in Abidjan dispute his interpretation of the document and say he has no legal right to stay in power. \n",
      " The U.N. Security Council and the 53-nation African Union have issued resolutions backing an extension of Gbagbo's mandate for a year. They have also called for the appointment of a new prime minister to make sure the postponed ballot is held. \n",
      " \"I refuse to change the fundamental laws of this country by Kalashnikov,\" Gbagbo said Monday. \"We are ready to discuss with everybody, but we aren't ready to trample on our state so the rebellion prospers.\" \n",
      " On Sunday, rebels issued a statement declaring Gbagbo's mandate \"well and truly over,\" and saying they would no longer recognize him as head of state. The statement referred to Soro as prime minister and said he would set up a \"future government of national reconciliation\" but did not say how. \n",
      " On Sunday, security forces fired tear gas and bullets to disperse thousands of opposition youths who set up roadblocks and burned tires on a six-lane road in Abidjan. \n",
      " Pro-Gbagbo youth militants who helped sweep Gbagbo to power during 2000 street protests are planning a rally of their own Tuesday. \n",
      " Once a bastion of peace in a region beset by war, Ivory Coast has been in decline since the country's first coup d'etat in 1999. \n",
      " Since taking office, Gbagbo has faced years of turbulence including failed uprisings, street violence, rising crime and the loss of the northern half of the country to rebels in 2002. \n",
      " About 6,000 U.N. peacekeepers and 4,000 French troops are deployed here, most along a buffer zone that divides the two sides. \n",

      "Fire continued to burn inside the Achille Lauro early Thursday, a day after the flames forced the nearly 1,000 people aboard take to lifeboats and abandon the cruise ship off Somalia.  \n",
      " Two people were reported dead and one missing in the flight from the Achille Lauro, which gained notoriety in 1985 when Palestinian terrorists hijacked and killed a wheelchair-bound American passenger.  \n",
      " Overflights by U.S. Navy helicopters at dawn Thursday found the ship listing but in no danger of sinking some 25 kilometers (15 miles) offshore in the Indian Ocean, said Cmdr. T. McCreary, spokesman US Naval Forces Central Command in the Gulf.  \n",
      " After fighting the blaze, the last 60 crewmembers abandoned the badly listing vessel Wednesday and boarded merchant ships helping in the rescue. The 23,478-ton vessel was 210 kilometers (130 miles) south of the Horn of Africa when the crewmembers left.  \n",
      " \"I just passed the Achille Lauro overhead and she is fully engulfed, almost now in flames. Flames have progressed far forward in the ship,\" said U.S. Navy pilot Lt. Paul Frost, who flew over the site Wednesday afternoon.  \n",
      " Eight people were injured in the fire.  \n",
      " The ship's owner, Genoa-based Starlauro, said the blaze apparently broke out in the passenger area, but the cause was unknown.  \n",
      " Capt. Ferdinando Lolli, a port official in Rome, said the ship was carrying 581 passengers and 404 crew. Most of the crew was Italian, and the passengers mainly South African, German, Dutch and British.  \n",
      " Late Wednesday evening, Italian Coast Guard officials reported that one person from the Achille Lauro was still unaccounted for. The two reported dead were identified by Italian news agencies as a Briton and a German.  \n",
      " The Panamanian oil ship Hawaiian King was one of the first ships to arrive at the scene and took on about 800 people, said a coast guard official in Rome, Adm. Eugenio Sicurezza. The Liberian-registered Bar Du, and a Greek ship, the Treasure Island, also were picking up passengers.  \n",
      " Two U.S. warships, the USS Gettysburg and USS Halyburton, reached the scene overnight and dispatched helicopters to ferry water, food and medical supplies to the survivors, said McCreary.  \n",
      " The commerical and Navy ships will divide up the passengers Thursday and send them on, mostly to Mombasa, Kenya, and Djibouti, McCreary said. Others reportedly will be taken to the Seychelles. All three destinations are about 1,930 kilometers (1,200 miles) away from the Achille Lauro.  \n",
      " The Achille Lauro left Genoa on Nov. 19, stopped in Israel, and its next port of call was to be Durban, South Africa, on Friday, said Carla Gotta, a spokeswoman for the cruise ship's owner.  \n",
      " The terrorists who hijacked the Achille Lauro in 1985 shot American Leon Klinghoffer and pushed him in his wheelchair off the ship. The hijackers escaped the vessel and boarded a jet, but U.S. fighter planes forced it to land in Italy and the hijackers were captured.  \n",
      " The Achille Lauro resumed service as a cruise ship shortly after the hijacking. Klinghoffer's convicted killer is serving a 30-year term in an Italian prison. Two other men are serving lesser terms and a fourth person, 17 at the time of the hijacking and tried as a juvenile, was paroled in 1991.  \n",
      " George Bennett, spokesman for the U.N. operation in Somalia, said the Achille Lauro's position was close to the small Somali fishing village of Eil, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) off the coast.  \n",
      " Launched in 1946 in the Netherlands, the Achille Lauro was acquired 20 years later by the Neapolitan shipping dynasty. Its sides painted a royal blue, the Achille Lauro first transported Italian immigrant workers to and from Australia. In 1970 it was outfitted for pleasure cruises.  \n",
      " But it has had its share of problems: The liner rammed a fishing boat in 1971 off Italy, killing a Neapolitan fisherman.  \n",

      " \"I am afraid the dust will gather again,\" said hotel owner Salah Mahmoud. He said his hotel sat mostly empty until the influx of pilgrims helped him restart his business in Karbala, also 90 miles from the capital.  \n",
      " Thousands of Iranian pilgrims regularly visited the holy Shiite cities of Najaf and Karbala before war broke out between the two countries in 1980.  \n",
      " The border was not officially reopened until July 1998, when an agreement was made to allow 12,000 Iranian pilgrims to visit monthly. Iran closed the border again that December, citing fears for the pilgrims' safety during U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq.  \n",
      " The border was reopened last November, and hundreds of thousands of pilgrims have made the emotional journey to the revered sites.  \n",
      " On July 28, the pilgrimages stopped.  \n",

      "Israel's parliament easily approved handing responsibility over the Gaza-Egypt border to Egyptian soldiers, but the debate became part of a rift that could hold up further Mideast peacemaking _ hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu's campaign to unseat Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. \n",
      " The 53-28 vote on Wednesday, in favor of posting 750 Egyptian troops to replace Israeli forces that have been toiling to stop Palestinian arms smuggling, approved a key element in ending Israel's 38-year occupation of the Gaza Strip. \n",
      " While the evacuation of all 21 settlements in Gaza and four in the West Bank has widespread public support, Netanyahu is basing his challenge on opposition among registered members of the ruling Likud Party to the pullout. Many ideologues in the traditionally pro-settlement party are opposed. They control party institutions, giving Netanyahu a solid chance to unseat Sharon. \n",
      " With a Likud party convention set for late September, election fever is rising in Israel. Elections are set for late 2006 but are likely to be brought forward, as both Likud and the moderate Labor are in the throes of leadership contests. \n",
      " Palestinians are also facing parliamentary elections, and the focus by both sides on domestic politics is likely to push the hoped-for push for a peace accord in the wake of Israel's Gaza pullout off the table. \n",
      " Netanyahu quit Sharon's government three weeks ago before the last vote on the pullout, saying he could not take part in the responsibility for evacuating Gaza and part of the West Bank. Since then, he has been repeating themes from his 1996-99 term as prime minister, demanding concrete returns for Israeli gestures and charging that Sharon is undermining Israeli security. \n",
      " During the parliamentary debate on the agreement with Egypt, Netanyahu displayed his basic distrust of both the Palestinians and the Egyptians, insisting on Israeli control of the Egypt-Gaza border, as well as the Gaza seacoast and air space. \n",
      " \"It is important that we keep the Philadelphi road in our hands,\" he said, referring to the border route, \"and certainly not give a port or airport to the Islamic terror base which is going to arise in Gaza.\" \n",

      " \"I want to tell all the members of the house who don't understand _ reality has changed,\" Mofaz said. Without the border pullout, Israel could not claim to have ended its occupation. \"Israel cannot remain in the Philadelphi corridor when there is a better alternative that does not endanger Israel's security,\" he said. \n",
      " The parliamentary action was little more than a technicality, changing the 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty to allow for posting 750 lightly armed Egyptian border police along the 13-kilometer (8-mile) stretch of desert from the Mediterranean Sea alongside Gaza to the Israeli border. \n",
      " Netanyahu opened his anti-Sharon campaign with a visit Wednesday to Israel's largest West Bank settlement, Maaleh Adumim, 5 kilometers (3 miles) east of Jerusalem. He criticized Sharon for holding up a plan to build housing for Israelis between the two. The plan has come under stiff U.S. criticism. \n",
      " Netanyahu charged that Sharon is leading to division of Jerusalem. Palestinians claim east Jerusalem as the capital of a state they want to create in the West Bank and Gaza. They charge that the construction plan is a way of cutting the West Bank off from east Jerusalem. \n",

      " ORANJESTAD, Aruba (AP) -- Aruban prosecutors said Thursday that authorities are investigating new information in the Natalee Holloway case provided by a Dutch crime reporter. \n",
      " Information from reporter Peter R. de Vries \"may help considerably\" in resolving what happened to the American, who vanished during a May 2005 school vacation to the Dutch Caribbean island, the prosecutor's office said in a statement. \n",
      " The statement did not specify the new material, but said it \"may shed a new light on the mode\" in which Holloway died and the \"method by which her body disappeared.\" \n",
      " An attorney for Joran van der Sloot, a Dutch man who was a suspect in the case, said it was irresponsible for prosecutors to make the announcement without describing their evidence. \n",

      " Army Chief of Staff Gary Best said the men died during a gunfight with police and soldiers late Wednesday at Buxton Village, about a half mile from Lusignan, where six adults and five children were killed on Saturday. \n",
      " Authorities have cornered about a dozen gang members in Buxton's thick jungles and plan to burn portions of it to uncover hiding places. The gang usually retreats there after committing armed robberies and clashing with rival gangs, Guyana Police Chief Henry Greene said. \n",
      " Police said the five men arrested are members of a gang led by Rondell Rawlins, who on Wednesday called a local newspaper and pledged more violence if his pregnant, 18-year-old girlfriend does not appear. \n",
      " Rawlins, who had accused police of abducting Tenisha Morgan, said he organized the killings, according to the paper's top editors. Authorities say they do not have her, but Greene said police are pursuing three people suspected of kidnapping her. \n",
      " Residents in Lusignan and neighboring towns have organized several protests over what they say is police failure to prevent violence. Authorities have made arrests and used tear gas on the crowds. \n",

      " Teachers Federation President Rafael Feliciano told a local radio station Thursday that teachers still might strike for higher wages and better working conditions, and he urged Puerto Rican Education Secretary Rafael Aragunde to resume negotiations. \n",
      " With contract talks at an impasse, the union that represents the U.S. Caribbean territory's 42,000 teachers, had warned that a strike could start as early as Friday. \n",
      " Feliciano told radio station WSKN that teachers have decided to stay on the job at least through next week. After that, a strike \"will begin when the executive committee decides,\" he said. \n",
      " Puerto Rican law forbids disruption of the public education system, so strikers are potentially vulnerable to being fired. The island's government labor relations board decertified the Teachers' Federation last month after some of its members authorized a walkout. Many rank-and-file unions members are divided over the threatened strike. \n",

      " The Ravens dealt the Titans their only loss in 17 home games at Adelphia Coliseum _ 24-23 on Nov. 12.  \n",
      " But Fisher pointed out that the Titans lost only because Al Del Greco missed a 43-yard field goal as time expired.  \n",

      " In all, 193 of 535 members of the House and Senate joined Bush for the lunch, an event he hopes to turn into a tradition. About 50 Democrats showed up, but without their two top leaders, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri.  \n",
      " Gephardt had complained over the weekend that Bush has operated with a \"my way or the highway\" attitude on legislative matters. \"We don't talk, we don't negotiate, we don't really collaborate and work together on these policies,\" he said Sunday.  \n",

      " Bush has made bipartisanship a theme of his first months in office, although his first major initiative _ a $1.6 trillion tax cut _ has met strong partisan resistance in the evenly divided Senate and the barely Republican House.  \n",
      " Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said he didn't think Democrats were making a statement by staying away. He said he attended because, \"in Louisiana, we just don't like to turn down lunch invitations.\"  \n",
      " Besides Abercrombie, Breaux, Graham and Inouye, Democrats in attendance included Sens. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii, and House members Ken Bentsen of Texas and Sanford Bishop of Georgia.  \n",

      " A Battleground Poll released Monday suggested that just over half of Americans think Bush has improved the tone of politics in Washington and almost two-thirds think he has made significant efforts to reach out to Democrats. Four in 10 say they would have more confidence in Bush than in the Democratic Congress when it comes to protecting the middle class.  \n",

      "The mothers of three men missing since a police raid gave blood samples so their DNA could be checked against DNA from three bodies found on a volcano slope overlooking Mexico City.  \n",
      " The Mexico City attorney general's office said Tuesday it could take weeks to identify the bodies, among 14 found in dumps and along roadsides around Mexico's capital over the past three weeks.  \n",
      " The latest victim was a man about 40 years old who was shot to death and then thrown out of a car on the Periferico expressway on Tuesday, police said. The victim was not immediately identified.  \n",
      " The discovery of the three bodies on the slope could support continuing, macabre speculation about the whereabouts of three young men, who vanished during a Sept. 8 police raid on the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Mexico City.  \n",
      " Three others who vanished in the Buenos Aires raid turned up dead the next day, showing signs of torture. They had last been seen in the company of police, according to their families. Investigators have been probing the possible involvement of police in their deaths.  \n",
      " The three bodies undergoing DNA testing were found Monday on the Picacho-Ajusco highway in southern Mexico City. All three bodies were badly decomposed, and the head of one had been badly burned and its feet were missing.  \n",
      " Human rights groups charge that police have often swept up innocent bystanders with petty criminals during the raids, which are conducted in an attempt to crack down on crime.  \n",
      " Critics claim that major criminals usually have been warned ahead of raids by friends on the force.  \n",
      " Officially, an average of 560 crimes with firearms are committed daily in Mexico City, including five or six homicides. Many robberies and kidnappings are not counted, however, because victims do not report them to police.  \n",
      " Police are frequently accused of involvement with criminal gangs in kidnapping, drug trafficking and robberies.  \n",

      "China has ordered local health inspectors to step up measures to prevent food poisoning in the wake of an outbreak of the E. coli O157 bacteria that has killed seven and sickened more than 8,700 people in Japan.  \n",

      " The Health and Quarantine Bureau will enforce stricter inspections of flights from Japan arriving in Beijing, it said.  \n",
      " Passengers arriving from overseas are routinely given quarantine questionnaires to fill out and hand over to officials on arrival, but the requirement usually seems to be just a formality and passengers are rarely stopped or questioned.  \n",
      " So far, no recent cases of O157 infection have been reported in China, the report quoted Kan Xuegui, director of the ministry's department of health inspection, as saying.  \n",
      " The O157 bacteria was first reported in China nine years ago. Since then, scattered cases have been found in Beijing, in northwestern Xinjiang, southern Jiangsu and eastern Shandong provinces.  \n",
      " The report said experts believed the Chinese traditional custom of only consuming boiled water and cooked meats and vegetables has helped prevent outbreaks of the bacteria.  \n",
      " But Kan warned that more should be done to prevent food poisoning, particularly during the hot, humid summer.  \n",
      " The government is particularly concerned about preventing disease in the vast areas of southern and eastern China that have been severely flooded this summer, he said.  \n",
      " The current outbreak in Japan has been blamed on contaminated school lunches, but officials there have not been able to determine the specific food that contained the bacteria.  \n",

      "In the first comprehensive global study of sexual behavior, British researchers found that people aren't losing their virginity at ever younger ages, married people have the most sex, and there is no firm link between promiscuity and sexually transmitted diseases. \n",
      " The study was published Wednesday as part of a series on sexual and reproductive health by the British medical journal, The Lancet. Professor Kaye Wellings of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicines and her colleagues analyzed data from 59 countries worldwide. \n",
      " Experts say data gleaned from the study will be useful not only in dispelling popular myths about sexual behavior, but in shaping policies that will help improve sexual health across the world. \n",
      " Wellings said she was surprised by some of the survey's results. \n",
      " \"We did have some of our preconceptions dashed,\" she said, explaining that they had expected to find the most promiscuous behavior in regions like Africa with the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases. That was not the case, as multiple partners were more commonly reported in industrialized countries where the incidence of such diseases were relatively low. \n",
      " \"There's a misperception that there's a great deal of promiscuity in Africa, which is one of the potential reasons for HIV/AIDS spreading so rapidly,\" said Dr. Paul van Look, director of Reproductive Health and Research at the World Health Organization, who was unconnected to the study. \"But that view is not supported by the evidence.\" \n",
      " Wellings says that implies that promiscuity may be less important than factors such as poverty and education -- especially in the encouragement of condom use -- in the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. \n",
      " The study also found that contrary to popular belief, sexual activity is not starting any earlier than previously believed. Nearly everywhere, men and women have their first sexual experiences in their late teens (aged 15-19 years), with younger ages for women than for men. \n",
      " Researchers also found that married people have the most sex, and that there has been a gradual shift to delay marriage, even in developing countries. \n",
      " While that has meant a predictable rise in the rates of premarital sex, experts say this doesn't necessarily translate into more dangerous behavior. \n",
      " In some instances, married women may be at more risk than single women. \n",
      " \"A single woman is more able to negotiate safe sex in certain circumstances than a married woman,\" says van Look, who points out that married women in Africa and Asia are often threatened by unfaithful husbands who frequent prostitutes. \n",
      " There is much greater equality between women and men with regard to the number of sexual partners in rich countries than in poor countries, the study found. For example, men and women in Australia, Britain, France and the US tend to have an almost equal number of sexual partners. In contrast, in Cameroon, Haiti, and Kenya, men tend to have multiple partners while women tend only to have one. This imbalance has significant public health implications. \"In countries where women are beholden to their male partners, they are likely not to have the power to request condom use, and they probably won't know about their husbands' transgressions,\" said Wellings. \n",
      " Because of the diversity of sexual habits worldwide, Wellings warns that no single approach to sexual health will work everywhere. \"There are very different economic, religious and social rules governing sexual conduct across the world,\" Wellings said.: [23905, 22916, 18340]\n",

      "Last fall, insurgents overran police stations and Iraqi army bases in this northern rural region, scaring off nearly all 2,000 Iraqi troops and keeping people locked inside their homes at night. \n",
      " Last month only two attacks took place in the region mostly populated by Sunni Arabs and Kurds, according to U.S. commanders in the area. \n",
      " The difference, they say, stems from a new approach of relying on sheiks and mukhtars _ the tribal and local leaders who wield enormous influence among some 75,000 people in hundreds of villages and small towns south of the city of Mosul. \n",
      " \"Sheiks are the real power here,\" said Lt. Col. Bradley Becker, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Field Artillery Regiment. \"Mayors just aren't as good as sheiks on security matters.\" \n",
      " Becker says he now meets with 50 to 100 sheiks a week, and holds monthly gatherings with them in a base auditorium that usually shows movies for relaxing soldiers. Sheiks and mukhtars, most in white robes, some walking gingerly with canes, flow into the room and listen to U.S. and Iraqi officials talking about security as well as local issues such as electricity supply. \n",
      " About six people showed up for the first meeting early this year _ but the latest, on Tuesday, drew about 300. Much of it took a townhall tone, hearing complaints about gasoline shortages and inquiries about arrested fellow tribesmen. \n",
      " \"After November, what happened was bad, but they came to us,\" Sheik Nief Saleh said of the Americans. \"I try to help as I can.\" \n",
      " In return for the sheiks' help, Becker says he has spent close to US$1 million (euro830,000) on reconstruction jobs employing hundreds of tribesmen. \n",
      " Critics say this approach undermines the institutions of pluralist national government which the United States is trying to build because it empowers conservative leaders who preach restrictions on women's rights and a strict interpretation of Islamic law. \n",
      " Others, however, say it empowers ancient ruling institutions at the exact moment when the new government needs all the support it can get. \n",
      " \"Am I here to make social change so women can smoke cigarettes and drive cars? No,\" said Becker. \"We're here to provide security and build infrastructure and a democratic society.\" \n",
      " Phebe Marr, author of \"The Modern History of Iraq,\" says that as long as Iraq is short of security forces, \"tribal leaders may be the only resources available.\" \n",
      " However, she said in an e-mail, \"Relying on and supporting tribal structures does delegitimize local government and solidifies traditional tribal practices.\" \n",
      " But for military officials here, it's a practical way of dealing with the most pressing matter _ violence that has shaken public confidence in the elected government. \n",
      " Pragmatism also shaped the makeup of the region's three Iraqi battalions. Here Sunni Arabs and Kurds are largely segregated _ a departure from the approach tried elsewhere of stitching the groups together in single units. \n",
      " For now, over 300 U.S. soldiers and about 3,000 Iraqi soldiers control the area, establishing dozens of checkpoints on the highways to central cities. These have hobbled the insurgency locally, allowing the region to focus on development even though occasional attacks still happen, U.S. officials say. \n",
      " As the 2nd Battalion arrived last November, a burst of insurgent violence during the Muslim holiday of Ramadan destroyed six police stations and several Iraqi Army bases. All but about 50 Iraqi soldiers abandoned their posts, Becker said. \n",
      " Now mukhtars bring in some of the area's most wanted men with just a phone call from U.S. commanders, Becker said, relieving his soldiers from having to raid suspected homes. U.S. officials say the mukhtars value the reconstruction aid and do not want to return to the days when they were caught between U.S. and insurgent battles. \n",
      " Becker acknowledges that the strategy of involving local leaders won't work everywhere, but he says it can be effective in some places and wishes other units would try it. \n",
      " Becker, a native of Sacramento, California, is deeply immersed in the region's everyday life. He has attended the funeral of every Iraqi soldier killed in his sector, and he knows the names of villages that even his locally recruited translators haven't heard of. \n",

      " Law enforcement officials, who are allowed to use motorized vehicles in these areas only in cases of fire and other emergencies, would be exempt from some of the guidelines due to the nature of their work, Meicht said.  \n",

But \"that doesn't change the fact that we still have the authority to issue temporary permits ... That's allowed under the state land master plan,\" Meicht said.  \n",
      " One area where motor vehicles have allegedly been misused is the Santononi Preserve in the Adirondacks. The groups also say the DEC improperly bulldozed a wide trail for snowmobilers through the Vanderwhacker Mountain Wild Forest tract, also in the Adirondacks.  \n",

      "Michael Jackson's stunning death made him the Internet's biggest star this year. \n",
      " The quest to find out what happened to Jackson in his final hours on June 25 and celebrate his legacy elevated the late entertainer to the top of the Internet's search charts for 2009. On Yahoo, it ended singer Britney Spears' four-year reign on top. \n",
      " The annual lists released Tuesday were compiled separately by Google Inc. and Yahoo Inc., which combined handle two-thirds of the world's Internet searches. \n",
      " Jackson also grabbed the top spot on the third-largest U.S. search engine, Microsoft Corp.'s Bing, which announced its rankings Sunday. AOL, which relies on Google's search technology, also had Jackson at No. 1. \n",
      " The lists are meant to provide a reading on our cultural pulse. \n",
      " As usual, people using Yahoo's search engine in 2009 seemed to be most interested in celebrities and other diversions, even against the sobering backdrop of the worst recession in 70 years. \n",
      " Google's audience seem more interested in using the Internet to connect with friends and family. \n",
      " The online hangout Facebook and Tuenti, a similar socializing site in Spain, both made Google's Top 10, as did the popular communications tool Twitter. Microsoft's latest Windows operating system also grabbed a spot. Singer Lady Gaga was the only other celebrity besides Jackson on Google's Top 10. \n",
      " Google, which processes more than six times the search volume that Yahoo does, has had a more diverse mix in its annual search rankings. The self-proclaimed King of Pop follows former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin (2008) and Apple Inc.'s iPhone (2007) in Google's top spot. \n",
      " Besides Jackson, the other new entrants on Yahoo's Top 10 list this year were: No. 2, \"Twilight,\" the vampire story that has spawned two movies, including the recently released \"New Moon,\" that are drawing hordes of teenage girls and their mothers; No. 4, Megan Fox, an actress who starred in the movie \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen;\" No. 8, Kim Kardashian, part of a family with their own reality TV series; and No. 9, NASCAR, an automobile racing league. \n",
      " \"New Moon\" also made Google's Top 10. \n",
      " The other half of Yahoo's list consisted of 2008 holdovers. With the defending champion Spears dropping to fifth, the others were: No. 3, WWE, or World Wrestling Entertainment; No. 6, Naruto, a character created for the Japanese art form known as anime; No. 7, top-rated television series \"American Idol;\" and No. 10, RuneScape, an online video game. \n",
      " Barack Obama made Yahoo's top searches list in 2008 as a presidential candidate and the President-elect, but fell off after he took office in 2009. The others falling out of the Top 10 were all actresses: Miley Cyrus, Jessica Alba, Lindsay Lohan and Angelina Jolie. \n",
      " Google also said Obama was among search requests that declined the most in 2009. Others losing steam included singer Amy Winehouse and actor Heath Ledger, whose January 2008 death triggered a searching frenzy. \n",
      " Although the economy couldn't compete with entertainment in 2009, the hard times clearly weighed on people's minds. \"Coupons\" and \"unemployment\" were the most requested searches tied to finances, according to Yahoo. \n",
      " Ask.com, another major search engine, focused its list on the most popular questions posed on its search engine. \"How do I get out of debt?\" was the second-ranking question of the year. \n",
      " No. 1? \"How much should I weigh?\" \n",

      "They gather a few blocks from Harvard Square to greet the Sabbath with communal prayer, their eyes winced closed, hands clapping as they sing in fervent Hebrew. The group worships in the Jewish Orthodox tradition, but it is not traditional Orthodoxy. \n",
      " A woman leads the prayers, generally forbidden among mainstream Orthodox. The genders are separated by a white curtain, called a \"mechitzah,\" but it is translucent so the sexes can see each other as they sway and sing. No rabbi leads or synagogue sanctions this service at the Minyan Tehillah, which is run by a software engineer and nurse practitioner. \n",
      " The group is an \"independent minyan,\" and dozens of these unaffiliated Jewish worship communities have sprung up in the past decade, mixing elements of the mainstream denominations while answering to none of them. Its prayers in Hebrew, with participation of everyone present, is a hallmark of the movement, and a reaction to mainstream alternatives where such prayer is not available, or limited to a designated soloist. \n",
      " Anna Schachter of Cambridge said the minyan's dual commitment to traditional worship and egalitarianism was energizing. \n",
      " \"Everyone in this room, I feel I'm sort of bonded to them with this mission, this struggle, of `How do you live a traditional life and a modern life at the same time?'\" said Schachter, 29, a public health researcher. \"If there was a synagogue that had this kind of style, I would go to it.\" \n",
      " Ten years ago, the United States had two independent minyanim, plural of minyan. Today, at least 70 exist, involving about 20,000 people, said Rabbi Elie Kaunfer, who wrote a book on the independent minyanim, \"Empowered Judaism.\" \n",
      " \"There is a mass of young people, taking hold of their Jewish identity, and willing to put in the volunteer time and effort to build a community that expresses their values,\" Kaunfer said. \"That's extremely hopeful and significant.\" \n",
      " The number involved is a small percentage of the estimated 5.2 million Jews in the United States, but Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, said the movement is driven by the most devout and educated Jews. He said its ideas on worship, prayer and what defines a community inevitably will cross into mainstream practice. \n",
      " \"What happens in American Judaism over and over is that the margins influence the mainstream,\" Sarna said. \"I don't expect many of the independent minyanim themselves will be long lasting. But I think we will look back and say that they had long-lasting influence.\" \n",
      " In Jewish law, a minyan is a quorum of at least 10 people (10 men in the Orthodox tradition) that is required to read the Torah or say certain prayers. A minyan usually is defined as any community that comes together to pray. \n",
      " The independent minyanim have formed primarily in urban areas, including New York City, as far south as Atlanta, Georgia, and west to San Francisco and Los Angeles, both in California. Sarna said with the middle of the country largely untapped, the movement will grow. \n",
      " Meg Lederman, a member of a minyan in Brookline, Massachusetts, said a major draw of the worship is as a link to her Jewish past. \n",
      " \"It's nice to be in a room where you're filling up the whole room with meaningful words,\" she said. \"It's both the connection to the people in the room and really a connection to Jews across time and space.\" \n",
      " The growth of independent minyanim is similar to the grass roots \"havurah\" movement in the 1960s and 1970s, which organized outside the synagogue with heavy emphasis on lively prayer and including women. But Kaunfer said a major difference is that the havurah movement wanted to replace Jewish institutions, while independent minyanim aim merely at gaps that have appeared in Jewish life. \n",
      " Many members are in their 20s and 30s, either single or with very young children, and part of a demographic that has developed as people postpone marriage and children, Kaunfer said. Jews in this group tend to be urban, mobile and unsatisfied by typical synagogue offerings, which are aimed generally at older adults or parents with school-aged children, he said. \n",
      " Group members often are highly educated in Jewish tradition; 40 percent are graduates of Jewish day schools. They seek the deep spiritual connection found in traditional prayer that the Orthodox practice, Kaunfer said, but they also want women to be more involved in worship, as in the Conservative and Reform denominations. So they have decided to lead their own services. \n",
      " Some independent minyanim meet in synagogues, and members are active in them. But the decentralized movement has grown largely without the denominations, whose leaders say they welcome such committed groups of young people, an elusive demographic. \n",
      " \"These are exactly the kind of people we want and need in the community because they're going to be the leaders of the future,\" said Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union for Reform Judaism. \"The fact that they don't always find a place in the synagogue is something that obviously is troubling to me.\" \n",
      " Orthodox Rabbi Shmuel Goldin, first vice president of the Rabbinical Council of America, said he was \"thrilled with the energy and the interest.\" He said, however, that the groups' search for relevance in ancient tradition has led to violations of it, such as with women's role in prayer. Rabbis, he said, have always been crucial in maintaining tradition. \n",
      " \"We are troubled with the change in tradition,\" Goldin said. \"We believe there are ways to find relevance and meaning without these radical changes.\" \n",
      " Their self-governing nature means independent minyanim differ in style and emphasis. For instance, Lisa Colton, co-founder of a minyan in Charlottesville, Virginia, said her minyan's service, held in a friend's living room, stresses interaction between parents and young children that she was not finding at the local synagogue she attends. \n",
      " Colton, 35, said the group is not interested in changing tradition, just in sharing a kind of worship they realized they could create themselves. \n"

      "Aborigines are 13 times more likely to be jailed than other Australians and have a lower life expectancy, poorer health and smaller incomes than their fellow citizens, a report released Friday said. \n",
      " The government-commissioned report into disadvantages faced by indigenous people found that the number of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders behind bars jumped by 32 percent between 2000 and 2006. \n",
      " They now make up about 23.6 percent of the prison population, up from 20 percent in 2002. \n",
      " \"Poverty, unemployment, low levels of educational attainment and lack of access to social services are associated with high crime rates and high levels of imprisonment,\" it said. \n",
      " The Productivity Commission report found that indigenous people have a life expectancy 17 years lower than other Australians -- with an Aboriginal male born in 2007 expected to live to the age of 59, far below the 77 of other men. \n",
      " Aborigines also lag significantly in earnings with median gross weekly individual incomes sitting at about 340 dollars (280 US) compared with more than 618 dollars for the rest of the community. \n",
      " And Aborigines and Torres Strait Islands are twice as likely to have a serious disability, according to the report, \"Overcoming Indigenous Disadvantage: Key Indicators.\" \n",
      " \"Around 36 percent of the indigenous population aged 15 years or over reported a disability or long-term health condition in 2002,\" it said. \n",
      " Indigenous people are more likely to suffer health conditions such as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and kidney disease than non-Aboriginals, it said. \n",
      " Chair of the Productivity Commission, Gary Banks, said the report had unearthed some positive findings such as greater employment and higher incomes for indigenous people. \n",
      " \"There have also been welcome improvements in some education and health outcomes for indigenous children,\" he said. \n",
      " But he said that many indicators showed little improvement and even in those areas where there had been gains, indigenous people continued to do worse than other Australians. \n",
      " \"Indeed, in some key areas, outcomes for indigenous people have been deteriorating,\" he said. \n",
      " Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough said the report held some encouraging signs -- such as indigenous unemployment falling from 30 percent in 1994 to 13 percent by 2005. \n",
      " But he acknowledged there was more work for the government to do and urged indigenous communities to take more responsibility for their lives. \n",
      " \"Let's be honest with ourselves and say a lot of this comes down to personal responsibility and people being responsible for their drug and alcohol behaviour, the abuse they inflict on others,\" he said. \n",

      "Former Australia coach Eddie Jones has blasted English rugby's \"crazy\" set-up, saying the national side faces \"problems across the board\" after a trio of heavy losses to the Tri-Nations. \n",
      " England, under new manager Martin Johnson, were beaten on successive weekends at Twickenham last month. \n",
      " Australia started things off with a 28-14 victory before world champions South Africa won 42-6 to inflict England's heaviest home defeat. \n",
      " New Zealand then piled on the agony with a 32-6 success last weekend. \n",
      " In those three games England conceded 102 points and only scored 26, while letting in nine tries and managing just one in reply. \n",
      " Jones, now the director of rugby at English Premiership side Saracens, slammed the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for a lack of player development since an England side captained by Johnson beat the Australia team he coached in the 2003 World Cup final. \n",
      " \"The problems are across the board,\" Jones said. \"England haven't got a coherent understanding of how to attack and their defence is poor. \n",
      " \"They have conceded 100 points in three games - you won't do anything in Test rugby if you concede 100 points. \n",
      " \"I think Martin has to decide whether he wants to be the head coach. If he is the manager, then who is the head coach? Someone has to take responsibility for coaching the team.\" \n",
      " England half-backs Danny Care and Danny Cipriani came into the November series with just two starts between them and during the course of a month which also saw the Pacific Islanders at Twickenham, six players made Test debuts. \n",
      " \"It is crazy. You have to ask the question - what elite development is going on in England rugby? \n",
      " \"Look at the England side now compared to 2004 and there has basically been no development. You have experienced players and inexperienced players and nothing in between.\" \n",
      " Former England outside-half Rob Andrew was appointed as the RFU's director of elite rugby two years ago, with player development a key responsibility. \n",
      " And Jones was in no doubt about what action he should take to bring on youthful talent. \n",
      " \"If I was Rob Andrew the first thing I would be doing would be to invest in a second tier competition so that all your best young players have regular rugby. Young players can lift and run as fast as you want - but they have to play games.\" \n",
      " Meanwhile Jones said England, last year's finalists, needed to radically alter their selection policy if they were to be a force at the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand. \n",
      " \"Historically a World Cup has been won by a team with 650 caps which is about 40 caps per player. England have to pick a squad now that is going to win the World Cup in 2011.\" \n"

      "A suspect in the Russia spy saga cracked after his arrest, confessing he was a Russian agent and pledging greater loyalty to the Kremlin than to his own son, US prosecutors said Thursday. \n",
      " The suspect, who operated under the false identity of Juan Lazaro, also revealed that his Peruvian born journalist wife, Vicky Pelaez, made several trips to South America to give intelligence to their Russian spymasters. \n",
      " They are among 11 \"deep-cover\" suspects charged with trying to infiltrate US policymaking circles and report back to Moscow in a Cold War-style spy case that has threatened to upset efforts to \"reset\" ties between the superpowers. \n",
      " Attorney Preet Bharara outlined Lazaro's remarkable confession in a letter to Judge Ronald Ellis, imploring him not to make the same mistake as a local court in Cyprus, which freed a key conspirator on bail who later fled. \n",
      " Although he later denied bail to another pair of key suspects, the judge said Pelaez, who has American citizenship, could be released under house arrest if somebody stumps up 250,000 dollars in cash. \n",
      " \"Vicky's case is more complicated. She does not appear to be a trained agent. She has a real identity and she is a US citizen, and she has an incentive to stay in the country,\" the judge decided. \n",
      " In what was described as a \"lengthy post-arrest statement\" after waiving his Miranda rights, Lazaro confessed that he was not Uruguayan and that \"Juan Lazaro\" was not his real name, although he never revealed his proper identity. \n",
      " He astonishingly told investigators that \"although he loved his son, he would not violate his loyalty to the 'Service' even for his son,\" according to the letter. The \"Service\" is short for Russia's foreign intelligence service SVR, the successor to the Soviet-era KGB. \n",
      " Nine of the 11 suspects faced bail hearings on Thursday in three separate courts, but the five awaiting their fate in Boston and Virginia will have to return another day as proceedings were postponed to consider further evidence. \n",
      " In New York, Richard and Cynthia Murphy -- accused of posing since the mid-1990s as a suburban couple in New Jersey while secretly garnering high-level contacts -- had their bail denied, while judge Ellis said he would decide on Lazaro at a later date. \n",
      " \"For what concerns the Murphys, ultimately the court has concluded that it just does not know who they are,\" Ellis said. \n",
      " There was expected to be little chance any would be granted bail after Cypriot authorities were left red-faced when Christopher Metsos, the alleged Kremlin money-man, escaped after being allowed to walk free. \n",
      " The US State Department scolded the Cypriot authorities for deciding Metsos could be released after simply paying a bond of 26,500 euros (32,330 dollars) and relinquishing his passport. \n",
      " \"As we had feared, having been given, unnecessarily, the chance to flee, he did so,\" spokesman Philip Crowley said, adding it was too early to say if the United States would issue a formal protest to Cyprus over the case. \n",
      " The Cypriot authorities said they were still hopeful of catching the fugitive. \"We know his whereabouts roughly from the information we have collected,\" said Justice Minister Loucas Louca. \n",
      " It was feared Metsos might try to cross into the breakaway north of the Mediterranean island -- a well-known haven for fugitives which has no international extradition treaties. \n",
      " A 10th suspect arrested in Sunday's swoop, flame-haired Russian bombshell Anna Chapman, had her bail request turned down by Ellis on Monday. \n",
      " Bharara's letter also revealed that some 90 messages decrypted by the FBI have not yet been made public and that a raid on a safe-deposit box, after the arrest of the 10 suspects on Sunday, had yielded yet more evidence. \n",
      " \"Among the items recovered from the safe-deposit box were eight unmarked envelopes -- each of which contained 10,000 dollars, in apparently 100 dollar bills,\" the attorney said. \n",
      " Nine suspects face a maximum of 25 years in jail for money laundering as well as another five years for conspiring to work for a foreign government. Chapman and one other only face the lesser conspiracy charges. None of the 11 were charged with the more serious offense of espionage. \n",
      " The White House has said President Barack Obama knew the FBI was closing in on the suspects when he hosted Russian President Dmitry Medvedev at a summit three days before the arrests. \n",

      " News the controls would end came just hours after finance minister Pridiyathorn Devakula's surprise resignation Wednesday, creating a new crisis of confidence in a government whose popularity has plummeted since it took power after a coup five months ago. \n",
      " When the capital controls were imposed in mid-December, they sparked the biggest one-day crash in the history of Thailand's bourse, and forced the government to quickly rescind some of the measures. \n",

      " \"Yves Saint Laurent died Sunday at 11:10 pm,\" announced his foundation, the Pierre-Berge-Saint Laurent Foundation. \n",
      " The reclusive French maestro, who had retired from haute couture in 2002 after four decades at the top of his trade, had been ill for some time. \n",
      " During his farewell appearance seven years ago, Saint Laurent had told reporters he had \"always given the highest importance of all to respect for this craft, which is not exactly an art, but which needs an artist to exist.\" \n",
      " One of a handful of designers who dominated 20th century fashion -- on a par with Christian Dior, Coco Chanel and Paul Poiret -- Yves Henri Donat Mathieu Saint Laurent was born in the coastal town of Oran, Algeria, on August 1, 1936, at a time when the North African country was still considered part of France. \n",
      " A shy, lonely, child, he became fascinated by clothes, and already had a solid portfolio of sketches when he first arrived in Paris in 1953, aged 17. \n",

      " Discerning the young man's potential, de Brunoff advised Christian Dior to hire him and he rapidly emerged as heir apparent to the great couturier, taking over the house when Dior died suddenly three years later. \n",
      " Saint Laurent would say of his mentor: \"Dior fascinated me. I couldn't speak in front of him. He taught me the basis of my art. Whatever was to happen next, I never forgot the years spent at his side.\" \n",
      " However in 1960, like many Frenchmen of his age, Saint Laurent was called up to fight in his native Algeria, where an independence war was under way. \n",
      " Less than three weeks later he won an exemption on health grounds, but when he returned to Paris it was to learn that Dior had already found a replacement for him, in the person of Marc Bohan. \n",
      " With his close associate and lover Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent resolved to strike out on his own, with Berge taking care of the business side. \n",
      " Saint Laurent's success lay in the harmony he achieved between body and garment -- what he called \"the total silence of clothing.\" \n",
      " He was also in the right place at the right time. Having learned his trade at the house of Dior, he founded his own couture house at the start of the 1960s, at a time when the world was changing and there was a new appetite for originality. \n",
      " Saint Laurent rode his luck through the rise of the youth market and pop culture fuelled by the economic boom of the 1960s, when women suddenly had more economic freedom. \n",
      " His name and the familiar YSL logo became synonymous with all the latest trends, highlighted by the creation of the Rive Gauche ready-to-wear label and perfume, as well as astute licensing deals for accessories and perfumes. \n",
      " Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, he set the pace for fashion around the world, opening up the Japanese market and subsequently expanding to South Korea and Taiwan. \n",
      " Among his many fans in his native France was the actress Catherine Deneuve, who was always to be seen at his shows. \n",
      " Berge, speaking Sunday on France's LCI television, called Saint Laurent a fashion revolutionary. \n",
      " \"He knew perfectly well that he had revolutionised haute couture, the important place he occupied in the second half of the 20th century,\" he said. \n",
      " But Saint Laurent's career was not without controversy. In 1971 a collection modelled on the styles of World War II Paris was slammed by some American critics, and his launch in the mid 1970s of a perfume called \"Opium\" brought accusations that he was condoning drug use. \n",
      " For fellow-designer Christian Lacroix, the reason for Saint Laurent's success was his astonishing versatility. There had, Lacroix said, been other great designers but none with the same range. \n",
      " \"Chanel, Schiaparelli, Balenciaga and Dior all did extraordinary things. But they worked within a particular style,\" he explained. \"Yves Saint Laurent is much more versatile, like a combination of all of them. I sometimes think he's got the form of Chanel with the opulence of Dior and the wit of Schiaparelli.\" \n"

      "A new dawn looked likely for Manchester United after Alex Ferguson's team won the European Champions League in Moscow in May to complete a domestic and European double. \n",
      " That night on May 21 when Edwin van der Sar saved Nicolas Anelka's spotkick to secure United's third European Cup at the expense of Chelsea in the Luzhniki Stadium had been expected to herald further great things from the Red Devils this season. \n",
      " Not only had United retained their Premier League title, they had delivered another crushing blow to closest rivals Chelsea by ensuring that they ended the season without silverware. \n",
      " Yet with United ready to launch the new season at home to Newcastle on August 17, a week after contesting the Community Shield against FA Cup winners Portsmouth, they will face Kevin Keegan's team having endured a turbulent closed season that has witnessed the departure of key personnel, the drawn-out saga over Cristiano Ronaldo's future and an absence of any new signings. \n",
      " United's position of strength that appeared so impregnable two months ago is now not looking quite so formidable. Liverpool's squad rebuilding has increased expectations of a title push at Anfield and Luiz Felipe Scolari's arrival as Chelsea manager appears to have injected new belief into last season's dejected squad. \n",
      " So where do United go now having lost Ferguson's trusted assistant, Carlos Queiroz, to the Portugal national team and with Ronaldo, sidelined through injury until October, continuing to make disruptive noises about his desire to move to Real Madrid? \n",
      " All is likely to become clear inside the opening month of the new campaign, with Ferguson's men facing a difficult start to the defence of their title. After entertaining Newcastle, United travel to Portsmouth before back-to-back away games at Liverpool and Chelsea in September. \n",
      " If they emerge unbeaten that demanding opening, which also sees them tackle Zenit St Petersburg in Monaco for the UEFA Super Cup on August 29, then the summer of strife will be quickly forgotten. \n",
      " Queiroz's departure is likely to prove a major loss for Ferguson, however. \n",
      " At 66, the United manager had delegated many coaching and organisational responsibilities to the former Real Madrid manager and Ferguson admitted recently that his plans to take short breaks away from the club this season have been scuppered by Queiroz's exit. \n",
      " While the coaching team of Mike Phelan, Rene Meulensteen and Brian McClair will combine to ease the day-to-day burden on Ferguson, Queiroz's tactical brain, his scouting contacts and his invaluable ability to communicate freely with fellow Portuguese speakers Ronaldo, Nani and Anderson, will all be sorely missed. \n",
      " Coping with Queiroz's loss, rather than the troublesome Ronaldo, will be Ferguson's main challenge. \n",
      " Having firmly ruled out the sale of Ronaldo, Ferguson has proved on many occasions in the past his ability to get the best out of even the most difficult characters and the 23-year-old will be expected to fall back into line on the pitch once he recovers from his ankle injury. \n",
      " Should Ferguson succeed in his efforts to sign the Spurs striker Dimitar Berbatov, then the Bulgarian would give the European champions a more potent attacking edge and ease the goalscoring burden on Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney, who at times last season appeared to be in desperate need of an experienced strike partner. \n",
      " Berbatov's flair and physical presence would appear to be perfectly suited to playing alongside Rooney and, with the Argentinian forward Carlos Tevez also at Ferguson's disposal, United would clearly possess a strike-force capable of destroying even the best defences. \n",
      " But as the new season looms, United will once again begin as favourites to win the Premier League title. Despite the upheaval of Queiroz's departure and Ronaldo's refusal to distance himself from the Real Madrid links, United continue to possess in Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic perhaps the Premier League's best defensive pairing. \n",
      " They also can still rely on the craft of Paul Scholes, the growing maturity of midfielder Michael Carrick and the industry of Owen Hargreaves. \n",
      " With or without the injured Ronaldo, United remain a fearsome attacking unit and it will take a formidable team to dethrone them in England and in Europe this season.: [20664, 19939, 18607]\n",

      " Kasprowicz, who has been one of Australia's best bowlers over  the last six months, was named 12th man while 35-year-old Lehmann's  Test career could be over after a poor sequence of scores. \n",
      " Reports said that captain Ricky Ponting debated the team's  make-up with selector Allan Border before and during training before  announcing to the media the sacking of Kasprowicz and Lehmann  despite Australia's 2-0 unassailable series lead over Pakistan. \n",
      " \"We think it's the best balanced side for this opposition and  these conditions,\" Ponting told his match-eve media conference. \n",

      " The pitch was expected to provide significant turn over the  final three days when MacGill and Shane Warne will bowl in tandem. \n",

      "Thousands of demonstrators on Saturday gathered around the offices of 34 broadcasters that were taken off the air in Venezuela after President Hugo Chavez argued they abused free speech. \n",
      " Protestors railed against what they described as censorship, denouncing Chavez's leftist government as a \"dictatorship\" in chants. \n",
      " Earlier crowds gathered in front of the national telecommunications regulator Conatel, which announced the closures. \n",
      " Conatel's head, Diosdado Cabello, said Friday that 32 radio stations and two television stations would be shut down in the latest bid to tighten reins on the media as Chavez advances his leftist-populist program. \n",
      " \"It is not that we have shut some radio stations, we are implementing the law. We have put them back in the hands of the people and not the bourgeoisie,\" Chavez said in a televised address on Saturday. \n",
      " Cabello said the closures were due to the stations' failures to meet legal operating requirements. The government has warned another 200 stations may face the same fate. \n",
      " As some stations fell silent, there were hundreds of supporters in Caracas and other cities voicing opposition to the move. \n",
      " Carlos Correa, director of the free speech NGO Espacio Publico, argued that the government is trying to \"break national-level means of offering critical or independent content.\" \n",
      " \"We are witnessing the largest ever clampdown on free speech Venezuela has ever seen, unprecedented in its democratic era,\" Correa said. \n",
      " He also expressed outrage that the government's new draft legislation on \"media crimes\" could send journalists to prison, and contains other proposed new legal limits on journalistic expression. \n",
      " One of the leading radio networks silenced Saturday was CNB -- with five affiliates in Caracas, Valencia, Maracaibo, San Cristobal and Coro. Its news and feature programming was often critical of Chavez's government. \n",
      " But Cabello insisted that the move was not censorship. He said there were procedural legal problems in all the cases of shutdowns, such as lapsed licenses and improper license transfers. \n",
      " Radio is an important medium in Venezuela and News and Communications Minister Blanca Eekhout has charged there is an \"international media campaign against the Venezuelan revolution,\" which she said made it necessary to step up media regulation. \n",
      " \"If media crimes cannot be prosecuted we will all be completely vulnerable,\" she said. \n",

      " And it's harder for people to believe in the amazing now that dope cheats have stolen credibility from astonishing feats and left sports fans worldwide skeptical at best. \n",

      " Roe hopes that blood testing, making its debut at these trials, and a new extensive testing random testing program by the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) beyond World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) guidelines have some impact. \n",
      " \"We have been surprised once or twice by athletes,\" Roe said. \"In my heart of hearts I don't want these situations to devalue the sport. I rely on WADA and USADA to take care of that.\" \n",
      " Even if it means another shocker to a superstar, such as Ben Johnson's 1988 doping disqualification at the Seoul Olympics. \n",
      " \"If that's what it takes to get the sport clean, we will go through that. If it means catching a marquee athlete, that's what it takes,\" Roe said. \"We have to think about the kids. We have to think about the future here.\" \n",
      " While Roe says prize money is not enough to spark chemists into dope cheat frenzies, the sponsorship deals like those which will bring Gay two million dollars this year would lure wrongdoers. \n",
      " Some athletes have served doping suspensions and returned to qualify for the Olympics, such as Torri Edwards who reached Beijing in the 100 on Saturday. But Roe wonders if all is forgiven by fans. \n",
      " \"I think the general public views them with some nuance of skepticism and rightfully so,\" Roe said. \"Some people will not forgive when they feel they have been lied to. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me again...\" \n",
      " But what about the possibility of accidental doping? \n",
      " \"That's why we have a system where you can return to the sport,\" Roe said. \"You don't know entirely 100 percent whether it's the athlete's fault. America is famous for giving people second chances.\" \n",

      " BEIJING, Oct.1 (Xinhua) -- In his most recent trip to China in  early June, European Union (EU) Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson was awed at the huge volume of goods headed for Europe that \"still aren't even slightly matched by trade flowing in the other  direction.\" \n",
      " After visiting the container terminal of Maersk Logistics  (China) in Shenzhen, a bustling port city in south China's  Guangdong Province that neighbors Hong Kong, Mandelson complained  that three out of every four containers sent from Shenzhen to the  EU came back empty. \n",
      " The remark highlighted the concerns of China's major trade  partners in Europe and the United States, who are struck by the  scale and pace of China's economic resurgence since the country  began its epoch-making reform and opening in the early 1980s. They worry that the flood of made-in-China goods will impinge on their  own domestic industries. \n",
      " \"The case of containers is a good example of the real trade  relations between China and the EU,\" said Chinese Ministry of  Commerce spokesman Chong Quan. \n",
      " \"Seventy percent of China's exports to the European Union are  labor-intensive products with low value and high quantity, while  80 percent of imports from the European Union are capital and  technology-intensive products with high value and limited  quantity,\" said Chong. \n",
      " \"An Airbus aircraft China purchases from the European Union  equals 80 million pairs of shoes exported by China in terms of  value,\" Chong said. \"China-European Union trade is strongly  complementary and mutually beneficial.\" \n",
      " However, many European and American analysts disagree with  Chong's characterization. One thing is certain: China's success  story stokes protectionist instincts and is the acid test of  countries' commitment to free trade across the world. \n",

In recent years, China's GDP growth averaged 9.4  percent a year, far higher than the rate of global economic  growth. Exports are growing faster than imports. China's trade  surplus more than tripled from 32 billion U.S. dollars in 2004 to  a record 102 billion dollars in 2005, the 12th consecutive annual  surplus. In the first half of this year, China chalked up a  61.5-billion-dollar surplus, up 54.9 percent year-on-year,  according to General Administration of Customs statistics. \n",
      " China's trade surplus with the US was 80 billion dollars in  2004 and exceeded 110 billion dollars in 2005, according to  official statistics. With a growing trade surplus, China is under  pressure from the United States to raise the exchange rate of the  yuan: many American economists attributed their country's  increasing trade deficit to the RMB's fixed peg, which they said  had prevented the Chinese currency from its natural tendency to  appreciate in value against the dollar. \n"

      " Though dubbed \"Genetic Engineering or Organic: Which Future For Agriculture?\", the press conference hosted by Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology (RFSTE) and International Forum for Agriculture (IFA) here this afternoon turned out to be a gathering of pure critics of the introduction of genetic engineering (GE) in farming and foods.  \n",
      " \"We are trying to form an international coalition against GE products, which are being introduced across the world,\" said Dr. Vandana Shiva, director of RFSTE, an India-based environment activist group.  \n",
      " They might sound a bit radical and biased, but one after hearing their stories would surely feel they are not worrying for nothing.  \n",
      " \"Five years ago, genetically engineered rape seeds were introduced in our region, which were claimed to be more nutritious with better yields and less use of chemicals. But now they have turned out to be less yielding and less nutritional and the chemical cost goes up 6 times more than originally thought,\" said Percy Schmeiser, a farmer from Saskatchewan, Canada.  \n",
      " Moreover, Schmeiser, who claimed to have spent 15 years developing his own rape seeds and have chosen not to use the GE seeds, was sued by Monsanto, the world's leading GE seeds distributor, for \"intellectual theft\" as the GE seeds crossed into his land from his neighbors' fields.  \n",
      " \"I was forced to launch a counter-suit against Monsanto for developing a 'super-weed' they themselves cannot control,\" said Schmeiser, who is still fighting the legal battle.  \n",

      " As soon as he released his report, he found himself against the \"whole scientific establishment\" and faced enormous pressure from the biotechnology industry, said Pusztai, adding that \"some scientists are also genetically modified by the genetic modification industry\".  \n",
      " Ellen Hickey, one of the founders of the U.S.-based Genetic Engineered Food Alert Organization, said that contrary to the impression that GE food is warmly welcomed in America, many consumers have no idea what the supermarkets are selling to them, and that \"once they learn the truth, their reaction range from sorrow to anger\".  \n",
      " While consumers in rich countries are rejecting GE foods and forcing the authorities to recall them from store shelves, developing nations like India are \"being flooded with untested unlabeled genetically engineered foods\", said a leaflet distributed by the RFSTE.  \n",
      " Genetically modified seeds and crops could also infuse toxins in the soil, contaminate genes of native plants and reduce bio- diversity, heighten the financial burden of poor farmers and lead to agricultural monopoly by multinational bio-tech corporations, said participants of the press conference, some of them also from Peru, South Africa and Sri Lanka.  \n",
      " \"We are seeking a 10-year moratorium on commercialization of genetic engineering in food and farming in the country,\" said Vandana Shiva. She was echoed by Glenda Lindsay from South Africa, who is also heading a coalition in her country seeking a five-year freeze on GE products.  \n",
      " Dr. Pushba Bhargava, former director of India's Central Council of Microbiology, said that efforts should be made to prompt the government to strengthen testing of GE products and educate the farmers not to sign \"blind contracts\" while purchasing seeds.  \n",
      " However, all the opponents of GE products should know exactly what a mighty enemy they are fighting with, especially when there are still so many governments and so many people in the world that view genetic engineering as a fruit of hi-tech revolution and a propeller to agricultural production, in both quantity and quality.  \n",
      " Will Allen, a farmer from the United States, claimed that he and his fellow cotton growers had no other choice but genetically modified seeds, although such seeds had caused yield losses in all 18 U.S. southern states.  \n",
      " \"We were forced by banks and seed companies to do so,\" said Allen, adding that while he and other farmers voluntarily formed a research group on organic farming, they could get no money from either the government or research institutes.  \n",
      " In India, Agriculture Minister Nitish Kumar has stated that it is imperative to adopt genetic engineering in Indian agriculture because of increase in productivity. The minister, however, also called for a debate on biotechnology.  \n",

      " Still, Shiva, Allen and their fellows believe they have every reason to be optimistic.  \n",

      " That was up from a 3.7 percent rate in the final quarter of 1997 and was the fastest pace in a year.  \n",
      " Increased computer purchases by both individuals and businesses were the main motive power for the step-up in first-quarter economic growth. Excluding it, the economy would have grown at a 3.5 percent pace, the department said.  \n",

The combination produced the worst deterioration in the U.S. trade deficit on record for the past half century.  \n",

      " At the same time, a massive public information campaign on AIDS was launched in early 1990s in Thailand.  \n",
      " Intensive public information on HIV/AIDS prevention was launched through the mass media, including mandatory one-minute AIDS education spots every hour on television and radio.  \n",
      " The messages emphasized prevention, behavior change, condom use and AIDS as not just a health problem but a social problem.  \n",
      " All ministries were actively involved in providing education and training to their staff and population groups they work with.  \n",
      " The ministry of education launched peer education programs among students and an annual national competition among school children at different levels in essay writing on HIV/AIDS, greatly raising their level of awareness.  \n",
      " In 1991, the \"100 Percent Condom Program\" was adopted nationwide to promote universal use of condoms in commercial sex all the time.  \n",
      " The public health ministry purchased 53 million pieces of condom in 1996 for free distribution to high-risk groups.  \n",
      " As a result, condom use by sex workers in Thailand rose from about 14 percent in 1988 to more than 93 percent in 1997, which made a great contribution to the fall of HIV infection rates.  \n",
      " Government's efforts apart, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector also played a key role in reducing new HIV infection in the general public and the impact of the AIDS problem on the socioeconomic and health status of the population, two key objectives set forth by Thailand's Nation Plan for Prevention and Alleviation of HIV/AIDS, 1997-2000.  \n",
      " The number of NGOs involved with AIDS increased from 23 to 184 between 1992 and 1997.  \n",

      "The Dodgers have decided not to declare an incumbency at their shortstop position, but will attempt to trade Jose Offerman if he doesn't win the starting job next spring. \n",
      " \"He needs to reclaim the job or have a change of scenery,\" Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said this week. \"If he isn't going to be our starting shortstop, and he's not serving some other role in our lineup, I think (moving him) would be in his best interest, and ours.\" \n",
      " Neither Offerman nor his agent, Adam Katz, was available for comment. \n",
      " Offerman, 26, has not been the Dodgers' starting shortstop since June 27, when he was demoted to Class-AAA Albuquerque and replaced by slick-fielding but light-hitting Rafael Bournigal. The Dodgers were 38-36 before the move, 20-20 after it, but seemed refreshed by the decision to no longer coddle the struggling fourth-year infielder. \n",
      " To his credit, Offerman didn't sulk at Albuquerque. He hit .330 and scored 43 runs in 56 games for the Dukes, after batting just .210 with a team-leading 11 errors in 72 games for Los Angeles. He made 13 more errors at Albuquerque, second highest on the Dukes behind third baseman Ron Coomer's 19. \n",
      " Bournigal hit .224 in L.A. but made only three errors in 40 games and struck out only five times in 116 at-bats (once per 23.2 at-bats). Offerman fanned 38 times in 243 at-bats (once per 6.4 at-bats). \n",
      " Bournigal, still qualified as a rookie at age 28, began playing for manager Art Howe's Azucareros team when the Dominican Winter League opened last month. Offerman, who is to earn $1.6 million next year in the second year of his guaranteed two-year contract, plans to join the Licey team in the Dominican next week. \n",
      " Claire stopped short of tabbing Bournigal as the incumbent, and said Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda was planning to scout both shortstops personally before the Dominican season ended. \n",
      " \"Right now, if we started spring training tomorrow, we'd simply have Jose and Bournigal competing for the job,\" Claire said. \"Jose had the job and Bournigal took it. But we're not going to get tied up in how it's worded. Spring training will determine it. We've come to the conclusion we'll let the best man win the job.\" \n",
      " If the best man isn't Offerman, Claire said he saw \"nothing productive\" in sending him back to the minor leagues. Nor did Claire see much potential in Offerman switching positions to third base or the outfield. \n",
      " \"It's been talked about in the past, but it's not something we have on the drawing board,\" Claire said. \"I think Jose has the athletic ability (to make a position change), but the number one thing is that he doesn't want to do that.

      " \"I guess he was attracted to the knife,\" store clerk, Jose Camacho, said in testimony after Wattenberg. \"It's a nice-looking knife. And he just -- he just liked it.\" \n",
      " The testimony of Camacho was made more striking when he conceded he was paid $12,500 by the tabloid The National Enquirer for his story about selling the folding knife. \n",
      " Wattenberg testified that the payment would be split between Camacho, him and his brother, Richard Wattenberg, a co-owner of the story. \n",
      " Asked by Shapiro whether he had been told by prosecutors not to talk to anybody about the Simpson case, Camacho -- who testified before the Los Angeles County grand jury -- replied that he had been given conflicting orders. \n",
      " He explained that while prosecutors had told him not to talk, \"this lady, Patti -- she works for the district attorney -- said that we could if we wanted to. \n",
      " \"She told us that people talk to the press,\" Camacho said. \n",
      " \"Are you a little uncertain about this, Mr. Camacho?\" asked Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman. \n",
      " \"Yes,\" the witness replied. \n",
      " The grand jury hearing evidence in the case against Simpson was disbanded last week by a judge who said he believed that some jurors had been tainted by pre-trial publicity in the case. \n",
      " Camacho said he was under a lot of pressure to talk when the media descended on the store days after the killings. \n",
      " \"I was lying because I was told to lie,\" he said. When he learned the Enquirer was paying someone else money for less information than he had, Camacho said he decided to talk. \n",
      " \"I wanted to stop lying,\" he said, adding that he found the media to be \"tricky people.\" Camacho also testified that the television tabloid, \"Hard Copy,\" had offered to pay him for his story, but it was only \"some peanuts.\" \n",
      " Camacho testified that he sold Simpson the knife for $74.98, which Simpson paid for with a $100 bill, although the store kept no written record of the sale. \n",

      "Derek Harper will miss another All-Star Game, but he enjoyed another stellar performance on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden. \n",
      " Helping the Knicks avoid what would have been a shocking loss, Harper made two crucial 3-point jumpers during the final two and a half minutes to lift New York to a shaky 90-87 victory over the injury-riddled Golden State Warriors. \n",
      " What was expected to be a rout was almost stolen by the Warriors, who slowed the tempo, double-teamed Patrick Ewing aggressively and never allowed the Knicks to control the game. \n",
      " It came down to the final two minutes, and thanks to Harper, who scored a season-high 26 points and shot 7 for 10 from 3-point range, the Knicks prevailed. New York (28-14) has won 16 of last 18 games, and while this was far from a classic, the performance was a lot easier for the Knicks to accept because they still got the victory. Hitting a club-record 13 3-point shots certainly helped. \n",
      " \"Whether it should have been this close or not, you have to give them a lot of credit,\" Coach Pat Riley said of the Warriors. \"They slowed this down to a walk. They played a very good game. The important thing is to keep it in perspective. I know everybody thinks it should've been a blowout. They came in with a very solid game plan of controlling the tempo and isolating. They were not going to let us post-up anything. \n",
      " \"It is important to win games no matter what the style being played. Derek Harper played like the All-Star that he wasn't voted, which is a travesty. He is probably the best player ever in this game to not be voted to an All-Star team. He made every big shot we needed.\" \n",
      " But even with Harper's heroics, the Knicks almost let victory slip away in the final seconds. With New York leading by 89-87, Anthony Mason threw an errant inbounds pass from underneath the Warriors's basket that was intercepted by David Wood at midcourt. \n",
      " The Warriors (12-28) worked the ball to Ryan Lorthridge, who launched a 3-point jumper from the deep right corner with about 10 seconds to play. Lorthridge missed. Hubert Davis rebounded, and he was fouled with 8.4 seconds left. Davis made just one of two free throws, leaving New York with a 90-87 lead, and the Warriors still had a chance to tie with a three-point jumper. \n",
      " After a timeout, Golden State inbounded to Tim Hardaway, who drove against Harper above the top of the key. When Hardaway veered to his left, he was picked up by Mason, who forced Hardaway (24 points) to pick up his dribble behind the 3-point line, then launch an off-balance 3-pointer from about 24 feet with three seconds to play. The shot bounced wildly off the glass no good. The buzzer sounded, and the Knicks had escaped. \n",
      " \"I'm just happy we were able to get way with a win,\" said Ewing (19 points, 14 rebounds), who helped the Knicks erase a 51-41 deficit in the third quarter. \"For me, it was very frustrating because they did a lot of trapping and double-teamed me. It could have gone either way.\" \n",
      " Harper made one three-pointer that gave New York an 83-80 lead with 2:29 left, then another three-pointer by Harper put New York ahead, 88-83, with 23.7 seconds to play. \n",
      " Earlier in the day, Harper was not included among the Eastern Conference All-Star reserves, and he has never made the All-Star team in 12 seasons. But Harper did not share Riley's deep disappointment about being snubbed again. \n",
      " \"I didn't really expect it,\" Harper said. \"It's not the end of the world. I'll enjoy my time off.\" \n"

      "Gunmen backing army rule scattered a demonstration of supporters of Haiti's elected president Friday as U.S. soldiers, deployed blocks away in tanks surrounded by barbed wire, did nothing to stop the violence. \n",
      " Rifle and pistol shots rang out, rocks flew, and machetes and clubs flailed as a score of the plainclothes auxiliaries known as attaches swaggered out of their hangout in the Normandie Bar and an office of the paramilitary party known as Fraph to block several thousand marchers marking the third anniversary of the military coup that overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. \n",
      " Journalists counted at least eight bodies in the streets after the clashes, most of them shot by the attaches. But at least two, identified as attaches, were apparently beaten to death by demonstrators. \n",
      " The marchers, growing hesitant and nervous a little before noon as their route took them near a street corner long controlled by the attaches, wildly cheered the first appearance of a U.S. convoy. They danced, pulling U.S. flags from their pockets and shouting, \"The Americans have truly liberated us!\" \n",
      " But the Americans quickly drove off, as did others that followed, and the mood grew bitter toward the U.S. soldiers as it became clear that the U.S. force in Haiti, now more than 20,000 strong, would not provide protection to the marchers. \n",
      " Demonstrators ran back and forth, trying to get away as gunfire came from the Fraph offices, from a nearby penitentiary and from gunmen on the street. An attache knelt behind a wall, aiming an M-1 rifle. A Haitian driver for a U.S. television network, taking shelter with his crew on a porch, was shot dead at point-blank range by an attache with a pistol. There were bodies in the street and people beaten bloody being dragged off. \n",
      " Friday afternoon, long after the crackle of gunfire had died down and the demonstrators had run away down the side streets, a 24-year-old student who gave his name as Jean-Louis stood in a glum clump of people under a tree near the Holiday Inn, staring at a Sheridan tank whose cannon barrel bore the inscription \"House of Pain.\" \n",
      " \"I can't believe what I see now,\" he said. \"The American soldiers were supposed to be here to help us. They were to restore democracy and protect us from the machine guns of the Fraph people.\" \n",
      " At a briefing Friday afternoon, U.S. officials put the blame for not keeping order on the Haitian police, the very force that only two weeks ago was described by President Clinton as an integral part of a repressive apparatus so vile it demanded U.S. intervention. \n",
      " \"Our mission was and still is not to serve as the police for the country of Haiti,\" said Col. Barry Willey, the military spokesman. \n",
      " In fact, a lone blue pickup truck carrying about a dozen helmeted blue-shirted Haitian policemen, some with rifles, did pull up sometime after 1 p.m., just in time to send the last dozen or so demonstrators fleeing. The police got out leisurely and stood in the shade. \n",
      " Four other times, however, police trucks were seen loading up the armed men in civilian clothes by the Fraph headquarters and racing off. \n",
      " (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) \n",
      " Early Friday morning, in preparation for the demonstration, planned and announced in advance by Aristide's supporters, U.S. soldiers, including paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division and Special Forces, were out in strength, setting up positions around Sheridan tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, and manning machine guns mounted atop the utility vehicles called Humvees. \n",
      " Some of the vehicles carried police riot shields. \n",
      " But the U.S. soldiers were nowhere near the announced route of the march to the city cemetery from the Basilica of Notre Dame, where a requiem Mass was celebrated for the more than 3,000 people whom human rights groups say were killed during military rule. \n",
      " Instead, their positions were set up along Avenue John Brown, a main commercial street in the center of town running up the mountains to Petionville, an upper-class residential district, and around the Holiday Inn and a few other intersections. \n",
      " This deployment was apparently intended to protect commercial establishments and prevent any crowds from going up the hill toward the homes of the wealthy. Where the road grows steeper near the edge of town, two bright yellow fire trucks, marked the Fort Drum Fire Department, from the home of the 10th Mountain Division, were parked on the side of the road, in a position to hose down demonstrators. \n",
      " Willey, the military spokesman, said the troops were positioned to form \"a cordon to allow the Haitian police and authorities to work the inner perimeter.\" \n",
      " \"The mission today was to contain the crowd\" and \"create a stable atmosphere so the demonstration could go on as planned,\" Colonel Willey said. \"Our intent was was to control and deter and not to get involved in the inner workings of the march.\" \n",
      " A U.S. military police detachment took over the Haitian radio and television building Friday morning and cut off its programming, which had consisted largely of diatribes against President Aristide and the Americans. \n",
      " The day had dawned with another round of looting in the port, part of a wave of sackings of food warehouses and stores in the last few days. United Nations officials said that nine aid agency warehouses have been looted. At a U.N. storehouse near the airport, they said, looters took not only 11 tons of food and other supplies but also the 240 wooden shipping pallets the boxes stood on. \n",
      " A crowd broke into the Cash and Carry supermarket early Friday morning, knocking a hole in the wall to pass out the food more rapidly. Sacks of sugar, bags of rice and canned goods -- Carnation concentrated milk was particularly prized -- disappeared into the crowd. Some people fought in the street over the bags of rice, while others placed orders with looters. U.S. soldiers eventually arrived and chased the looters off. \n",
      " The Mass and march to commemorate the army coup that ousted Aristide had been talked about for days, but after Thursday's attack in the port area, where at least five people were killed when a grenade was hurled into a peaceful crowd, many organizations told their supporters to stay home. \n",

      "As he stood in center field on Tuesday afternoon while nobody could score, there was only one thing on Brian McRae's mind from the 10th inning on: he was starving. So was Bernard Gilkey over in left. So was Butch Huskey, who had resorted to eating blades of grass in right to placate his stomach on an opening day that could not seem to end. \n",
      " There was a different thought running through Alberto Castillo's mind in the Mets' bullpen after the top of the 14th inning of a scoreless game: he was thirsty. So Castillo, who had been in the pen from the fifth inning on, walked over to the kitchen near the Mets' clubhouse to get some hot chocolate for himself and bullpen coach Randy Niemann. \n",
      " The kitchen was where Castillo saw coach Bruce Benedict on television using the dugout phone. Realizing that he was the only position player whom manager Bobby Valentine had left, Castillo figured the call was meant for him. \n",
      " So much for the drinks. The backup catcher had figured right. Minutes later, he was being mobbed by his teammates after he delivered a full-count, two-out, pinch-hit single to right with the bases loaded off Philadelphia closer Ricky Bottalico to give the Mets a 1-0 victory in 14 innings on a gorgeous day at Shea Stadium. \n",
      " It was the longest a scoreless game had gone on opening day since April 13, 1926, when the Washington Senators prevailed over the Philadelphia Athletics, 1-0, in 15 innings. The Mets hold the distinction of being involved in the longest scoreless game in major league history, a 1-0 loss to Houston in 24 innings on April 15, 1968. \n",
      " On Tuesday, Castillo made sure the line of zeroes on the scoreboard did not get near that mark as he became a most unlikely hero before what was left of the 49,142 fans. \n",
      " Castillo came in as a .192 career hitter, but Valentine had no other choice. Not after McRae had slipped rounding third two at-bats earlier, while third-base coach Cookie Rojas was trying to wave him home on a Bernard Gilkey single to left. Not after Luis Lopez had popped up to third baseman Scott Rolen on a 3-2 count for the second out with the bases now loaded and reliever Turk Wendell's spot in the order coming up next. \n",
      " Up stepped Castillo. Had the game gone on any further, Valentine said, his next option would have been to send the left-handed pitcher Brian Bohanon up to pinch-hit in the pitcher's spot. Castillo made that unnecessary after falling behind one ball, two strikes in the count. \n",
      " But then Bottalico got behind, 3-2, \"and he paid for it,\" said Castillo, who took a very close pitch for ball three. \"I think he was getting too tired.\" \n",
      " Bottalico, who was in his third inning, came back at Castillo with another fastball at 3-2, just as he had when Lopez had popped up. Castillo singled to right and McRae crossed home. After 4 hours 35 minutes, someone had finally scored. \n",
      " That didn't make the previously unheard of chants of \"Cas-till-o! Cas-till-o!\" seem so funny anymore. \n",
      " \"I know what's thought about Albert,\" Valentine said. \"But I managed him in Class AAA. And he'll have some ugly at-bats. But the one thing I always say in my meetings is he gives you a good one when you need it. And he gave us one there.\" \n",
      " The game was reminiscent of many of the struggles the Mets went through on their way to 88 victories a year ago. Except for one thing: on Tuesday, the bullpen came through. \n",
      " A year ago on opening day in San Diego, the Mets allowed 11 fifth-inning runs. On Tuesday, over the final eight innings, five New York relievers _ Greg McMichael, Dennis Cook, John Franco, Mel Rojas and Wendell _ allowed not one run in relief of Bobby Jones, who yielded four hits. \n",
      " \"Last year's bullpen gave up 11, this year's bullpen gave up zilch,\" said Franco, who retired the side with two men on in the 10th. \"You have to give credit to our pen. Hopefully, it was a good indication of how deep our bullpen is.\" \n",
      " Wendell, who was credited with the victory despite pitching with what he said was not his best stuff, said he was especially happy for Rojas, who was often booed at Shea after coming over from the Cubs with Wendell and McRae last Aug. 8. \n",
      " Wendell said: \"I know what he went through last year. \"I wanted him to get off to a good start. I think that I thought he had more pressure on himself last year. And I felt bad for him. So I'm very happy that he pitched well to start it off.\" \n",
      " Everybody pitched well on Tuesday, but no one was better than the Philadelphia starter, Curt Schilling, who set a National League record last season for most strikeouts (319) by a right-handed pitcher. Schilling struck out nine Mets and did not allow a runner past first base as he yielded only a pair of singles to catcher Tim Spehr. Although they had more base runners, the Phillies could not score off Bobby Jones either. And then the bullpen did its job. \n",
      " \"All I can say about that is last year's over,\" Spehr said. \"Every single one of those guys went out there today and did an outstanding job. And there's no doubt in my mind these guys can do this on an everyday basis.\" \n",
      " That cannot be said with as much certainty for Castillo, the embodiment of good field, no hit. \n",
      " Castillo knew he could not take any borderline pitches. \n"

      "Isaiah Kacyvenski has a great story to tell. \n",
      " It goes beyond the hyperactive linebacker being the highest-round draft choice ever from Harvard. It goes much deeper than what a storybook ending it would be if the Seahawks' fourth-round pick can become the run-stuffing middle linebacker the team seeks. \n",
      " \"It is a wonderful story,\" coach and general manager Mike Holmgren said Sunday after the final practice of Seattle's three-day minicamp. \"It is absolutely wonderful.\" \n",
      " But where to begin this saga of a kid from Endicott, N.Y., who has overcome being the youngest of five children of an alcoholic father and a mother who died during his senior year in high school? Who settled on Harvard as a third option? Who became a fourth-round draft choice despite not even being invited to the NFL scouting combine? Who unleashed the nervous energy that had built within him like a mushroom cloud while sitting through the first 118 selections of the draft by running around the block after Seattle finally selected him? \n",
      " The best place to start is where Kacyvenski's dream of playing in the NFL began. \n",
      " He was 8, and remembers listening to the Chicago Bears' Super Bowl XX victory over the New England Patriots on the radio because his father's drinking left no money for a TV _ or, at times, even food. \n",
      " \"The next day, I went to school and my friends and I started playing `Kill the man with the ball,' where you throw the ball up and everyone jumps on the guy who catches it,\" Kacyvenski said during a break at minicamp, the late-afternoon sun glistening in the sweat beaded on his shaved head. \"Every day, I'd come home with torn clothes and grass-stained clothes. \n",
      " \"But listening to that game on the radio was the start of the dream,\" he said. \"This is the dream come true.\" \n",
      " Kacyvenski's dream will be interrupted while he returns to Harvard, where he has papers due this week in each of his four classes _ the making of American governmental policy; historical studies; linguistics; and economics. \n",
      " \"Kind of boring classes,\" he said. \"Usually you get electives, where you get to take fun stuff. But I used all my electives to take pre-med requirements.\" \n",
      " He has waited this long, and endured so much: \n",
      " -- Family life. His father David has been sober for nine years. But these better times were preceded by turbulent times _ years when Isaiah was shielded from much of the harsh reality. \n",
      " \"I knew it was happening, but I kind of got sheltered from it by my brothers and sisters. And then I got so much love from my mother as a kid,\" Kacyvenski said. \"But my dad has turned his life around. I never get embarrassed. I'm proud of him.\" \n",
      " Isaiah is not his family's lone success story. His sisters are teachers. One of his brothers is an artist; the other just got out of the Marines. \n",
      " \"They're my rocks _ my brothers and sisters,\" he said. \n",
      " -- His mother's son. Margaret Kacyvenski died in a car accident Nov. 10, 1995. The next day, Isaiah played in a state high school quarterfinal at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse. \n",
      " \"It was tough,\" he said. \"Some people might have thought I was weird, playing in that game. But football has always been something I could lose myself in. So I played.\" \n",
      " What happened the following year was really weird. While going through his mother's possessions, Kacyvenski found her Bible, which included a highlighted passage from Isaiah 49 _ a hymn about a mother never forgetting her child. \n",
      " As a freshman at Harvard, Kacyvenski was issued No. 49, making him Isaiah 49. The Biblical passage still hangs in his locker. \n",
      " -- The unwanted. The star of this real-life, Rudy-esque tale wanted to attend the same school as the character who inspired the movie \"Rudy.\" But when Notre Dame did not have a spot for Kacyvenski, he committed to Connecticut. \n",
      " So how did he end up at Harvard? There are times when Kacyvenski wonders how it happened. \n",
      " \"If I didn't go to Notre Dame, I wanted to go to a huge Division I program,\" he said. \"I wanted to go somewhere where football was pretty important and the players made it their life. \n",
      " \"Once I got to Harvard, I met guys who were playing football because they loved it, not necessarily because they had to.\" \n",
      " Now, Kacyvenski is one of the square pegs who has found his niche in the round hole that is Harvard. He will graduate with a 3.2 GPA and has fulfilled his pre-med requirements. Medical school and becoming a pediatrician are in his future, but only after he has given football everything he has. \n",
      " -- The uninvited. When Kacyvenski was not invited to the combine, he started preparing for his private workout by working out with a personal trainer _ Mike Boyle, who helped Mike Mamula prepare for his pre-draft workouts before the Philadelphia Eagles made the undersized defensive end from Boston College the seventh pick overall in the 1995 draft. \n",
      " One problem. It took, and still takes, a four-hour bite from the middle of Kacyvenski's day to get to Boyle, complete the workout and return to Harvard. \n",
      " But it's time well spent. The 252-pound Kacyvenski wowed scouts by running 40 yards in 4.52 seconds, doing 30 bench-presses with 225 pounds and popping a 33{-inch vertical jump. \n",
      " \"I'm truly thankful for everything that's happened to me,\" he said. \"And I can't stop thinking about what a great opportunity this is.\" \n",

It was time for Coach Pat Riley to rest the starters, and why not? Everyone Riley called upon did something positive. \n",

      " After leading most of the half, the Knicks settled for a 46-41 lead at intermission. They had a scary moment with 51.4 seconds left in the second quarter, when Harper was called for a flagrant foul against Jason Kidd. \n",
      " Kidd used a pump fake to get Harper in the air, then as he attempted a layup, Harper swiped at the ball. He missed and hit Kidd in the head with his forearm. \n",

      " Mashburn propelled Dallas to a 17-10 lead. Mashburn abused both Anthony Bonner and Charles Smith in the first quarter, as neither Knick forward kept Mashburn from establishing deep low-post position. As a rookie, Mashburn was good. This season, he is better. \n",
      " But the game changed when the Knicks went to the bench. The Smith- Anthony Mason combination again gave New York an immediate lift. And Ewing was rock solid, leading the Knicks with 16 points in the half. Ewing had too much offense for Lorenzo Williams or Roy Tarpley. \n",

      " After Mashburn, the Dallas offense was a question mark. Kidd is a terrific playmaker, but he does not like to shoot his jumper, which is suspect. Yet the Mavericks compensated with a solid low-post attack that resulted in a steady diet of free throws. At halftime, the Mavericks were 13 for 20 from the line. By contrast, the Knicks were 1 for 3. \n",

      "With its bright hopes of challenging for the America's Cup beginning to dim, Paul Cayard's America One syndicate sailed a strong, confident race on Tuesday and scored a wire-to-wire victory over Italy's Prada Challenge in the fifth race of the five-of-nine-race Louis Vuitton Cup finals. \n",
      " Prada still maintains a 3-2 edge in the series to determine Team New Zealand's opponent in the America's Cup. That series will begin on Feb. 19. \n",
      " \"This is probably the hardest one to win of the four we've got to win,\" Cayard said. \"Tomorrow will be a good one. We'll get it to 3-3 and then we'll see how the other guys like the pressure.\" \n",
      " Cayard, in need of a victory after two straight defeats, took the action to his counterpart, Francesco de Angelis. First, Cayard tried unsuccessfully to coerce Prada into a prestart foul and hailed the race committee to protest the Italians _ but the umpires waved the green checkered flag. All clear. \n",
      " But he was not through. With about a minute to go to the starting gun, Cayard peeled out beyond the committee boat, but Prada, in control and right on his tail, had him seemingly pinned from escape. \n",
      " Holding port tack and with the seconds ticking, Cayard needed to flop over to starboard to gain steerage rights and make his move for the line. He needed, however, to create enough separation to avoid being called for an infraction for tacking too close. \n",
      " Cayard's timing was perfect, and he slashed inside of Prada. The Italians screamed foul _ America One had left no room to spare _ but the umpires judged that it was a clean maneuver. The Americans slipped behind the committee boat with Prada just astern to take the start by seven seconds. \n",
      " It was a perfect start. The Italians' view of the Americans' stern would not change for the remainder of the contest. \n",
      " \"What we realized in this series is we haven't quite had the zip we had in the semifinals,\" Cayard said after the victory. \"We've just been trying to get it back in the groove. \n",
      " \"Certainly in the afterguard on America One with that kind of start, and those shifts that John picked for us on the first beat, that kind of a lead at the top mark is awesome, so that was good,\" he added, referring to America One's tactician, John Kostecki. \n",
      " The Americans sailed a brilliant first leg, hitting each shift as the southwest wind puffed up to 21 knots and eventually opening up a seven-boat-length advantage. America One's lead at the top mark was 32 seconds. \n",
      " Prada was conceding nothing at all. Both boats hoisted conventional spinnakers as the breeze began to fluctuate, bellowing up and down from 15 to 19 knots. Now it was the Italians' turn to hit a crucial shift or two. \n",
      " Showing good pace off the wind, and finding the better pressure pulsing down the whitecap-flecked Hauraki Gulf, Prada began to reel back major chunks of waterborne real estate, rounding the bottom mark a mere 10 seconds behind America One. \n",
      " Prada immediately tacked to the right, and Cayard had no choice but to follow to defend his lead. He could not risk having the Italians find better wind or a favorable shift. \n",
      " The Italians seemed to be sailing a hair closer to the wind, an advantage Cayard noticed. \n",
      " \"We're a little down for some reason,\" he said. But Kostecki was on top of his game and ultimately forced Prada past the layline for the windward mark _adding a short but critical extra margin to the distance Prada would have to sail. \n",
      " Squeezing around the mark, America One held an 18-second lead with half of the 18.5-mile-long course behind it. \n",
      " But a pattern was emerging. If America One showed a bit more speed upwind, it was all Prada when the boats creamed downwind under spinnaker. \n",
      " Then the Italians picked an extremely bad moment to make a mistake. \n",
      " It was a beauty. \n",
      " In the midst of their own jibe, with the pressure from the fresh puff too much for their overtrimmed sails, the Italians broached and skidded out of control. When their spinnaker collapsed and sailed skyward in the midst of the sensational wipeout, America One pulled away. \n",
      " Cayard and his crew did nothing dramatic, holding to conservative tactics to record their second crucial victory by a final margin of 34 seconds.: [9751, 9734, 7842]\n",

      "If Whitney wants to drive by herself when she turns 16 in September, that's the way it has to be. \n",
      " Effective July 1, Kansas law requires that 16- and 17-year-olds have at least 50 hours of adult-supervised driving experience to qualify for an unrestricted license. \n",
      " \"Pretty much anywhere we go, she drives,\" said Julie Trigg, Whitney's mother. \"I think the 50 hours is a terrific idea.\" \n",
      " A parent or guardian must sign an affidavit certifying that the 50 hours have been completed. At least 10 of the 50 hours must be at night. Time spent behind the wheel in driver education classes counts toward the 50 hours. \n",
      " The bill passed during this year's legislative session and was signed by Gov. Bill Graves, putting Kansas in company with 33 other states that have graduated driver's license laws, according to the AAA Automobile Club of Kansas. \n",
      " Teen-age drivers in Kansas are eligible for instructional or farm permits at age 14, restricted licenses at 15 and unrestricted licenses at 16, provided requirements are met. \n",
      " In another new facet of Kansas law, any person younger than 16 with a restricted license who is convicted of two or more moving violations will remain restricted until age 17. \n",
      " Drivers with farm permits or restricted licenses may not transport nonsibling minor passengers unless accompanied by a parent. Doing so will be considered a moving violation. \n",
      " \"If we can stress this point, we hope it will curb the careless driving you sometimes see in young people,\" said Sgt. John Eichkorn of the Kansas Highway Patrol. \n",
      " Missouri is one of three states that have graduated driver's license bills awaiting governors' signatures to become law. Chris Sifford, chief of staff for Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan, said the governor is still reviewing the bill and has not decided whether he will sign it. \n",
      " The proposal would raise the age for an unrestricted license to 18 but would allow 16- and 17-year-olds who have met requirements to drive alone, except from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., when a parent or guardian would have to be present. \n",
      " The rationale behind the graduated driver's license laws is safety. In Kentucky, which was among the first states to adopt a graduated driver's license law in 1995, vehicle fatalities among 16-year-olds have dropped 88 percent, said Lori Haskett of AAA Kansas. \n",
      " In Kansas, teen-agers made up just 8.5 percent of drivers in 1997, but were involved in 14.3 percent of wrecks, according to state Department of Transportation statistics. \n",
      " Some in Kansas, including AAA, wanted to see the minimum age for an unrestricted license go up to 17. However, opposition from rural areas and some urban areas kept such a proposal from advancing in the Legislature. \n",
      " \"I think it's a good compromise,\" said state Rep. John Ballou of Gardner, vice chairman of the House Transportation Committee. \"It still allows them to get a license (at age 16), but most importantly to get some experience before they're out on their own.\" \n",
      " Many parents who have provided chauffeur service for years appreciate the convenience of their children being able to drive to and from school. \n",
      " Ballou acknowledges that some parents will fudge on the 50-hour requirement, but still believes that any additional time behind the wheel will help young drivers. \n",

      "They call them the \"mothers of the forest,\"the tall, distinctively white-barked trees with round leaves like little sails that tremble in the slightest breeze. \n",
      " Groves of quaking aspens attract thousands of tourists to the San Francisco Peaks area in the late summer and early fall as their leaves turn from green to iridescent gold before fluttering to the forest floor. \n",
      " A beautiful sight, acknowledges Jim Rolf, an aspen expert and ranger for the Coconino National Forest. \n",
      " But, he warns, \"enjoy them while you can.\" \n",
      " Aspens are disappearing at an alarming rate from the forests of Arizona and New Mexico. \n",
      " A Forest Service study earlier this decade said the number of acres of aspens in the two states had declined to 263,000 in 1986 from 486,000 in 1962. \n",
      " Another study about the shrinking numbers of aspens is due out next year, said Marlin Johnson, assistant regional director for forestry in Albuquerque. Initial estimates indicate that the number of acres has fallen to 200,000. \n",
      " The glorious aspen is being attacked on many fronts, Johnson and Rolf say. \n",
      " Thick, expansive stands of conifers, particularly ponderosa pines, are crowding aspens into ever-smaller groves, the young pines using the shade of the aspens as a growth supplement. \n",
      " The once-destructive wildfires in the Southwest, which opened large blocks of land and aided aspen regeneration by heating the soil, are regularly put out after burning fewer and fewer acres. \n",
      " Even the idea of thinning the numerous thickets in the pine forests to spur more aspen growth hasn't materialized. Many of the prime aspen groves are in areas where the federally protected Mexican spotted owl needs the thick conifer canopy. \n",
      " Those aspen saplings that do break through the forest floor are being nibbled to the ground by large herds of elk and deer, which, Rolf said, consider the aspen areas as \"a daily trip to the salad bar.\" \n",
      " And, even though winds can blow aspen seeds as far as a half-mile away, they seldom take root in the Southwestern forests because of the need for open space and constant moisture. \n",
      " Rolf has a daily reminder of the problems around Flagstaff. \n",
      " High on the wall of his office at the Peaks Ranger Station north of Flagstaff is a grainy, 1910 photo of Hart Prairie, the most popular area near the peaks for those wanting to see the fall change of colors. \n",
      " In that photo, two large groves of aspens are divided by a meadow with high grass. \n",
      " Below that is a photo of the same site 75 years later. It's now a pure thicket of ponderosa pine trees. \n",
      " \"Sixty percent of our acreage once dominated by aspen is now dominated by pine and Doug(las) fir,\" Rolf said. \"If this trend is allowed to continue for the next 50 to 75 years, the remaining aspens are going to be too old to regenerate.\" \n",
      " The Coconino Forest has been doing what it can, with limited resources, to try to retain its most prized aspen groves. \n",
      " Workers have constructed 20 miles of fence, 7 feet high and at $6,000 per mile, around more than 400 acres of aspen in the Flagstaff area, designed to keep big game away.In the Apache-Sitgreaves forests of eastern Arizona, only about 100 acres of aspens are fenced. \n",
      " Rolf said that Coconino Forest rangers also have coated metal strips with peanut butter, hooked up to electric fences, in an attempt to shock elk and keep them from coming to the areas. \n",
      " For the most part, this limited aspen restoration effort has worked. \n",
      " Rolf takes particular pride in a 24-acre plot near U.S. 180 northwest of Flagstaff called the Malpai enhancement area. \n",
      " After being fenced in 1994, Rolf said, all the pines were cut in the area and a controlled burn was conducted to make the soil ripe for aspen restoration. In the first year after that, 2,000 aspen saplings sprouted and grew up to 5 feet. \n",
      " Now, it's a virtual jungle of 10-foot aspens and tall grasses. \n",
      " Rolf contrasts that with the heavily grazed aspen saplings on the other side of the fence, which are seldom more than an inch tall. Eventually, however, the fences will have to be removed. \n",
      " \"The sad part is that more than half of the protected aspen areas in the Southwest are in that one district near Flagstaff,\" said Johnson, the assistant regional forester. \"The cost of the fencing and labor is prohibitive. Meanwhile, we have a crisis because more than three-quarters of our groves are 75 to 80 years old and nearing the end of their life cycle.\" \n",
      " Rolf and Johnson said it takes an aspen about seven years to grow large enough to fend off big game. \n",
      " Tom Britt, regional manager for the state Game and Fish Department in Flagstaff, said about 3,000 elk roam in the area of the peaks, down 25 percent from their apex in the early 1990s. But Britt said more hunting permits are being offered, in part because of concerns about the aspens. \n",
      " \"There's been hardly any aspen regeneration for 50 years now,\" Britt said. \"In addition to the elk, the groves attract everything that eats vegetative materials. They gather there like humans do on a sidewalk if you scattered hundred-dollar bills.\" \n",
      " The decline of aspens is much more than just an aesthetic concern, said Cathy Dahms, who asseses the biological health of the Southwest's forests for the U.S. Forest Service in Albuquerque. \n",
      " \"Over 200 wildlife species use aspens, ranging from the bark being nutrition for rabbits in the winter to the decaying cavities being great nesting areas for birds,\" Dahms said. \"We have a very serious problem on our hands.\" \n",
      " There has been one major aspen success story in the state, however. The 11,000-foot Escudilla Mountain, north of the community of Alpine, is covered with the trees. \n",
      " \"We just had some good luck there,\" said Doug Beal, a Forest Service tree specialist in Springerville. \"We had a fire which cleared the mountain in the early 1950s, and the big-game populations were small then.\" \n",
      " Bonnie Holmes, a Flagstaff author who recently wrote a book about aspens, blames the decline of the tree entirely on humans. After all, she said, bureaucrats make decisions to suppress forest fires and regulate game numbers. \n",
      " \"We changed all the rules that allowed aspens to thrive,\" Holmes said. \"They are the mothers of the forest but are also so delicate at the same time. And now, they are suffering mightily in the woods.\" Mark Shaffer can be reached at (602) 444-8057 or at mark.shaffer(at)pni.com.: [9871, 9856, 8338]\n",

More than a dozen court officers were on hand to control the crowd, and several of the defendants' supporters said the youths were being unfairly labeled as racists. \n",

And Kevin Teague, a United Parcel Service employee who was the victim of the attack, asked the judge to give the defendants the maximum sentence. \n",

      " Tom Lasorda: Why not? The guy's been around baseball almost since it was invented, and there is never a dull moment with him in the vicinity. He says he doesn't want it, but I don't believe him. He'd need an assistant to dot the i's and cross the t's in player contracts, but he still has plenty of energy even though he's getting as old as Zsa Zsa. Who better to serve as Lasorda's manservant than Bill Russell? \n",
      " Monica Lewinsky: The Fox people claim to want more flash and dash with the Dodgers, and they'd definitely get it if Monica winds up in the GM booth. She has a proven record of being loyal to her boss. Her tabloid-shadowed presence definitely would result in the Dodgers receiving extensive media coverage, but, alas, it might cause a rebellion among the Dodgers players' wives. \n",
      " Fred Claire: Might be General Manager of the Century for the work he did during his 10 year incumbency under the terrible fiscal restraints of Peter O'Malley. Oh sure, he blew it with the Pedro Martinez for Delino DeShields trade, but Lasorda never should have pitched to Jack Clark, either. We all make mistakes. I once rejected Arnold Schwarzenegger's impassioned pleas to do a book with him, and there went my chance forever at a villa on the French Riviera. At least Claire didn't give his imprimatur to that embarrassing mid-season Dodger trade in which, among other live bodies, they got rid of Mike Piazza and acquired Bobby Bonilla, who some insist isn't alive on those rare occasions he puts on a baseball uniform. \n",
      " Todd Donoho: Nice guy who needs a job. Liked by everybody. Showed for almost 10 years at KABC that talent and knowledge are irrelevant to becoming a successful sportscaster. I'm willing to bet that Todd can prove talent and knowledge are also irrelevant in becoming a successful GM, or I'll take a hike. \n",
      " Bob Graziano: Doesn't Graziano know that Rupert Murdoch's behind-the-scenes Dodger emissaries, Peter Chernin and Chase Carey, are eventually going to oust him, too? Why not beat them to the punch like Rocky Graziano would have done? Why not apply for another, less important job in the organization? Graziano would have made it big in one of those old tinhorn dictator regimes in the 1950s in South America. He's one of those blessed guys able to survive while everyone around him is being purged. \n",
      " Bobby Bonilla: Since he's not doing anything on the field to earn the millions of dollars the Dodgers are paying him, Bonilla should be propped up off it to at least give the impression he can do something other than bilk big-time corporations out of their money. He could hire the Lakers' Elden Campbell as his assistant. \n",
      " Joe McDonnell: This sterling media trailblazer would be the perfect GM/propagandist for the Dodgers. If, by some quirk of random fate he failed to put together a winning team and this is a man by his own humble admission has never made a lousy trade during 20 years of passionate Dodger advocacy on the radio it won't matter. Ol' Joe will simply gulp the Bill Clinton Truth Serum he carries with him at all times and will blithely go on the air and insist everything is sailing along well with the team. Filibustering fantasy and frivolous fables have become standard material on McDonnell's afternoon drive-time wonderland romp. \n",
      " Peter O'Malley: OK, laugh. Now, have you stopped? Not yet? I'll give you a few more hours. Now ready? Now ready? I think Bottom Line Pete would be a splendid GM because someone else's money would now be at stake instead of his own. And, anyway, what else does O'Malley have to do except count all his money and be grateful everyday of his life that Somebody Up There saw to it that he was born the son of Walter O'Malley. \n"

      "Reeling from their fifth straight season without making the NHL playoffs, the Islanders named Butch Goring as their new head coach Friday and dismissed Bill Stewart. \n",
      " Goring, 49, who was an integral member of the Islanders teams that won four consecutive Stanley Cups in the early 1980s, became the team's sixth head coach in five seasons, getting the job only two days after he was contacted by Mike Milbury, the Islanders' general manager. Greg Cronin and Lorne Henning will remain as assistants to Goring. \n",
      " \"It's like a dream come true,\" Goring said at Friday's news conference. \"I can't say that a day has passed that I haven't wanted to step into Al Arbour's shoes. I'm going to coach this team the way I played.\" \n",
      " After Goring's playing career ended in Boston in 1985, he was named the Bruins' head coach and led the team to the playoffs for the 1985-86 season before spending the next 13 seasons coaching in the minor leagues. Most recently he was the coach and general manager of the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League, a former Islanders farm club. He was twice named the IHL's coach of the year, both times after guiding the Grizzlies to championships in 1995 and 1996. \n",
      " After Milbury called Goring on Wednesday, Goring immediately flew from Edmonton, Alberta, where he had been scouting the NHL playoffs, to New York for an interview. Within 30 minutes on Thursday, Milbury said, he and Goring had agreed on a three-year contract worth about $1.5 million. Milbury had played for Goring briefly in Boston and has worked closely with him in cultivating the Islanders' minor league talent for the past four seasons. Goring had declined an assistant's job with the Islanders last summer. \n",
      " \"Over the last couple of years we've had trouble getting some stability,\" Milbury said. \"This should solve that problem. We're glad to have him back. \n",
      " \"Butch is the right person for a lot of reasons,\" Milbury added. \"He has been a champion as both a player and a coach. He is an excellent communicator who knows how to develop young players. And just as important, Butch has Islander blood.\" \n",
      " The hiring of Goring was not the only shake-up in the Islanders' front office Friday. The team also named John Sanders as team president. He replaces David Seldin, who had not been associated with the team since January. Bob Brennfleck was named as senior vice president for hockey operations. \n",
      " Goring, who was considered the final piece of the Islanders' championship teams when he was acquired from the Kings at the trade deadline on March 10, 1980, was a gritty center with soft hands. He was not the most talented player on the ice, but he had a tremendous work ethic. That work ethic is what Goring said he will expect from his players. \n",
      " \"To play for me, you have to play at both ends of the ice,\" Goring said. \"Everybody can back-check.\" \n",
      " Friday's announcement formally ended Stewart's brief coaching stint with the Islanders, but his future with the team had been in doubt for weeks. He was promoted from assistant to head coach on Jan. 21 to replace Milbury, who had resigned to focus on his managerial duties. \n",
      " Stewart was 11-19-7 with an undertalented team, but he might have doomed any chance he had of remaining as coach when, after a loss to the Rangers on March 29, he questioned his team's talent and management's commitment to winning. \n",
      " During a conference call this morning, Stewart said that he did not believe the disparaging comments factored into his dismissal. \n",
      " \"I just think it's an amicable parting, and we decided to explore other options,\" said Stewart, who hopes to get another head coaching job in the NHL. \"There's no surprise; it was done earlier this week. It's a difficult situation, we all know that. I want to explore my opportunities as the Islanders did also.\" \n",
      " Goring faces a difficult challenge. He takes over a team that was stripped down at the trading deadline and could lose more important players by September. \n",
      " \"There have been some problems here in the past,\" Goring said. \"I'm trying to be part of the solution.\": [10541, 10530, 8872]\n",

      " Lenihan retired in 1995 as an associate professor of sociology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He had joined the faculty in 1980, after earlier stints as a researcher at Columbia University's Bureau of Applied Social Research, the Vera Institute of Justice in New York and the Bureau of Social Science Research in Washington. \n",

      "In an effort to cut costs, the parent of Fidelity Federal Bank said Monday that it has completed a management shake-up that will save it $1.7 million annually. \n",
      " As part of the changes, Bank Plus Corp. said it will promote three executives and not fill the posts they are vacating. The moves were prompted by a third-quarter, $60 million loss in the company's credit card division, a loss that prompted the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision to change its rating of the firm to \"adequately capitalized,\" from its previous \"well-capitalized\" classification. The lower rating makes Bank Plus subject to more government scrutiny. \n",
      " Moving up the corporate ladder in the reshuffling is John Michel, the company's director of strategic planning who will now become chief financial officer. Also promoted were general counsel Godfrey Evans, who will now serve as chief administrative officer, and Richard Villa, the firm's controller who becomes Bank Plus' treasurer. All appointments are subject to approval by the Office of Thrift Administration. \n",

      "As they opened their four-day festival of benevolence in Philadelphia, Republicans of all stripes seemed convinced that Gov. George W. Bush's election was a sure thing in November. Yet the best possible reminder of the perils of optimism lay only a couple miles west of the First Union Center at an abandoned convention hall on the other side of the Schuylkill River. \n",
      " It was there in Philadelphia's massive old Municipal Auditorium that Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York captured the 1948 Republican presidential nomination, with similarly high expectations. Indeed, Meyer Berger reported in The New York Times that the delegates were attending \"the richest, the noisiest, the most exuberant quadrennial Republican meeting\" since losing the White House to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. \n",
      " By contrast, a month later in the same auditorium, President Harry Truman was given the Democratic nomination at a convention that Berger likened to a wake. The stifling heat did more than wilt emotions. When some \"doves of peace\" hidden inside a flowered liberty bell were released to signal Truman's arrival, several turned out to have died, while others menaced the delegates as Chairman Sam Rayburn shouted over the radio, \"Get those (expletive) pigeons out of here!\" It was considered just another bad omen for the party. \n",
      " For 52 years, of course, every underdog presidential candidate has compared himself to Truman, who defied expectations and won in November. But since 1948 was the last time Philadelphia played host to a national convention _ indeed three national conventions, including that of the Progressive Party of Henry Wallace _ echoes from that year seem particularly acute this year. \n",
      " According to a new book, \"The Last Campaign: How Harry Truman Won the 1948 Election,\" Philadelphia was chosen as the convention site because it sat in the center of a coaxial transmission belt enabling television to be transmitted to 500,000 sets from Richmond to Boston. In all, writes the author Zachary Karabell, 10 million viewers watched the conventions in the new medium. Democrats learned from mistakes by the Republicans and shortened their proceedings for viewers, launching a trend culminating in both parties tailoring their entire conventions for an audience that still may reach 100 million this year. \n",
      " The substance also reflects how much, and how little, has changed in 52 years. Dewey's capture of the Republican nomination came at the height of the hegemony of the party's so-called liberal Eastern establishment. By the 1960s, control of the party shifted south, along with the Bush family. George Bush moved to Texas out of the shadow of his father, Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut, but he was always seen as a son of that establishment. Now Governor Bush, like his father, proclaims himself a man of the Sunbelt, but acts like an internationalist in the Dewey-Eisenhower tradition. \n",
      " Despite the pigeon problem, Truman went on to give a great acceptance speech in Philadelphia that launched his historic come-from-behind victory. What is striking about it is how little the issues have changed. Truman outlined them as Social Security, education, health, the minimum wage and avoiding tax cuts for the rich in order to pay down the national debt. \n",
      " The Truman style will be hard to replicate, however. Like Vice President Al Gore in this year's campaign, Truman bragged endlessly on how prosperous farmers and workers had become under the Democrats. But somehow it is hard to imagine Gore issuing Truman's salty warning to both that \"they are the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the Democratic Party by this year.\" \n",
      " At the end of their sweltering convention, drenched and wilted Republicans left town convinced they had a winner but feeling somehow uninspired. Dewey, said the Nation magazine, was \"the nominee nobody loves.\" This year, judging from the reaction of delegates in Philadelphia, that is one thing that is strikingly different. But of course Governor Bush is beloved most of all because he looks like a sure winner. From the delegates' perspective, the presumptive nominee's strategy of staging a streamlined convention with plenty of uplifting talk and pictures of a more diverse Republican Party looks like a winner, too. \n"

      " But in the padlocked auditorium across the river, there may be a few ghosts who remember the lesson of 1948.

      " \"We talked along those same lines,\" Smith said, \"with compensation increasing as the team won playoff rounds. But I don't think the deal we talked about was a good deal for us.

      " \"Comfortable?,\" Tim Wallach said with a bemused expression. \"Did it look like we were comfortable?\" \n",

      " \"Wins are wins,\" said Wallach, obtained for just such wisdom. \"Certainly you'd like to have an easier win after it's 11-0. But right now it doesn't matter.\" \n",
      " There's something to that. The second-place Dodgers gained a game on the San Diego Padres, who lead the National League West by a game, for the first time in eight days. The Dodgers have won 15 of their past 20, and in that time gained only 1{ games on the Padres, who lost 4-2 to the Montreal Expos. \n",

      " It's not just Valdes, of course. The entire pitching staff has allowed 63 runs in its past 13 games, an average of nearly five per outing, though that wobble has been spotted by an offense that is suddenly sound. \n",
      " \"You'd think with 11 runs you'd coast in,\" Russell said. \"Maybe that was the problem. \n",

      " \"When I hear the kids talking about getting out of here, they don't talk about being doctors or lawyers or senators _ they talk about basketball players or they talk about being Bobby Brown,\" says Lettye Rice, a resident of Boston's Orchard Park section whose 12-year-old son Marcus is one of Brown's worshipers. \"They sing a little or rap or dance and think somebody's gonna find them and make them famous. And they think that once they're famous, it doesn't matter how crazy they act.\" \n",
      " Jamal Hood, 15, who claims to have known the singer \"since he was just another one of me,\" bristles when Brown's effectiveness as a role model is questioned. \"Bobby Brown came from the streets, and he never forgot that, no matter how famous he got. Everybody in Orchard Park was proud of him. He was always real people, real down, and we knew that any one of us could do what he did.\" \n",
      " Let's see, which stellar behavior would we have our impressionable young ones emulate? Kicking a Hollywood security guard in the back? Rearranging the features of a nightclub patron in Orlando? Simulating the sex act on stage before an underage audience? \n",
      " Granted, it wasn't Bobby Brown blasting away in the wee hours of Thursday morning when his friend and prospective brother-in-law Steven (Shot) Sealey went down in a barrage of bullets outside the Biarritz Lounge in Roxbury. And Brown was obviously not the killer's intended target. Although trouble follows the singer as sure as Monday follows Sunday, this time it seems he was just hanging out, stomping the home turf, hoisting a few with old friends, desperately trying to squeeze an extra couple of seconds out of his waning 15 minutes of fame. \n",
      " But the (why do I want to say \"former\"?) pop singer was inextricably linked to the whole seamy scene, hurling expletives and punching walls and sporting the sweet clinging stench of the famous who have fallen. Sealey _ who, mind you, had a rap sheet longer than this year's drought and was no paragon of virtue _ was sitting in the front seat of Brown's car when the bullets hit and he slumped forward, leaving smears of blood on the Bentley's gleaming dashboard. And although it was Sealey who breathed his last, Brown was the sweetheart of the late-night camera eye as celebrity stalkers were treated to blurred shots of him leaving the scene, scrambling for the warmth of a Benz. \n",
      " \"It was cool that he was there, beside his boy when everything went down, just like a regular brother,\" says Jamal. \"Hey, he's Bobby Brown. He didn't have to be there.\" \n",
      " And he probably wishes he weren't. Of course, Brown's plummet from grace is typical. But in a neighborhood where the names Colin Powell and Al Gore and Maya Angelou draw blank stares from a group of school-age kids and school is simply a hindrance between the basketball court and the record store, we don't need his kind of hero. No one who parks a Bentley on a street in a desolate neighborhood is returning to inspire, to encourage, to mentor. He is asking those he left behind to bask in all that is shallow, to believe that a boy can leave Orchard Park projects, learn absolutely nothing at all, and still return a conquering _ if financially and morally squashed _ hero. And the kids, needing to believe in the quick fix, see the outward trappings and believe that they signal some inner strength. \n",
      " Brown's antics _ oh, did I tell you he carved four-letter greetings into the seat of the police cruiser before dousing it with his steamy offering? _ have finally cost him the seemingly mindless devotion of she-who-sneezes-dimes, his elegant trophy, songstress wife Whitney Houston. The odd couple is officially \"estranged.\" And Brown, who reportedly can't pay his bills now that the financial pipeline known as Whitney has clamped shut, is entertaining the notion of returning to the Roxbury neighborhood and opening a store in the ol' 'hood. \n",
      " Perhaps he'll sell cream-colored Bentleys. Or hefty slices of humble pie. Or snapshots of his life to the kids in Orchard Park who, inexplicably, still want to be him.: [15230, 15221, 12453]\n",

      " Walking forward, he then pulled a handgun from his belt and held it at arm's length, firing round after round at three police officers crouched behind cars across the street. \n",
      " The officers returned fire, and the suspect dropped. \n",
      " The surviving suspect's behavior seemed to grow erratic as his car, the left rear tire blown out, labored up the street. At one point, he got out of his car, transferred weapons, then got back in. \n",
      " Looking for another car to help his escape, the gunman tried to ram two approaching cars before shooting into the windshield of an approaching pickup truck, which brought the vehicle to a stop and sent its driver running for his life. \n",
      " Shortly before 10 a.m., a squad car zoomed to the area, and two officers clad in riot gear and carrying automatic weapons engaged the suspect in a vicious fire fight. \n",
      " Dozens of shots were fired, ripping into the cars and crashing through their windows. Finally, the gunman raised his hand in apparent surrender and police closed in. \n",
      " After nearly one hour, after more than an estimated thousands of rounds of ammunition had been sprayed in the neighborhood, after 15 people were injured, Special Weapons and Tactics officers swarmed the fatally wounded suspect, leaving him handcuffed and face down on the street where he died. \n"

      " The Rangers were in an emotional funk, having lost their starting goaltender, Mike Richter, who suffered a severely pulled groin muscle Saturday night in Edmonton. They were playing their third game in four nights, all on the road, at the end of a month in which they played 17 games, a record for the team. \n",
      " The Rangers were continually outraced to loose pucks, often left the Flames alone for shots in the slot and were frustrated by the Flames' aggressive forechecking. \n",
      " But they kept the game close until Theoren Fleury ripped a 30-foot slap shot past Rangers goalie Glenn Healy with 5 minutes 4 seconds remaining in the game to go up by 3-1. Fleury received a pass at the left circle, wound up and beat Healy cleanly to the glove side. \n",
      " The Rangers finished 2-1 on this trip and 11-3-3 for the month and head home with a record of 25-11-6 this season. But they also return to Madison Square Garden for Wednesday's game against Montreal with questions surrounding them because of the condition of Richter. \n",
      " \"We played with some emotion but not enough,\" Rangers Coach Colin Campbell said. \"I think some of our guys thought, `We've got four points on this trip, let's get out of Dodge.' We're counting on the same people night in, night out. We need some other guys to step up.\" \n",
      " There were periods of inspired play by the Rangers Sunday night. Mark Messier, hustling up and down the ice all night, batted in a rebound for the Rangers' first goal, threw hard checks and tried to stir his teammates early in the third period, when he smacked Zarley Zalapski with a right while jostling behind the net. \n",
      " And Healy proved a formidable line of last defense. He stopped 23 of the Flames' first 25 shots, several times on clear shots from the slot. \n",
      " The Flames, taking advantage of the Rangers' lethargy and their continued propensity to take penalties, jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the first period on a pair of goals by forward Michael Nylander. \n",
      " Nylander scored first when he got loose in front of the Ranger net and smacked Cory Stillman's centering pass past Healy just 2:43 into the game. \n",
      " The Rangers have been stressing the need to refrain from taking penalties, and that seemed paramount Sunday night without Richter and the defenseman Mattias Norstrom, who separated his right shoulder Saturday night in Edmonton. \n",
      " But the Rangers were slapped with a pair of penalties just 17 seconds apart with six minutes remaining in the first period. Nick Kypreos was called for slashing, and then Kevin Lowe brought down German Titov with an open-field tackle that would have made Mary Levy proud. Lowe went off for holding, and the Flames scored on the subsequent 5-on-3 advantage to go up by 2-1. \n",
      " Fleury, the Flames' spark plug, dug the puck out of the right corner, skated behind the Rangers' net and centered the puck to Titov. His shot from 12 feet out was blocked by Healy, but the rebound caromed to Nylander, who was alone at the side of the net for an easy score. \n",
      " (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) \n",
      " Healy could not be faulted for either goal, and he made several crucial stops in the first two periods. The Flames got loose repeatedly in the slot. Healy robbed Dean Evason with only 15 seconds remaining in the first period and made a pair of glove saves, on Titov and Fleury, in the waning minutes of the second period. \n",
      " Messier pulled the Rangers within 2-1 when he battled the puck past Calgary goalie Trevor Kidd after a centering pass from Pat Verbeek. \n",

      "Responding to objections from New Jersey Transit, the Federal Railroad Administration on Thursday relaxed a new rule instituted in the wake of two collisions last month, including the one in Secaucus, N.J. \n",
      " The rule was part of an emergency order issued Feb. 20, and set new guidelines on what engineers must do if they stop or slow to less than 10 miles an hour after passing a signal. Under the emergency order, the engineers must then proceed with caution and be prepared to stop, which generally means 30 miles per hour or slower, until they come to the next signal. \n",
      " New Jersey Transit said that applying the rule to all signals would create widespread delays; the amended rule will apply to only about 40 percent of the signals nationwide. \n",
      " The rule was instituted after the crashes in Secaucus and another one in Silver Spring, Md. In the Maryland crash, the engineer saw a signal and then stopped at a station. From there, he proceeded as if the signal had been clear, although investigators believe it was actually ordering a 30-mile-per-hour speed. The investigators think he forgot. \n",
      " The commuter train accelerated to 63 miles an hour before the engineer spotted an Amtrak train on the tracks ahead of him; he slowed to 40 before the head-on collision. Eleven people, including the crew of three, were killed. \n",
      " Under the revision, the go-slow rule will apply only to signals that precede \"interlockings,\" or places where trains cross from one set of tracks to another. That means it will apply to only about 40 percent as many signals as previously anticipated, according to Grady C. Cothen, the deputy associate administrator for safety standards. \n",
      " Cothen said the interlockings were where head-on collisions occur. \n",
      " The revised order also requires that within 30 days the railroads must mark the signals to which it applies. \n",
      " The rule does not apply to systems that have automatic train control, which stops trains that violate signals, or trains with cab signals, which sound an alarm in such cases. \n",
      " Some railroads already followed the procedure that will now be mandatory. The speed at which an engineer could proceed after stopping or slowing down to 10 miles per hour depended on the stretch of track, but in another change, the agency said tonight that it could be no faster than 40 miles per hour. \n",
      " The agency also clarified another part of its order, regarding testing of emergency window exits. Some railroads complained that under the original rule, if they found a single defective window, they would have to test every other window in the fleet. Now, they will have to sample the other windows, using a statistical method that gives them 95 percent confidence that all the windows are safe.: [17386, 17378, 13742]\n",

      "The rich stands of cottonwood and willow along Cave Creek are on the way to being preserved. So are the foothills of the Superstition Mountains. \n",
      " Arizona Gov. Fife Symington signed a law Wednesday that extends the reach of the Arizona Preserve Initiative to some of the Valley's most valuable wildlife habitat. \n",
      " But through a technical glitch, Pima County was mostly dealt out of the expanded Preserve Initiative. \n",
      " \"We were disappointed,\" said Pima County parks analyst Steve Anderson. \"We expected, as the second most populous county in the state, to be included.\" \n",
      " Symington chose Cave Creek, one of the few year-round sources of water in Maricopa County, as a dramatic backdrop for signing the bill. \n",
      " The new law opens the door for the Desert Foothills Land Trust to preserve 25 acres around the creek. With its thicket of trees and bushes, the creek is a startling sight in the desert and attracts a picture book of desert wildlife, from Gila monsters and javelinas to coyotes and bobcats. \n",
      " \"This is a wonderful step for us,\" said Patricia Ann Seitts, Desert Foothills executive director. \n",
      " Lawmakers had wrangled up to the last hours of the session over whether to expand the Preserve Initiative, with Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain urging approval. \n",
      " The law sets up a way to conserve state trust land, which was set aside at statehood to benefit education and other public institutions, by buying or leasing it. \n",
      " But it was limited to trust land within three miles of large cities and one mile of towns with populations of 10,000 or less. \n",
      " That left Cave Creek a tantalizing one-tenth mile out of reach for those who wanted to preserve it. \n",
      " The new law allows land to be preserved for an extra 10 miles under certain conditions. It also specifically includes areas around the Superstition and Tortolita mountains. \n",
      " Rural lawmakers resisted other exceptions, such as state trust land around Prescott and Flagstaff. \n",
      " They also limited the 10-mile extension to counties with a population of 700,000 or more. \n",
      " Besides giant Maricopa County, that should cover Pima County, with its estimated 752,000 people. But somehow, standard language was added to the bill, specifying the population under the 1990 census _ when Pima County had 667,000 people. \n",
      " \"Nobody noticed until the very, very last day, and it was too late to do anything,\" said Arlan Colton of the State Land Department. \"That's a little bit frustrating because it was nobody's intention.\" \n",
      " \"We think it's a mistake,\" Anderson agreed. \n",
      " Until the next census or a change in the law, Anderson said, it will be impossible for Pima County to take any steps to acquire trust land in the Rincon Valley, which would have been part of the 780-mile Arizona Trail from Utah to Mexico. \n",
      " However, Anderson is pleased that trust land in the Tortolita Mountains, in the north part of Pima County and lapping into Pinal County, is eligible for preservation. On May 20, voters will decide in a bond election whether to put $7.1 million into acquiring land and building trails in the Tortolitas. \n",
      " To the State Land Department, which oversees trust land, the expanded Preserve Initiative is \"another management tool, and we look forward to using it,\" Colton said. \n",
      " The law sets out a complex process. The land must be classified as worth preserving, appraised and then put up for auction. Existing leases cannot be canceled. \n",
      " Money is the biggest hurdle. \n",
      " For the Cave Creek area, the Desert Foothills group landed a $100,000 grant from a Washington state group and has raised $118,000 in matching funds. \n",
      " \"We may have to come up with more funds, but it's a darned good start,\" said Chuck Bune, president of the group. \n",
      " To save land around the Superstitions, \"we have to raise millions and millions of dollars,\" said Anne Coe, a founder of the Superstition Area Land Trust. \n"

      " \"I think they (African-American panelists) follow orders better,\" said Simpson attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr., noting that more white jury prospects have been removed for watching television, reading newspapers or talking about the case. \n",
      " University of Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said that the numbers of potential African-American jurors will help Simpson, who is African-American, particularly as the defense tries to discredit the Los Angeles Police Department's investigation during the course of the trial. \n",
      " \"All of the opinion polls have shown that blacks are much more likely than whites to believe O.J. Simpson is innocent,\" Chemerinsky said. \"And because of the history of racism in law enforcement, blacks are more likely to be suspicious of police than whites. Since the core of the defense strategy seems to be to put the police on trial, having a substantial African-American representation on the jury can help the defense.\" \n",
      " The first phase of jury selection is expected to end this morning when attorneys resume questioning a 27-year-old African-American woman from the Los Angeles-area city of Monterey Park. If she is kept on the panel, it will only add to the number of African-Americans eligible to serve on the high-profile case. \n",

      " \"It's going to mean that down the road, the prosecution is going to be facing a dilemma if part of their goal is to remove African-American jurors,\" Saxon said. \n",

      "Here's another shocking revelation on how badly Cal State Northridge administrators have misjudged the real public outrage from their decision to kill baseball and men's volleyball from the athletic program: \n",
      " On Friday, in front of some 30 bemused spectators, Northridge assistant football coach John Rosenberg was asked to speak at a meeting of the University Budget Advisory Board. He was introduced by school president Blenda Wilson. \n",
      " Rosenberg is a member of the school's Intercollegiate Athletic Advisory Board, the same board that athletic director Paul Bubb and vice president Ronald Kopita repeatedly refer to when asked if they consulted with the public. \n",
      " Rosenberg stood up with a straight face and gave his opinion on why so many letters, e-mails, faxes and phone calls have been received by university personnel and local newspapers. \n",
      " \"I wonder whether the media created it,\" he said of the continuing outcry. \n",
      " It's no wonder Northridge has a credibility problem when out-of-touch people like Rosenberg are consulted on whether the Valley community would support the killing of baseball and volleyball from the athletic program. \n",
      " Rosenberg is still a member of the Athletic Advisory Board, which should leave many feeling uncomfortable about Northridge's future. Why would anyone trust administrators to competently run the athletic program when some of their own advisory board members are clueless? \n",
      " At this same meeting, Bubb revealed that athletic department travel expenses for last year were $170,000 greater than anticipated. Did the basketball team fly the Concorde to Bozeman, Mt.? Did the golf team make a road trip to Augusta, Ga.? \n",
      " The school claims because it was the first year of playing in the Big Sky Conference, travel costs could not be properly estimated. Forgive me, but going over budget by $170,000 on travel expenses and saying it could not be anticipated is unacceptable. \n",
      " Here's the bottom line: Wilson made the decision to cut four men's sports teams because of an $800,000 deficit in the athletic department. She didn't consult with the community and didn't anticipate the outcry when it was publicly announced on June 11. \n",
      " If only she would stop trying to blame others for her blunder. In a nine-page letter released Friday, Wilson said, \"There was no attempt or intention to hide the fact of the deficit or to delay a decision until classes had ended. In fact, both campus newspapers and local media articles reported on the consideration of dropping sports in May, before the end of the summer. There was little campus or community reaction to the issue until sports columnists began to write articles strongly opposed to the university cutting baseball.\" \n",
      " Once again, Wilson misleads the public. The first mention of any potential cutting of sports at Northridge in local newspapers was on May 29, the day graduation ceremonies began and the day Bubb and Kopita held a press conference to inform the media that cuts were under consideration. That's hardly sufficient time for students and the community to debate the ramifications of the cuts or investigate how the deficit came about. \n",
      " This issue is not going away because Wilson and other Northridge administrators don't want to accept responsibility for their mismanagement. They didn't bother to ask for financial help from the community and failed to inform people of the crisis at hand until the decision had already been made to cut the sports. \n",
      " They can blame the media all they want for their troubles, but the community is outraged. Hiring a new marketing firm and new fundraising manager isn't going to put the athletic department in the black in the coming years. Restoring credibility will. But that's not going to happen when people try to hide from their mistakes. What corporations in the Valley are going to donate money to a school that ignores its own community? \n",
      " On July 16, at a meeting of the California State Universities Board of Trustees in Long Beach, Wilson will find out how upset the community truly is. That's the day community members can speak to the Board of Trustees in open session and finally get the hearing and public forum they deserve. Those who can't speak have been sending letters to chairwoman Martha Fallgatter, 400 Golden Shores, Suite 134, Long Beach, Calif., 90802. \n",
      " It's day No. 20 since Northridge killed baseball and volleyball from the athletic program. How many days will it take for Northridge administrators to fully understand the damage they have done to their school and the community?: [18143, 18120, 15738]\n",

      "In the biggest jail break ever in Los Angeles County, 14 inmates _ accused of murder or other serious crimes _ staged an escape from the troubled Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho. \n",
      " Despite a massive manhunt that shocked and disturbed neighbors of the sprawling jail facility in the northern Santa Clarita Valley about 32 miles north of downtown Los Angeles, four of the inmates from the rancho's medium/maximum-security North Facility were still at large late Sunday evening after escaping Sunday morning, authorities said. \n",
      " Four of the inmates were caught immediately. \n",
      " Six others, some hiding in nearby housing developments, were discovered throughout the day. \n",
      " As helicopters circled overhead, bloodhounds and deputies scoured the streets, and residents congregated on their sidewalks to watch as trouble hit their quiet neighborhood. \n",
      " \"This is a little too close to home,\" said Christine Wheeler, who lives in the North Bluff housing tract less than two miles from the jails. \"I keep telling myself that this just doesn't happen in my neighborhood _ let alone my back yard.\" \n",
      " She and her husband watched as sheriff's deputies, with rifles pointed, circled an empty residence and began a house-by-house search. Hugging themselves, the couple watched quietly as one of the inmates found hiding nearby was taken away in a patrol car. \n",
      " \"I'd like to ask (Sheriff) Sherman Block how 14 people could possibly do this at one time,\" said a disgusted Gerald Wheeler. \"What's going on over there?\" \n",
      " Residents were warned to check in and under their cars before driving. On one street, a patrol car slowly drove down the road, broadcasting a warning to residents to go into their houses and lock their doors. \n",
      " \"We're doing everything we can, the safety of the residents is of utmost concern,\" said Deputy George Ducoulombier, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman. \n",
      " \"You can always say that we should have been prepared for something like this, but nothing of this magnitude has ever happened before. Hopefully, we can all learn from it,\" Ducoulombier said. \n",
      " Still at large Sunday night were Eric Reed, 24, and Luis A. Galdamez, 28, both murder suspects; Walter R. Padilla, 22, facing carjacking charges; and Fernando Arroyo, 24, awaiting narcotics charges. \n",
      " The Pitchess ranch houses 21,000 inmates in four separate jails, ranging from medium to maximum security. All the inmates are on or awaiting trial. \n",
      " The facility, about a half-mile from the Golden State Freeway, has had more than 150 escapes. Most of those were from a fifth jail, a minimum-security facility recently closed because of budget cutbacks. \n",
      " About 3:15 a.m. Sunday, a \"disturbance\" was reported within the North Jail that probably was a diversion, Ducoulombier said. \n",
      " About that time, Sheriff Block said, the 14 inmates made their way through a ceiling vent to the roof. \n",
      " Ducoulombier said one deputy was monitoring the 96 inmates in that area, and it was unclear whether he had left his post. \n",
      " The fugitives were able to tie together sheets and blankets taken from nearby laundry bins, and used them to scale the lone fence topped with razor wire. \n",
      " A pool of blood, gloves and torn sheets and blankets were left at the scene. Authorities said some of the men taken into custody had been cut and injured and the inmates still at large could be injured. \n",
      " Five of the escapees were facing murder charges. Two were accused of carjacking, and three inmates were drug defendants. \n",
      " The escape was detected when a deputy patrolling outside the facility spotted four of the inmates trying to break out. Within 15 minutes, deputies had cordoned off the perimeter of the facility, authorities said. \n",
      " As the manhunt intensified, 118 deputies, five dogs and three helicopters were assigned to the search. \n",
      " At 12:55 p.m., a police dog following a trail of blood located Mario A. Cortez, accused of murder, hiding in the brush on the 2,800-acre jail complex. \n",
      " At that time, sheriff's officials speculated that the other fugitives had fled the area and had perhaps arranged someone to pick them up along Interstate 5. They were wrong. \n",
      " About 1:45 p.m., deputies knocked at Lisa Galvin's North Bluff tract home. After they explained about the breakout, they asked permission to search around the home. \n",
      " Used to frequent escapes from the facility, Galvin said she wasn't overly concerned. She took out her trash and went to straighten the covering over a car in her driveway. \n"

      "The Rangers yesterday demonstrated their aggressive commitment toward a second American League West title in three seasons. \n",
      " The cost: Additional payroll and a portion of the organization's future. \n",
      " General manager Doug Melvin acquired right-hander Todd Stottlemyre and shortstop Royce Clayton from the St. Louis Cardinals and third baseman Todd Zeile from the Florida Marlins before last night's deadline in separate but dependent trades designed toward strengthening the Rangers' present. \n",
      " \"I think it's going to help our ballclub,\" Melvin said, \"and there's no doubt what we did today is an effort to win our division and go beyond.\" \n",
      " The Cardinals received left-hander Darren Oliver, third baseman Fernando Tatis and a minor-league player to be announced. The Rangers also sent two minor-league players _ right-hander Daniel DeYoung of Class-A Charlotte and third baseman Jose Santo of Class-A Savannah _ to the Marlins. \n",
      " The Rangers also placed shortstop Kevin Elster on waivers for the purpose of granting the infielder his unconditional release three days before his 34th birthday. \n",
      " The two trades also signaled the financial commitment of owner Tom Hicks, who purchased the franchise in June. The Rangers will be responsible for approximately $3.15 million in additional salary for the season's eight remaining weeks. \n",
      " \"There's no doubt that you have to get approval when you're taking on additional salary over the last two months,\" Melvin said. \"I think it's helpful to have that kind of support, and I've had support in the past ... but this is a little bigger chunk than we've taken on in the past.\" \n",
      " Stottlemyre (9-9, 3.51 earned-run average) became the Rangers' primary focus after Melvin deemed the Blue Jays' demands excessive for right-hander Roger Clemens, a four-time Cy Young Award recipient. The Blue Jays, major-league officials said, sought left fielder Rusty Greer, Oliver and a premier prospect. \n",
      " \"I didn't feel it was something we were going to be able to do without disrupting our current major-league club and a big part of our future,\" Melvin said. \"I spent some time with that, but I got the message loud and clear: It was going to be expensive for me.\" \n",
      " Melvin said he also viewed Blue Jays right-hander Juan Guzman as the Rangers' fail-safe had the trade with the Cardinals failed. \n",
      " \"I was fairly close,\" Melvin said of a trade for Guzman. \"I feel if I wouldn't have been able to get Stottlemyre, I felt confident I could have gotten Guzman.\" \n",
      " Clayton, who during the past two seasons led National League shortstops in assists, addressed the Rangers' concerns regarding Elster's lack of range. \n",
      " \"We felt our defense had not played up to par,\" Melvin said. \"He's got very good range and athleticism. We feel he can help improve our pitching somewhat with his defense.\" \n",
      " The acquisitions do not come without risk. \n",
      " Stottlemyre and Clayton, who this season will earn $4.7 and $3.5 million, respectively, can become free agents this winter. The Rangers will not attempt to negotiate contract extensions for either during the season. \n",
      " \"Our focus is for the rest of the season,\" Melvin said. \"We'll make the other decisions at the end of the year.\" \n",
      " Zeile, who will earn $3.2 million this season and in 1999, should provide the Rangers more offensive production and consistency, but Melvin bemoaned the loss of Tatis, the team's 23-year-old third baseman. \n",
      " \"It was very difficult to give up a young player like Tatis,\" Melvin said. \"I think he's going to be an outstanding player.\" \n",
      " Melvin dismissed the idea that the Rangers sacrificed long-term success for a short-term fix. \n",
      " \"I don't think we're going that way,\" Melvin said. \"I wish we would have played better during the first half up to the trading deadline and you're not having to make these moves.\" \n",
      " Yesterday's maneuvers might not be the Rangers' last. \n",
      " \"I think our club is pretty well intact, but it doesn't mean I'll stop looking,\" Melvin said. \"There might be some tweaking.\": [10555, 10539, 8797]\n",

      "The dollar rose against the yen after the weaker-than-expected Bank of Japan quarterly \"tankan\" survey of business sentiment convinced traders the Japanese economy won't pick up anytime soon. \n",
      " Following the report, the yield on the Japanese benchmark 10-year government bond touched a record low 1.8 percent amid expectations the Bank of Japan won't raise interest rates. Japanese stocks also fell. \n",
      " \"Given declining Japanese long-term rates and weakening Japanese stocks, what are we going to do,\" asked Masahiro Yamaguchi, manager for foreign exchange at Tokai Bank Ltd. \"Everyone is searching for places to invest for better returns. I think Japanese can't help buying foreign securities.\" \n",
      " That undermines the yen because Japanese need to sell yen for dollars and other currencies to invest abroad. \n",
      " The dollar was quoted at 121.15 yen, up from 120.51 yen in late New York trading yesterday. It was quoted at 1.7620 marks, up from 1.7611 marks in New York. \n",
      " In the tankan survey of about 10,000 managers, the sentiment index for major manufacturers dwindled to 3, down from 7 in the previous survey in June. That was also down from 5 forecast by economists polled by Bloomberg News. \n",
      " The index is computed by subtracting the percentage of managers who foresee worsening business conditions from the percentage who predict conditions will improve. A lower number shows increasing pessimism about the business outlook for the next three to six months. \n",
      " \"The tankan result isn't good,\" said Yukihiko Hashimoto, manager for foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd., immediately after the release of the report. Still, he said \"you can't say the dollar is `yours\"' and sell dollars for yen as a knee-jerk reaction. \n",
      " The survey results confirm that the Japanese economy remains too weak to allow the Bank of Japan to raise interest rates. \n",
      " The central bank has kept the discount rate, at which it lends money overnight to banks, at an all-time low of 0.5 percent since September 1995. That hurts the yen by making yen-denominated deposits less attractive. \n",
      " After initially surging on the bleak picture painted by the `tankan' survey, the dollar soon reversed course, and briefly fell as low as 120.38 yen. That reflected concern a rapid decline by the yen might prompt Japanese Finance Ministry officials to talk up the Japanese currency, traders said. \n",
      " Prompting that concern was a comment made last week by Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international affairs. On Sept. 24, Sakakibara said the Group of Seven finance ministers' latest accord sent a strong message on dollar-yen exchange rates. The accord said \"avoiding excessive depreciation\" is important. \n",
      " Spellbinding \n",
      " \"We haven't been liberated from the psychological spellbinding\" that Japanese officials may either talk up the yen or ask the Bank of Japan to sell dollars for yen, said Yasuhisa Morikuni, a customer trader at Bank of America. \n",
      " Although the dollar subsequently reversed course and topped 121 yen once again, several traders said the dollar is unlikely to rise much from current levels. \n",
      " Sakakibara spoke out last week when the dollar was trading between 121 and 122 yen. His comments followed the meeting of G-7 finance ministers and central bankers in Hong Kong on Sept. 20. The G-7 are the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, the U.K., Italy and Canada. \n",
      " In the Hong Kong meeting, the G-7 said in a statement they \"emphasized the importance of avoiding excessive depreciation where this could lead to the reemergence of large external imbalances.\" \n",
      " Sakakibara's comments suggested that the G-7 message meant monetary officials don't want to see the yen's rapid decline. A weaker yen would boost Japan's trade surplus by making Japanese exports less expensive abroad. \n",
      " Yuhiko Kaji, manager in the foreign exchange and international treasury division at Sakura Bank Ltd., said traders may sell the dollar when it rallies amid concern that the U.S. Congress, if the dollar keeps rising, may put pressure on the Clinton Administration to take a tougher stance against Japan on trade issues. That could affect U.S. foreign exchange policy. \n",
      " U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has said the U.S. supports a strong dollar. When he yesterday said Japan's trade surplus continues to be a problem for the U.S., some traders sold dollars amid speculation the U.S. might soften its support for a strong dollar. \n",
      " In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.4503 Swiss francs, compared with 1.4475 Swiss francs in late New York trading yesterday. The British pound was quoted at $1.6177, up from $1.6156 in New York. The mark was quoted at 68.76 yen, up from 68.41 yen in New York. \n"

      " Somebody said, \"Well, how's your mother doing?\" I said, \"You know, I've learned an interesting lesson and that is, you can never escape your mother, no matter what your job is or how old you are.\" I was giving a speech in Fredericksburg, Texas, one time. It's in central Texas. I was there, my dad was there, my brother was there, my mom was there. . . . My dad was the speaker, and I got up to say, \"Mr. President, welcome to central Texas,\" and there was a nice group of applause. I said, \"Mother,\" and before I could say anything else, the place went wild. I said, \"Mother, it is clear the people of Texas still love you, and so do I. But you are still telling me what to do after 50 years.\" True story: a guy in a big cowboy hat strode out in the middle of Main Street, Fredericksburg, Tex., cups his hands and screams, \"And you better listen to her, too, boy!\" \n",
      " It's pretty good advice. I have listened to her. She talks about duty and service. She talks about honor and dignity. She said, \"If you ever get elected to public office, don't be sticking your finger in the air to try to figure out which way the wind is blowing. Do what you think is right.\" I've got a famous mother, and I've got a great wife. I am sorry that Laura's not here so I can introduce you to her. The best decision I ever made _ the best decision I ever made _ was to ask Laura Bush to marry me. I'm not so sure the best decision she ever made was to say yes. The thing I love most about Laura is that she understands, like I understand, that the most important job title we'll ever have is not first lady or governor. It is mom and dad. \n",
      " We are the proud parents of 17-year-old twin daughters. I don't know what's harder: running for president or raising those girls. But I do know I love them, I love them a lot. Which caused me to hesitate about seeking the presidency. I wasn't sure that I wanted to subject them to what I knew would happen to 17-year-old twin daughters. One of them was reading the newspaper the other day. She said, \"Daddy, I've been reading about you in the newspapers. And I've been reading about those polls. You are not nearly as cool as the people think you are.\" She may be right, but I want to share with you, if you don't mind _ I understand this is a Chamber of Commerce banquet, but I've got to seize the moment _ I want to share with you why I've asked the three ladies of my life to make an incredible sacrifice and join me in the quest to become your president, to become your president. \n",
      " And here's why: I feel incredibly fortunate to be an American. I love our country. I love what our country stands for. I love Americans. I'm running for president because I want our nation to be prosperous as we head into the 21st century, but there must be a purpose to prosperity. And the purpose of prosperity is to see to it that the American dream, the great American dream, touches every willing heart. The purpose of prosperity must be so that people don't feel left out in our country or feel left behind. I'm running because I want the political party with which I'm associated to match our conservative minds with our compassionate hearts. And I'm running to win the respect of the people of America and I'm running to do one thing, and that is to become the next president of the United States. \n",
      " I hope you understand what I know: that prosperity is not a given. It just doesn't happen. In all due respect to some of the elected officials in Washington and in the executive branch, if you listen carefully, it sounds like they think they invented prosperity. They no more invented prosperity than they invented the Internet. You and I know the role of government is not to create wealth. That's not the role of government. The role of government is to create an environment in which entrepreneurship flourishes, in which small businesses become big businesses, in which some youngster may have a dream about becoming a high-tech businessperson and is willing to risk capital to do so. So the proper role of government is to create an environment that's conducive to capital. . . . \n",
      " We will be prosperous if we embrace free trade. I intend to work to end barriers and tariffs everywhere entirely so that the entire world _ I mean the entire world _ trades in freedom. I'm going to remind people in this country that it is the fearful who build walls _ it is the fearful who build walls. It is the confident who tear them down. And I am confident in the North Dakota farmer. I am confident in the American entrepreneur. I am confident in American enterprise, and I am confident that the best in America is the best in the entire world. . . . \n",
      " America must not retreat. We must not withdraw within our borders. We must seize the moment and lead the world to peace, which we can do. And we always have got to remember that the greatest export we have to this world is, and always will be, the incredible freedom we understand in the great land called America. \n",
      " So we'll be prosperous and strong if we do the right things. But it is important to remember that prosperity alone is simple materialism. There has to be a great purpose to our prosperity. The success of America has never been proven by cities of gold, but by our citizens of character. ... Should I be fortunate enough to earn the confidence of the American people, I'll be an activist president who sets a tone, a positive tone, an optimistic tone, and I'll set goals worthy of a great nation. I will not _ I will not _ use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion. \n",

      "Rebuffing broadcasters and civil liberties groups, a sharply divided federal appeals court Friday upheld regulations that prohibit radio and television stations from carrying sexually oriented \"indecent\" programs between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. \n",
      " The 7-4 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit essentially preserves restrictions that Congress imposed in 1993. The court emphatically rejected arguments by broadcasters that the restrictions were too broad and said the government had a \"compelling interest\" in shielding children from steamy programs beamed over the airwaves. \n",
      " \"It is fanciful to believe that the vast majority of parents who wish to shield their children from indecent material can effectively do so without meaningful restrictions on the airwaves,\" said the opinion, written by Judge James L. Buckley. \n",
      " The decision is a turning point in a tortuous eight-year legal battle over steps by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to clamp down on steamy programming. \n",
      " Twice, the same appellate court has rejected efforts to expand earlier restrictions, saying the proposed expansions were too broad to be constitutional. \n",
      " Friday's ruling comes at a time when Congress has aggressively sought to impose new restrictions on sexual material over television and computer networks, and when presidential candidates like Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas are making attacks on such material a prominent part of their campaigns. \n",
      " The court itself split along political lines. All seven Republican appointees supported the rules; all four Democratic appointees issued lengthy dissents. \n",
      " The plaintiffs are virtually certain to appeal to the Supreme Court. The suit was brought by broadcasters and an alliance of civil liberties groups, led by Action for Children's Television, a nonprofit organization. \n",
      " The ruling Friday, by a full panel of the court, will bring little immediate change to what people see or hear over radio and television, and it does not apply at all to cable television. But it is likely to lead to tighter restrictions, because the court left the government ample room to expand the prohibition to midnight from 10 p.m. \n",
      " As a result, media experts said Friday, the decision could affect shows like ABC's hit series \"NYPD Blue,\" which is usually broadcast at 10 p.m. and periodically contains profane language and nudity. \n",
      " \"Parents and the public are the winners,\" said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt after Friday's decision was released. \"The court's action serves the goal of confining this material to the hours when minors are less likely to be exposed.\" \n",
      " Broadcasters and other opponents of restrictions on indecency called the decision a major defeat. \n",
      " \"It's very disappointing,\" said Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer who represented the major television networks and argued the case, \"and it is a sharp departure from the approach reflected in earlier court decisions.\" \n",
      " Peggy Charren, head of Action for Children's Television, said the decision was chilling. \"Too often, we try to protect children by doing in free speech,\" Ms. Charren said. \"Indecency to some people might be sex education, and that's the problem. \n",
      " \"Who defines indecency? The censors define it.\" \n",
      " Federal restrictions on \"indecency\" over television and radio have been a quagmire for policy makers. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that the government had a right to restrict indecency in broadcasting, and initial definitions were largely couched in terms of the famous \"seven dirty words\" described by the comedian George Carlin. \n",
      " \"Indecent\" programming has been broadly defined by the courts as \"patently offensive\" language or material that depicts \"sexual or excretory activities or organs.\" \n",
      " The courts have said that indecency is milder than obscenity and pornography, which entail graphic pictures or descriptions of sex that are not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech. \n",

      "More than a year after the State Ethics Commission began looking into three dozen pension fund investments made by Connecticut's corrupt former treasurer, a Dallas-based investment firm on Thursday became the first to agree to pay a cash settlement to avoid further scrutiny. \n",
      " State officials hope the settlement, worth $1.2 million, will be the first of several they reach in the months ahead with investment firms under investigation for their dealings with former Treasurer Paul J. Silvester. In September 1999, Silvester pleaded guilty to federal bribery and money laundering charges for agreeing to invest in certain firms if the firms paid huge fees to his friends and family members. \n",
      " The $1.2 million to be paid by the Dallas firm, Crossroads Investment Co., is punishment for having paid what the Ethics Commission determined were illegal contingency fees to two Hartford-region consultants who helped the firm gain access to treasury officials starting in 1987. It would be the largest settlement ever collected by the Ethics Commission, which enforces state lobbying and financial disclosure laws. \n",
      " Whether the state will get the money, however, depends on the outcome of a Superior Court case between Crossroads and the two local consultants, George C. Finley, of West Hartford, Conn., and Peter G. Kelly, of Glastonbury, Conn. \n",
      " In return for their political access, the two men received hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees from Crossroads. But after Crossroads stopped paying them last year, they filed suit to collect the amount they said was owed them _ $1.2 million. \n",
      " Crossroads agreed to pay the settlement only if it won the lawsuit and the right to retain the $1.2 million it has withheld from Finley and Kelly. \n",
      " The commission also fined the firm $2,000 for making the contingency payments, but Alan S. Plofsky, the executive director, stressed that Crossroads had inadvertently, not intentionally, violated Connecticut's lobbying laws. \n",
      " \"The money is important, but the principal is more important,\" Plofsky said. \"We hope that this will be the first of several settlements with the funds.\" \n",
      " John Buser, chief operating and chief financial officer of Crossroads, declined to comment publicly on the settlement, citing the ongoing lawsuit with Kelly and Finley. \n",
      " Crossroads currently has contracts to invest about $300 million of the state's $22 billion pension funds, said Howard Rifkin, the deputy state treasurer. There are no immediate plans to cancel the state's contracts with the firm, he added. \n",
      " The federal government last month indicted four people who prosecutors said profited enormously from illegal payments orchestrated by Silvester. \n",
      " The four indicted are Ben F. Andrews Jr., 59, a former adviser to Gov. John Rowland who ran for secretary of the state on Rowland's ticket in 1998; Lisa A. Thiesfield, 30, of Hartford, who managed Silvester's 1998 election campaign; and Frederick W. McCarthy, 57, and Charles B. Spadoni, 52, both of Triumph Capital Group, a Boston firm in which Silvester invested state pension funds in return, prosecutors said, for payments to Andrews and Thiesfield. \n",
      " Aside from the ongoing federal investigation, the Ethics Commission is investigating about 19 firms, lawyers and lobbyists and their relationships and the fee arrangements with Silvester, 38, who is still giving information to federal investigators and has yet to be sentenced. \n",
      " Among those under scrutiny are Kelly, a Hartford lawyer and prominent Democrat who was a pillar of Vice President Al Gore's presidential fund-raising network in Connecticut, and Finley, a lawyer in West Hartford. \n",
      " Both men have repeatedly said they have done nothing illegal or unethical. \n",
      " R. Bartley Halloran, the lawyer representing Kelly and Finley, denounced the timing of Thursday's announcement, while the two men's lawsuit against Crossroads is still pending in Superior Court. He also called the agreement toothless because it demands that Crossroads pay to the state only what it was obliged, according to Halloran, to pay his clients. \n",
      " The $1.2 million Crossroads payment, he also said, includes a waiver of the $548,623 the firm has spent on legal fees to defend itself against Finley and Kelly's suit. \"By paying a $2,000 fine,\" Halloran said, \"they are getting a $500,000 benefit.\": [9361, 9338, 7610]\n",

      "Over the last 15 years, as executive pay has soared and each new plateau has met with something of a public outcry, America's business leaders and their supporters have had a ready answer for the critics: Look at the stock market. \n",
      " In 1988, when the average pay of chief executives at large companies first topped $2 million, the Dow Jones industrial average ended the year at 2,168. By 1995, when average pay hit $5.8 million, the Dow had reached 5,117. \n",
      " On Dec. 31, 1999, the end of a year in which the average pay package reached $11.9 million, the index closed at 11,497. \n",
      " The two numbers have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship, the executives argue, as the promise of wealth, in the form of stock options, has inspired them to create efficient companies that are driving the longest economic expansion in American history. \n",
      " To a large extent, the debate is over, and the executives have won. \n",
      " Companies in Europe and Asia are starting to mimic the American system by raising salaries and awarding more stock. Dot-com billionaires have made the fortunes of some old-line executives look moderate. And eight years after Bill Clinton made exorbitant executive pay an issue in his first presidential campaign, the topic has disappeared from the political scene. \n",
      " Yet at this moment of triumph _ when nine-digit packages are a reality and eight-digit annual pay is the norm _ there is a rising undercurrent of concern over the very thing that executives credit with helping motivate the country's stunning growth: the tremendous boom in stock options. \n",
      " Over the last five years, America's companies have handed over a large portion of themselves to the executives who run them. That has aligned management's interests with investors, delighting those who advocate tying executive pay to performance. \n",
      " But a growing number of analysts warn that it has also created the potential for a host of long-term problems that could undercut economic growth. \n",
      " As top executives (and other employees) continue to exercise their rising pile of options over the next decade, other stockholders will see their stakes watered down. It seems unavoidable. Already, companies have spent billions of dollars in recent years _ and taken on rising levels of debt _ buying back shares to minimize the dilution. \n",
      " For the repurchasing to continue at its current pace, a recent Federal Reserve study warned, companies would have to devote virtually all of their future earnings to buybacks. \n",
      " In essence, the skeptics worry, corporate America is using stock options like a credit card without a spending limit. While every penny in salary is recorded as a cost on company books, hundreds of billions of dollars in stock options aren't counted at all. To the fire of a blazing stock market, companies add the fuel of overly rosy earnings reports, unencumbered by off-the-books promises of future pay. \n",
      " In a speech last summer, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, said stock options helped \"impede judgments about prospective earnings\" and, over the last five years, had caused companies to overstate profit growth by one to two percentage points each year. \n",
      " The level of exaggeration is on the rise, doubling between 1997 and 1998, according to a study by Bear Stearns. At some companies _ including Cisco Systems, a new-economy stalwart that briefly last week boasted the highest market capitalization in the world _ earnings would be more than 20 percent lower if stock options were accounted for. \n",
      " \"The dilution is a serious financial problem, and it ought to be getting a lot of attention,\" said John C. Bogle, the founder and former chairman of the Vanguard Group, the big mutual fund company. \n",
      " Not everyone agrees, to be sure. By attracting and motivating the best workers and managers, stock options spur long-term growth at a faster rate than they dilute a company's shares, many executives argue, giving stockholders better net returns than they would have received otherwise. \n",
      " \"I'm a great believer in stock options,\" said Dennis Powell, the controller of Cisco, one of the stock market's best performers over the last decade. \n",
      " In addition, companies publish their level of \"overhang\" _ the percentage of the company that options would represent if all were exercised _ allowing investors to factor it into their decisions. And widely published statistics on diluted earnings per share take into account any options that currently have value. \n",
      " But a growing number of investors remain skittish. Fund managers at TIAA-CREF, a $288 billion pension and mutual fund company, are more often using their proxies to vote against executive pay plans. Over all, the proportion of such plans that meet tough resistance is up. And a New York Stock Exchange task force has recommended tightening guidelines to force companies to seek shareholder approval of almost all options plans. \n",
      " \"For the first time, you're starting to see mainstream institutional investors become concerned that the decade-long stock-option binge has left companies with serious, structural earnings problems,\" said Patrick S. McGurn, the director of corporate programs at Institutional Shareholder Services, a Rockville, Md., group that advises large investors. \n",

      "More Californians are joining the ranks of the rich, according to a study released Wednesday, including in Los Angeles and Ventura counties where the percentage of six-figure households is among the highest in California. \n",
      " More than 915,000 households in the state have annual incomes of $100,000 or more, an increase of 21.9 percent since 1990, according to the report from Acxiom Corp., a Conway, Ark.,-based data analysis service. And by decade's end, the number is expected to swell to more than 1 million households. \n",
      " In Los Angeles County, 9.5 percent of households were at or above the $100,000 mark, compared with 7.8 percent in 1990. Ventura County's six-figure households are at 10.4 percent, up from 9.3 percent. \n",
      " The study shows that there's a significant segment of the population whose income is growing more rapidly than others _ specifically, those who are already wealthy and whose pay includes equity in the companies that employ them, said John Karevoll, an analyst in Acxiom's La Jolla office. \n",
      " \"In other words, they get stock options; they get a piece of the action,\" he said. \n",
      " Nearly 9 percent of the state's households are at or above $100,000, compared with 6 percent for the nation as a whole, the study said. That's up for the state from 1990's 7 percent, when the nationwide average was 4.4 percent that year. \n",
      " Northern California had four of the top 10 counties, with three heading the list: Marin (18.4 percent), north of San Francisco; Santa Clara (13.6 percent), home of the Silicon Valley; and San Mateo (13.5 percent), which is wedged between San Francisco and the Silicon Valley. \n",
      " Orange (13 percent) and Northern California's Contra Costa (12.1 percent) counties separated Los Angeles and Ventura from the top five. \n",
      " Los Angeles' ranking didn't surprise Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp., who said the county did \"very well\" when compared with the disproportionately represented Silicon Valley counties, where jobs tend to be more lucrative _ and where compensation is largely in the form of stock options. \n",
      " \"That's what's going on in the Silicon Valley, that is one of the major currencies in that whole technology sector there,\" he said. \"You have to say Orange County (also) has a major technology sector.\" \n",
      " But the recent stock market turmoil that has sent share prices spiraling downward in recent months could change that. \"The air has gone out of that bubble a little bit,\" he said. \n",
      " In Los Angeles, people in the six-figure income group are likely to be in the entertainment, technology and financial services industries, as well as in more \"mundane\" sectors like the apparel industry, he said. \n",
      " \"There has been a lot of discussion about the shrinking middle class in terms of upper income households,\" he said. \"We have a lot of industries that could yield a lot of newcomers to that (upper income) roster.\" \n",
      " Also, it might be better to consider absolute numbers rather than percentages. \n",
      " For example, Marin County's population of 246,000 is barely a dot compared with Los Angeles's 9.5 million _ a number that would give the county the nation's ninth-largest population were it a separate state. \n",
      " \"Relatively speaking, you have to keep in mind the size of the universe you're dealing with,\" Kyser said. \"For a large county, I'd say Los Angeles is doing very well.\" \n",
      " As for the rate of growth within that six-figure income segment of the population, Los Angeles is somewhere in the middle _ a result of the recession of the early 1990s, which hit the county particularly hard, Karevoll said. \n",
      " \"The most current data indicates that the growth rate is catching up,\" he said. \"We expect household income and job generation to grow at a faster rate, only because Los Angeles was coming up from a worse situation and (had) more of a recovery to do.\" \n",
      " The county lost about 200,000 aerospace jobs, all of them high paying, as a result of the recession, said Rajeev Dhawan, director of econometric forecasting in The Anderson School at UCLA. \n",
      " Since then, the county has regained only 80,000 to 100,000 jobs, though very few are high-paying, he said. Among the industries that filled the gap was the entertainment industry. \n",
      " \"The problem with entertainment is that very few people make the top dollar,\" Dhawan said. \"The rest of the people are working for survival wages.\" \n",
      " The county has pockets of high-tech jobs, most of them in the western part of the San Fernando Valley, and a number of the health maintenance organizations in the Valley pay higher wages as well, he said. \n",
      " \"But you still haven't made it up in terms of high paying jobs,\" he said. \n",
      " Overall, the engine of California's economic growth has been in Northern California, which is filled with what Dhawan called \"fancy growth\" industries that are now getting hit by the stock market turmoil. \n",
      " Given the roiling market, Los Angeles in a sense could count itself fortunate for having less of that. \"The good side of not having a lot of fancy growth is that we don't suffer too much when it goes away,\" he said. \n",

      "General Motors Corp. agreed on Thursday to recall nearly a half-million late-model Cadillacs and spend nearly $45 million in fines and other costs, settling a federal complaint that the automaker had installed devices that caused the cars to emit illegal amounts of carbon monoxide. \n",
      " The company agreed to pay $11 million in fines, about $30 million on recalling and repairing the cars and almost $4 million in compensatory spending on programs to help control air pollution, senior officials of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department said. \n",
      " Government lawyers said they believe the company knew the design change would cause pollution problems, an assertion the company denied. \n",
      " In a statement, General Motors called the case \"a matter of interpretation\" of complex regulations. But the statement said the company had \"worked extremely hard to resolve the matter and avoid litigation.\" \n",
      " The civil penalty of $11 million is the third largest ever assessed in a pollution case, the second largest in a case under the Clean Air Act, and the largest involving pollution from motor vehicles, the officials of the environmental agency and Justice Department said. \n",
      " The settlement, if approved by the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C., where it was filed Thursday, would be the first time a court has ordered a recall of automobiles in order to curb pollution, rather than to improve safety or dependability. \n",
      " According to the government agencies, General Motors in 1990 designed a new computer chip for the engine controls on Cadillac Seville and DeVille models, after customers complained that the cars had a tendency to stall when the system that operates heating and air conditioning was running. \n",
      " The new chips were programmed to inject additional fuel into the engine whenever this climate control system was in operation. \n",
      " But the resulting exhaust was too rich in carbon monoxide for the cars' catalytic converters to clean, and the tailpipe emissions rose to double or triple allowable levels, the officials said. \n",
      " The cars are typically driven with climate control on but, like other cars, when they are certified at the factory as meeting the pollution control standards, they are tested with the systems off. Therefore, the Cadillacs' the high pollution levels would not register in those tests, the officials said. \n",
      " Under the Clean Air Act, the officials said, General Motors should have informed the agency that it had changed the car's design in a way that resulted in pollution violations during normal driving. The agency directed automakers in the 1970s not to take advantage of the testing rules to design cars that would cause unnecessary pollution, and GM's competitors obeyed, the officials said. \n",
      " \"GM's actions constituted a serious violation of the Clean Air Act and undermined EPA's efforts to improve air quality,\" said Steven Herman, assistant administrator of enforcement at the environmental agency. \"Since the vehicle certification program depends on complete and accurate information supplied by automobile manufacturers, GM's conduct jeopardized the integrity of the program.\" \n",
      " The settlement was announced at the Justice Department by Attorney General Janet Reno, emphasizing the importance that the administration placed on it. \n",
      " EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said it was exactly the kind of case that would be hampered by proposed cuts in the agency's spending on enforcement. \n",
      " Carbon monoxide is one of the six main air pollutants governed by the health-based standards of the Clean Air Act. It can contribute to heart and lung ailments. \n",
      " Betsy Hemming, a GM spokeswoman, said that there was no reason for the company to ever have tested emissions with the car's climate control operating. \n",
      " \"It was not in the rules, not in the regulations; it's not in the Clean Air Act,\" she said. \n",
      " But Lois J. Schiffer, assistant attorney general for environment, said: \"We think GM knew what it was doing.\" \n",
      " Thomas P. Carroll, a Justice Department environmental lawyer, was particularly critical of General Motors for continuing to build the chip into the 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995 Cadillacs after discovering the problem in 1991. \n",
      " \"They should have gone back and re-engineered it to improve the emissions,\" he said. \n",
      " He said three separate violations of law took place: the cars were equipped with a device that overwhelmed the emissions control system, the devices were not identified in descriptions of the vehicles provided to the Environmental Protection Agency, and with the installation of the computer chips at repair shops, the cars from the 1991 model year were tampered with after their sale in a way that reduced their compliance with emissions standards. \n",
      " The pollution was detected during testing for research purposes by the EPA. \n",
      " The company agreed on Thursday to recall and fix more than 470,000 Cadillacs _ those built from 1991 to 1995 with a 4.9 liter engine that is no longer produced. \n",
      " The company said it had designed a way to control the original stalling problem without increasing pollution. \n",
      " The corrective measures involve \"new fueling calibrations,\" the company said, which will meet expected future emissions standards and \"should have no adverse effect on the driveability of the vehicles involved.\" \n",
      " The company also agreed to to carry out remedial projects such as paying to replace school buses with cleaner models or buying older cars and junking them. \n",
      " The only bigger civil penalty under the Clean Air Act was a $11.1 million fine levied against Louisiana-Pacific Corp. in 1993 for air pollution violations at its wood-products plants. \n"

      " Melanson and her twin brother were whisked away from their par ents' hogan by a public-health nurse when they were two days old. The twins became two of the thousands of \"Lost Birds,\" Indian children often taken illegally and adopted by white families from 1950s to the 1970s. \n",
      " Raised in New York by her adoptive parents, who have since died, Melanson did not learn she was Navajo until April, when a posting on the Internet led her to her family in Tolani Lake. \n",
      " Speaking in her unmistakable Brooklyn accent, Melanson acknowl edges that she knows nothing about her people's culture. But she and her husband, Dickie, and her two preteen daughters got a crash course on Friday in Tolani Lake. \n",
      " Freddie Howard, who represents Tolani Lake in the Navajo Nation Council, told Melanson that they are both members of the Salt Clan. And he thanked the prayers of the \"holy people for bringing our child back within the four sacred mountains.\" \n",
      " Her father, Yazzie Monroe, who last saw his daughter in the arms of the public-health nurse in 1953, gave her a wedding basket and placed a string of turquoise beads around her neck. The beads hung over her Star of David necklace, a symbol of the Jewish girl who had learned Hebrew and spent several years in Israel. \n",
      " Melanson was overwhelmed by the attention, the gifts and the energy of the buckskinned war dancers. \n",
      " \"They amaze me,\" she said. \"I've never seen anything like that.\" \n",
      " She also marveled at the Navajo landscape. \n",
      " \"I've never seen mountains that go straight up,\" she said, referring to the high, dark-walled mesas that stud the reservation. \n",
      " There have been other reunions of Lost Birds with their Navajo families, but they have been private ceremo nies. \n",
      " However, the tribe and Melanson agreed to allow the media and other Navajos to attend her homecoming in hopes the publicity will help them find her still-lost twin and other missing adoptees. \n",
      " The tribe also believes that Melan son's story underscores the impor tance of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act, which is under attack in Congress. The House-passed version of the bill would remove child custody proceedings from tribal courts if the cases involve children whose birth parents did not maintain \"significant social, cultural or political affiliations with the tribe.\" \n",
      " Tribes say the vague language could open the door for state courts to decide that some children are not \"Indian enough,\" allowing them to be adopted by white families. \n",
      " Melanson's story is typical of the illegal adoptions that tribes say occurred on reservations after World War II. \n",
      " Melanson's late mother, Betty Jackson, was ill after the twins' birth and placed her thumbprint on what she thought were temporary-custody papers. The documents apparently allowed the children to be adopted. \n",
      " Melanson was taken to Salt Lake City. She has since learned that her birth certificate was falsified, saying she had been born in Salt Lake City to white parents. \n",
      " Melanson said that during her two-week stay on the reservation, she hopes to learn enough of the Navajo language and culture to speak to her father, a medicine man believed to be about 67 who speaks little English. \n"

      "School has been out at Cal State Northridge since the week before Christmas, but since you can learn something every day, Mississippi State's women's basketball team gave a lesson. \n",
      " Northridge has talked about taking its game to the next level. The 21st-ranked Bulldogs _ the first nationally ranked team to play here in Northridge's Division I era _ gave a glimpse of that level in a 98-64 nonconference victory before a crowd of 165 Friday night. \n",
      " It ended CSUN's 16-game home win streak. \n",
      " Whether the Matadors learned from the Bulldogs (10-0) remains to be seen. The Big Sky Conference season begins Thursday at Northern Arizona, but the Matadors don't believe they'll face anyone of this caliber. \n",
      " \"Our conference isn't that strong,\" Edneisha Curry admitted, \"so we have to play hard and play with the type of desire and heart night in and night out, so we can play with Mississippi State and all the other ranked teams.\" \n",
      " For now, they have completed the most difficult portion of the schedule with two losses to nationally ranked teams in Illinois and Mississippi State and a win over an NCAA Tournament team in Dartmouth. It leaves them 6-4, the same record they had at this time last year. \n",
      " Then again, they weren't talking about elevating their game at this time last year. Since the Matadors have reached the NCAA Tournament and are hungry for more, Mississippi State provided clues to what they need to do. \n",
      " It's the basics: shoot a high percentage, rebound well and commit fewer turnovers and fouls. Shooting 36.7 percent, taking just 28 boards and committing 17 turnovers might be enough to win the Big Sky, but it won't get you past Mississippi State, which shot 50.7 percent and took 51 rebounds. Although the Bulldogs turned over the ball the same number of times, they also committed six fewer fouls. \n",
      " It also helps to have a player like freshman LaToya Thomas, who can deliver points in bunches when needed. Thomas scored 33, including 18 in the first half, but was most valuable in the second half when she scored eight points in a 10-0 run that ended any hope of a Northridge comeback. CSUN had cut a 50-25 halftime deficit to 59-45 with 12:21 to play and had some momentum. \n",
      " \"Our goal in the second half was to cut it to 10 by the 10-minute mark,\" CSUN coach Frozena Jerro said. \n",
      " Actually, Northridge has a Thomas-like player in Curry, who scored 21 points. But she made 9 of 23 field-goal attempts, far below Thomas' 11 of 18. \n",
      " The other time Northridge was close was when it scored eight straight points and trailed 13-12 with 12:46 to play in the first half. Mississippi State responded with a 25-7 run in 9:10 to put the game out of reach. \n",
      " \"Right now, they're getting a lot of experience,\" Bulldogs coach Sharon Faning said. \"They need to work on footwork, defense, rebounding _ same as us.\" \n",
      " Three other Mississippi State players scored in double figures: Jennifer Fambrough (22), Cynthia Hall (11) and Meadow Overstreet (11). Northridge got 14 from Lynda Amari and 13 from LaShaunda Fowler.: [9993, 9976, 8292]\n",

      "An achy foot, a painful performance and an All-NBA nod combined to make an interesting 24 hours for Kobe Bryant. \n",
      " In an odd bit of timing, Bryant was named to the All-NBA second team Wednesday, just a day after his six turnovers and shaky shooting contributed to the Lakers' Game 5 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. \n",
      " \"I'm honored,\" Bryant said. \"Being third-team last year and moving up to second team, it's a serious honor.\" \n",
      " Shaquille O'Neal was a unanimous selection (Fred Hickman presumably included) as the NBA's top center, marking his second election to the first team. \n",
      " Bryant earned 45 first-team votes but was only the fourth-highest guard in the balloting, behind first-teamers Gary Payton and Jason Kidd and second-teamer Allen Iverson. Bryant said he's not disappointed, however. \n",
      " \"I'm happy to be on the second team,\" he said. \"It gives me something to work for next year.\" \n",
      " In the meantime, he has plenty to work on before the conference finals resume Friday. Early foul trouble and some reckless play made Game 5 one of his worst performances of the postseason. \n",
      " \"I just had a lot of turnovers, mistakes, bad decisions,\" he said. \"I mean, it's something that we all did. But no biggie, just forget it. ... \n",
      " \"I just kind of have to give them different looks, as far as my positioning on the court. Kind of mix it up. ... I just kind of have to play different positions within the triangle (offense), kind of throw them off guard a little bit, throw the defense off balance.\" \n",
      " Bryant, who coach Phil Jackson called \"a lot out of control\" in Game 5, admitted he was too eager to try to take over the game. \n",
      " \"Without a doubt,\" he said. \"Just relax, let the game come to you. It's tough, man, because especially when you try to do that, then you get in foul trouble situations and you can't find your rhythm. It can be tough sometimes.\" \n",
      " Bryant's sprained right foot, suffered in the first quarter Tuesday, forced Jackson to limit his activity Wednesday, but he's expected to be fine for Friday's game. \n",
      " \"I couldn't stop and cut, I couldn't really plant off my right foot, but it will heal with time,\" he said. \n",
      " MISFIRING: Jackson had varied explanations for the Lakers' 38 percent shooting on Tuesday. \n",
      " \"Some of it was was settling for shots, some of it was confusion, and we have to give Portland some credit for being very active on the defensive end. As a consequence, we didn't stay aggressive on the offensive end,\" he said. \n",
      " Portland's double-teaming of O'Neal and Bryant has opened spaces for other Lakers, but only Ron Harper (14 points) took advantage Tuesday. \n",
      " \"The rest of the players have not stepped into that vacuum,\" Jackson said. \"Robert (Horry) has not made but one outside shot in the last 12 quarters, and he's a better shooter than that. He's got to shoot. I challenged these guys today about their shooting, and we spent a lot of time just getting the rhythm back in our offense.\" \n",
      " The starkest dropoff came from Glen Rice, who scored a postseason-high 21 points Sunday, then a playoffs-low 4 points Tuesday. \n",
      " \"I think a lot of it has to do with Portland's defense,\" Rice said. \"They didn't allow us to get into our offense easy like we were able to the game before. ... If we can go out there and execute the way we know how, set screens and move bodies, things will come a little easier for us.\" \n",

      "M.I.M. Holdings Ltd., Australia's largest domestic producer of base metals, reported a net loss of A$12 million (US$9.4 million) for the six months ended Dec. 31, 1996, mainly due to lower metals prices and a stronger currency. \n",
      " The result, compared with profit of A$58.9 million in the year-earlier period, was marginally better than analysts' expectations of a loss of between A$15 million and A$20 million. The shares closed up one cent to A$1.75. \n",
      " The figures included a one-time loss of A$2.2 million, compared with a A$38.9 million gain in the year-earlier period. The first-half dividend was halved to 1.25 cents. \n",
      " \"It's an expected result given what happened with the copper fiasco last year and what happened to the dollar,\" said M.I.M. Chief Executive Nick Stump. \n",
      " Copper prices plunged in the middle of last year after Japanese metal-trading company Sumitomo Corp. lost more than US$1.8 billion on unauthorized trades. \n",
      " M.I.M.'s sales for the half-year were down 15 percent to A$1.1 billion. Stump said most of the A$196 million reduction in sales came from a A$155 million drop in copper and A$41 million in zinc. \n",
      " He said prices are now recovering and \"we've come out into the second half of this year in a much stronger position.\" \n",
      " Will Corkill, an analyst at Macquarie Equities in Sydney, said the operating result was \"what we expected.\" \n",
      " The A$2.2 million one-time loss reflected several write-downs, including A$121.4 million on development costs at two mines, offset mainly by a A$127.3 million write-back of deferred tax provisions. \n",
      " M.I.M. wrote down all A$63.4 million in \"capitalized pre-production costs\" at its A$250-million McArthur River lead, silver and zinc mine in the Northern Territory, about half-way between Mount Isa and Darwin. \n",
      " The mine, opened in September 1995, hasn't reached its planned capacity of 1.5 million metric tons a year. It was expected to produce 160,000 metric tons of zinc and 45,000 metric tons of lead in concentrates and 1.6 million ounces of silver a year. \n",
      " The company also wrote down A$58 million of \"obsolete\" assets at its Hilton lead-zinc mine, about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa in northwest Queensland state. \n",
      " \"We expected McArthur River and Hilton to be written down,\" said Corkill. \"Clearly this result shows that M.I.M. has accepted that McArthur River is a very disappointing asset and that Hilton is the same.\" \n",
      " Corkill said there were some \"encouraging\" signs emerging at M.I.M.'s core Mount Isa operations, particularly in the higher volumes of copper, lead and zinc produced. \n",
      " Copper production at Mount Isa was 46,342 metric tons in the three months to Dec. 31, up 52 percent compared with 30,566 metric tons in the corresponding period a year earlier. Copper tonnage was up 31 percent to 51,190 at M.I.M.'s Townsville refinery. \n",
      " Lead production at Mount Isa was 40,500 metric tons, compared with 33,240 metric tons. Mount Isa zinc production was down marginally to 47,050 metric tons in the December quarter, from 50,684, while total M.I.M. zinc production increased in the period. \n",
      " Phil Wright, executive general manager at Mount Isa, said production costs had been reduced for all metals produced there. \n",

      "Davis, who is such a micro-manager that he admits he was diagramming plays in the press box during the Raiders' Monday night defeat in Denver three weeks ago, made a rare media appearance to put a happy face on the marketing debacle that has characterized the Raiders' ticket sales this year. \n",
      " Davis did his best, but for someone who does not suffer fools gladly, it was clearly a strain. Asked if, in retrospect, the personal seat license prices were too high, Davis tap-danced nimbly before standing tepidly behind the price structure. \n",
      " \"There were certain economics,\" he said. \"The pricing was made. I've never been any place where the price wasn't too high. We made a stand. We're going to get it done.\" \n",
      " They may get it done, but Davis was in no mood to dwell on the series of foul-ups. Now that the new marketing group has finally shown signs of gaining back the trust of the fans, it announced yesterday that PSL holders will get first crack at extra tickets for the big game with Dallas on November 19. That news is sure to re-ignite angry fans who see the arrangement as PSL blackmail _ you have to buy a PSL to see the Dallas game. \n",
      " Asked about the new scheme, Davis made a brief stab at pulling an oar on the SS Oakland. \n",
      " \"Whatever you do you are going to get phone calls,\" he began. \"They (the City of Oakland, Alameda County and the Coliseum) want to be at a certain point economically.\" \n",
      " At that point, clearly lacking enthusiasm for playing defense, he went for the bomb, spotting Coliseum board member Ed De Silva wide open in the seat next to him. \n",
      " \"Ed,\" Davis said. \"You answer that.\" \n",
      " De Silva fielded the ball, but it is no fun to make that kind of catch in traffic. The only good news is that virtually everything that could go wrong has already done so. \n",
      " \"I can't tell you the amount of confusion,\" Davis complained at one point. \"First, (the stadium) was sold out. Then it wasn't.\" \n",
      " An encouraging sign is that the powers that be are no longer attempting to stonewall the problems. The strategy of last resort is to smile sheepishly and say, \"Wow, was this thing screwed up or what?\" Yesterday, De Silva admitted the tickets \"probably\" were too expensive. \n",
      " That's a huge improvement on the original approach, which was to smugly predict year-long sellouts, cash surpluses and an economic bonanza. TV blackouts of two home games have gotten the attention of the Oakland big wigs, who are feeling the heat from predictions that their rosy economic projections may fall short. \n",
      " That's where Davis comes in. Frankly, he doesn't care if they sell the tickets one at a time or give them away with a Bay Bridge toll. He isn't trying to sell PSLs, he just wants his money _ which is guaranteed _ and a full house for every home game. \n",
      " \"That's the problem,\" Davis said. \"But I'm willing to accept their problem because they are footing the bill.\" \n",
      " On the other hand, the folks marketing the Raiders tickets need Davis, because their credibility hit ground-zero when the last two home games were blacked out, including the one against the up-and-coming Colts. They now find themselves in the maddening position of announcing major improvements in the program and finding that no one believes a word they say. \n",
      " Poor Ezra Rapport, who left his job as deputy city manager to assume the thankless title of marketing director for the Oakland Football Marketing Association, can't get anyone to listen. \n",
      " Rapport has Nielsen numbers that show that the Raider telecasts are roughly within 6.0 rating points of the 49ers' games, and he notes that three of the four home games have been sellouts at kickoff (Seattle was 4,000 fans short). He tells everyone that some 37,000 PSLs have already been sold and the group's new financing plan is averaging about 100 new signups a day. \n",
      " But in a moment that captured the mood perfectly, Rapport was running through his list of positive marketing signs the other day on KNBR-AM when always-volatile talk-show host Ralph Barbieri accused him of being an apologist for the messed-up plan and hung up on him in mid-interview. \n",
      " The truth is, matters are improving. Ticket sales are up, and so are the Raiders. At least three of the four remaining home games _ Dallas, Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Denver _ should sell out. \n",
      " At the risk of getting hung up on, I predict the worst has passed. With a year to market the renovated stadium, and the Raiders coming off a playoff appearance, by next year we will see this for what it was, a slap-dash effort caused by trying to do too much in too little time. \n",
      " At which point, expect Al Davis to step up and accept the credit for turning a bad situation around. That's a role he's comfortable with. Just ask him about this year's team. \n"

      " Dad set off on his chore and just as he came to the hill above the house, he suddenly remembered it was April Fool's Day. Inspired, he jumped off Old Bird, gave her a good slap on the rump and she and the other horses galloped toward the corral by the house. Topping the hill where he could be seen by his parents, my father began limping horribly _ as if he'd been thrown by Old Bird. \n",
      " Suddenly there was a great commotion down by the house. His mother ran to open the gate to let the horses into the corral and his dad jumped in their '36 Chevy to race to help his injured son. Dad says he remembered thinking, \"Why, they do love me after all.\" \n",
      " Proud that his trick had worked so well, Dad looked up to see that the horses weren't heading for the corral at all. Instead, they were galloping straight for the open cornfield. If the horses got in there, they'd be days getting them out and there would be heck to pay. \n",
      " Forgetting his fake limp, Dad tore off lickety-split, running full out to head off the horses. Amazingly, he did it, and as they all gathered at the corral, the gate safely shut behind the horses, Dad turned toward his parents, smiling from ear to ear, and shouted \"April Fool's!\" \n",
      " His memory gets a little vague at this point. He usually mutters something about \"blamed old folks having no sense of humor\" and \"the woodshed.\" \n",
      " All I can say is, my sympathies are firmly with my grandparents. \n",

      "To this day, the winnowing process from his own youth still gnaws at him: how he was able to make it, while so many equally intelligent peers who grew up in less nurturing environments could not. \n",
      " That memory informed the educational model that made James Comer one of the most celebrated school innovators of his time: his approach begins and ends with the notion that, rather than intelligence and will, the experiences children have growing up, good and bad, determine who wins and loses in school and life. \n",
      " In many ways, this should be James Comer's moment, with education near the top of the national agenda and a White House passionately committed to his view of it. He is a hero to many education advocates, not the least of them Hillary Rodham Clinton, who introduced him at a recent tribute and symposium at the Yale Medical School. \n",
      " They were there to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his School Development Program, a nonprofit project of the Child Study Center at the Yale Medical School that advises schools on the use of his theories. \n",
      " But at 63, Comer (pronounced KOH-mer) finds himself not so much a symbol of how education has changed as a marker of where the fault lines are drawn. He is one of the most consistent critics of the ascendant countermodels for school reform: tougher standards, high-stakes tests and experiments with privatization or vouchers. \n",
      " For all the success of his approach, which is used in more than 450 schools in 17 states and several foreign countries, Comer is at least as aware of the winds blowing away from him as the ones wafting in his direction. \n",
      " \"In many ways, my voice has been heard, and I have had some influence,\" he said, reflecting on his career at his office at the Yale Medical School, where he is associate dean and a professor of child psychiatry. \"But in the one area that's most critical, the role of child development, people are still not paying attention. Our moment is going to come, but right now most of the attention seems to be on things like charters and vouchers that don't do anything for the vast majority of children.\" \n",
      " Few educators have looked so hard and long at how children's lives relate to educational achievement. \n",
      " \"Before it was a major field of study, Dr. Comer recognized that learning in school, before school and after school is tied to a child's level of development,\" Mrs. Clinton said in her introductory remarks. \"Before charter schools or magnet schools became household words, Dr. Comer was busy designing schools in which parents were involved in everything from curricular development to social activities.\" \n",
      " Comer's education model centers on the idea that many children, minority-group children in particular, struggle in school because their level of social, intellectual and cultural development is far behind that of more affluent students. \n",
      " Schools, he says, have to focus on the developmental needs of children, or even the best teachers and most sophisticated curriculum will not be effective. That means bringing counselors, psychologists, parents and others into the learning process _ rather than just depending on teachers _ and tailoring lessons to a child's background. \n",
      " For example, at Isadore Wexler Community School in inner-city New Haven, one school Comer works with, Shelia Brantley incorporates child development into her third-grade reading curriculum. Thus, the program is not just about reading. It might include a trip to the supermarket so students who have never seen an avocado can learn what the word means, a lesson suburban children might not need. \n",
      " Discussions are predicated on the children's learning to communicate complex thoughts and ideas they might not be exposed to at home. And the whole teaching and learning experience is based on social skills _ listening, sharing information, expressing clear points of view _ that transcend the individual lesson. \n",
      " The schools Comer works with are organized around three principles: problem solving rather than blaming; consensus decision-making, and collaboration. \n",
      " Much of it sounds uncontroversial. But Comer's program begins with the unfashionable idea that in a country of growing disparities between the haves and have nots, education has to begin by addressing the disparate needs and backgrounds of children so they can learn. \n",
      " \"Even my friends in education still begin by talking curriculum and instruction,\" he said. \"All those things are important, but where's the kid? What's the kid like? What's going on with the kid? All of American education has left the development of the child out of it. We may pay it lip service, but for a whole number of reasons, the needs of the kid get ignored.\" \n",
      " His perspective in many ways goes against the ingrained American belief that each individual can determine his or her own destiny. \n",
      " \"My biggest problem with education is we see learning as a function of intelligence and will,\" he said. \"If you have the intelligence and will, you will learn. If you don't, you won't. Well, it's not that simple.\" \n",
      " To critics, particularly advocates of vouchers, charter schools and tougher standards and tests, Comer's agenda, while well meaning, is not systematic enough to create real change in schools. \n",
      " \"He has a soft kind of model that's very Clintonesque,\" said Chester Finn, a prominent education analyst and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. \"It says things a lot of educators find appealing, but I'm not persuaded that it can be counted on to produce improved student achievement. It doesn't change the power. It doesn't change the control of resources. \n",

      "As if last week's sweep in Atlanta wasn't bad enough, the Braves have found new ways to crush Mets hearts. \n",
      " After blowing them out Tuesday night and teasing them by taking a beating on Wednesday, the Braves came back to take this series Thursday night with a 4-3 win in 11 innings. \n",
      " The Braves walked out of Shea Stadium with homefield advantage for the next two rounds of the playoffs while the Mets, who have now lost eight of their last nine, may have kissed the postseason goodbye. \n",
      " In case some of the formerly frenzied Mets fans didn't quite get it _ that their team is two down in the wild-card race with three games to go _ their favorite Brave issued a few parting words on his way off the field. \n",
      " \"I told them they could all go home and put their Yankee stuff on,\" said Chipper Jones, hero of last week's series in Atlanta and villain on Thursday night with an RBI single in the eighth. \"We came in to win two out of three. Mission accomplished.\" \n",
      " The Braves tantalized the Mets and their 48,364 fans by allowing them back from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits, one on a couple runs off Kevin Millwood and the other on a home run off Mike Remlinger, but the Braves kept coming. \n",
      " Brian Jordan silenced the crowd with a triple off Octavio Dotel to lead off the 11th inning as he wrong-footed Shawn Duston in right field. After an intentional walk to Andruw Jones, Ozzie Guillen drove Jordan for the winning run with a sacrifice fly to center field. \n",
      " For the third time on a six-game road trip, Guillen played the hero after beating the Expos with a 10th inning home run on Friday night and again Saturday with a two-run RBI single. This one brought the Braves their 17th extra inning win of the year, while the Mets stuck on five. \n",
      " \"I'm not going to panic,\" Guillen said. \"I know what I can do ... I've hit the ball in the clutch all my career. I'm not saying I'm the best clutch hitter, but I like to do it.\" \n",
      " The Braves won their fifth consecutive series against the Mets dating back through that sweep in the last three games of last season in Atlanta, which knocked the Mets out of last year's wild-card race. \n",
      " The Mets had wriggled out of a bases loaded jam that Jones helped create in the eighth when Pat Mahomes came on to retire Andruw Jones on a double play and Guillen on a flyout. Edgardo Alfonzo then took Remlinger deep for his 26th home run of the season to tie it 3-3. But that would be the last Mets hit of the night. \n",
      " \"If anything, this game was symbolic of why we're where we are,\" Remlinger said. \"That's typical of what we've done all year, find a way to hang on. It's not the way you'd draw it up, but it gets it done.\" \n",

      " Tuesday night was supposed to introduce a new era for the New Jersey Nets. They waited until two minutes were left to show their promise and boundless energy. The Nets scrambled to get within two points, but their enthusiasm was not enough as they lost the season opener for the third straight year, this time to the Cleveland Cavaliers, 86-82, in Continental Arena. \n",
      " Kenyon Martin, the No. 1 draft pick, shot 4 of 16, scored 10 points and pulled down seven rebounds for the Nets but fouled out with 38 seconds left. Kendall Gill, the shooting guard who shot 62 percent in the preseason, finished an abysmal 1 for 10. Point guard Stephon Marbury, despite his nine assists and six rebounds, shot 3 for 17. The Nets, who shot 46.3 percent in the preseason, plummeted to 36.5 percent shooting Tuesday night, nullifying their defensive effort. \n",
      " When the 10th-year veteran Bimbo Coles sank a 3-pointer for the Cavs with 4 minutes 43 seconds left, Marbury threw his head back in disbelief and frustration; the Cavs had taken a 74-67 lead. \n",
      " But the Nets clawed back, as Stephen Jackson, the rookie small forward who was unknown to Scott before the season, sank back-to-back 3-pointers in the final two minutes, to make it 82-80 with 55 seconds to play. Lamond Murray drove to the basket for Cleveland with 38 seconds remaining, drawing the foul from Martin. \n",
      " Aaron Williams, a 6-foot-9-inch power forward, showed why he may have been the Nets' best free-agent acquisition. Coming off the bench, he kept the Nets in the game in the second half, springing for rebounds and flying in for four dunks and 16 second-half points and a game-high 20 points. With 30.7 seconds remaining, he made two foul shots to bring the Nets to 84-82. \n",

      " The senior ladies of Beardstown, Ill., who got into trouble for miscalculating their published investment club returns, nevertheless have this wise advice: Pay more attention to things that will yield greater savings. \n",
      " Many people spend hours clipping coupons to save on their grocery bill. But they often don't spend enough time shopping around for auto or homeowners insurance, which will yield bigger savings. People may drive an extra mile to get soda a few cents cheaper, but they think nothing of buying extended warranties that cost a lot and often are unnecessary. \n",
      " As such, most of this year's tips focus on cutting the big bills in your life: \n",
      " 1. Make an extra payment a year on your mortgage. On a $50,000 mortgage of 30 years at 8 percent, the monthly payment would be $366.88. If you increase your monthly payment to $370, just paying $3.12 extra, it would reduce your loan repayment period by a year. Paying biweekly is an option too, but some lenders will charge you for switching schedules. \n",
      " 2. Lower your homeowners insurance premium by buying auto or life insurance from the same company. By not smoking, installing smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, fire-resistant doors and a security alarm system, you could also get a discount. Raising your deductible also works. Some insurers give breaks to people over 50 or retirees and longtime customers. \n",
      " 3. Consider disability insurance. In a Cheapskate Monthly survey, 2,000 seriously ill people with medical insurance still lost everything they owned because of the resulting disability. Half of mortgage foreclosures are a result of disability, far more than death. \n",
      " 4. Don't automatically buy a more popular name-brand appliance, which will cost more. General Electric also makes Gibson, Kelvinator, Tappan and White Westinghouse. Maytag also makes Admiral, Hardwick, Magic Chef, Jenn-Air, Montgomery Ward and Norge. Whirlpool also makes KitchenAid, Roper and Estate. Sears' appliances are made by GE, Whirlpool and others. \n",
      " 5. Buy energy-efficient appliances. For example, gas ranges with an automatic spark ignition system are 30 percent more efficient than ones with pilot lights. But skip the extended warranties. \n",
      " 6. Wash clothes with cold water. It doesn't make a difference and saves on heating. \n",
      " 7. Lower the temperature on your water heater to 125 degrees from 140 degrees. The water will still be hot enough and you'll save up to 10 percent on heating. \n",
      " 8. Insulate your home properly to retain heat. Shade your home to keep it cool and save on air-conditioning costs. \n",
      " 9. Buy a slightly used car. New cars depreciate 20 percent after purchase. \n",
      " 10. Drive cars longer. Maintain them well. \n",
      " 11. Don't borrow money to make your life just slightly better, such as going into debt to buy nice clothes and shoes. \n",
      " 12. Tap your home equity loan. The interest rate will be cheaper than those offered by your credit cards. You can also deduct the interest from your taxes. \n",
      " 13. Contribute to a tax-deferred retirement plan such as a 401(k) or IRA. \n",
      " 14. Get a credit card that gives rebates, airline miles or other perks. \n",
      " 15. Travel in the off-season. \n",
      " 16. Instead of eating dinner out with friends, try for dessert. \n",
      " 17. Skip fads and fashions. They usually cost more. \n",
      " 18. Save your coins. After a year, it could add up to hundreds or thousands of dollars. \n",
      " 19. Go to afternoon movie matinees and save one-third of the ticket cost. \n",
      " 20. Buy in bulk, especially medicine such as aspirin. Buy generic brands. \n"

      "The business merger between baseball's New York Yankees and basketball's New Jersey Nets overcame its final obstacle Tuesday when Major League Baseball owners approved the deal in Irving, Texas. \n",
      " The Yankees-Nets merger was announced last February after Cablevision's proposed acquisition of 70 percent of the Yankees fell apart. \n",
      " Baseball's ratification of the deal came 10 weeks after the National Basketball Association approved it. \n",

      " \"The resulting company, YankeeNets, intends to become a significant sports and entertainment entity,\" said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Steinbrenner and a board member of the holding company. \n",
      " Initially, Steinbrenner believed the merger did not constitute a change in control of the Yankees and did not require a vote. But baseball's position prevailed and it approved the transfer of shares. \n",
      " Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for baseball, said the paperwork for the deal was not ready in time for the last ownership meeting in September. No meeting was scheduled during the playoffs. \n",
      " \"There really weren't any hang-ups,\" Courtney said. \n",
      " To create the merged company, the Yankees were valued at $600 million and the Nets at $150 million. To equalize the ownership, the Nets paid the Yankees $225 million. \n",
      " The combined holding company is trying to sell $360 million in bonds to finance the merger, $115 million of which would finance the Nets' payment to the Yankees, according to The Sports Business Journal, an industry weekly. Another $115 million will be used to pay the Nets' existing debt, the publication reported. \n",
      " Steinbrenner has said he needed baseball's approval before making his long-awaited decision to stay in the Bronx or move to Manhattan after his Yankee Stadium lease expires after the 2002 season. \n",

      " Clark had sought a delay until Friday as a minimum sanction. As a maximum penalty, Clark asked Ito to halt Lopez' testimony until the defense begins its portion of the sensational double-murder case. \n",
      " Ito could impose additional sanctions this afternoon when he listens to discovery motions. \n",
      " But Ito's response Tuesday to the defense transgression prompted legal experts to wonder whether the judge is sending a stern enough message to bring attorneys in line. \n",
      " \"It's sort of like a parking ticket,\" said Harland Braun, a defense attorney and former prosecutor. \"If the parking ticket is $18 and the lot is $12 you take the chance.\" \n",
      " Former District Attorney Ira Reiner said the attorneys will continue to take advantage of the situation if Ito doesn't put his foot down. \n",
      " \"The defense is paying no price for it,\" Reiner said. \"There are no consequences.\" \n",
      " At issue was a tape recorded interview of Lopez taken in July that defense attorney Carl Douglas denied existed until one of his own investigators William Pavelic admitted in open court Monday that he had a tape. \n",
      " Clark said the defense tactics have placed the prosecution \"behind the eight ball.\" \n",
      " \"In other words, you feel as if you've been sandbagged again?\" Ito asked. \n",
      " \"Well, we have,\" Clark replied. \n",
      " In the first week of Simpson's trial, the defense withheld statements from 14 witnesses until after prosecutors delivered their opening statements. \n",
      " That prompted prosecutors to accuse the defense of trying the case by ambush. \n",
      " As a sanction, Ito allowed the prosecution an unprecedented opportunity to add to their opening statements before calling the first witnesses. He also delivered a harsh admonition to the defense, but the jury heard a toned-down version of his concerns that most experts believed had no effect. \n",
      " Robert Pugsley, a professor at Southwestern University School of Law, said the defense team's earlier failure to disclose information pales in comparison to the Lopez tape. \n",
      " \"This is way more egregious,\" he said. \"Even if it was negligence, it's still an outrageous violation of the reciprocal discovery law.\" \n",
      " Clark said the 15-minute tape turned over to prosecutors Tuesday includes numerous contradictory statements and could provide prosecutors ammunition to discredit Lopez's testimony. \n",
      " Lopez said Monday she saw Simpson's Bronco parked outside his Rockingham Avenue estate at about the time prosecutors contend that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were slain. \n",
      " University of Southern California law professor Erwin Chemerinsky said that with a full day of court proceedings scheduled for today, prosecutors will have little time to do the necessary leg work. \n",
      " \"Delaying cross examination by one day isn't even a slap on the wrist for the defense,\" Chemerinsky said. \"Making the defense pay her hotel bills isn't even slap on the wrist.\" \n",
      " Attorney Leo Terrell said that both sides have been guilty of delays in producing evidence in the Simpson case. But Terrell said that Ito has to be careful about sanctioning the defense if it affects the defendant's right to a fair trial. \n",
      " \"He can punish the attorneys, but he can't punish O.J. Simpson,\" Terrell said. \n",

      "City Council members have authorized Mayor Richard Riordan to retain an outside attorney to advise him on upholding or overturning the Police Commission's reprimand of Chief Willie L. Williams. \n",
      " Lacking the 10 votes to overturn the commission's action by a June 7 deadline, council members said Wednesday that they were willing to authorize the contract with former city attorney Burt Pines to help Riordan evaluate the reprimand. \n",
      " Pines was brought in because the City Attorney's Office, which normally would advise the mayor, faces a conflict of interest stemming from its representation of Williams in several other civil suits, city officials said. \n",
      " Sources said commissioners issued the reprimand because Williams lied to them about accepting free lodgings from Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas. \n",
      " Williams has denied the allegation and has threatened to sue the city. \n",
      " City officials said Pines volunteered to advise the mayor for free on the issues involved, but will be paid if the case goes to litigation. \n",
      " Also Wednesday, Mark Ridley-Thomas and Marvin Braude submitted a council motion calling for the City Attorney's Office to conduct a preliminary investigation to determine if officers with the departments' Organized Crime Intelligence Division conducted an unauthorized investigation into Williams' visits to Las Vegas. \n",
      " Citing news reports, the two members of the council's Public Safety Committee said the City Attorney's Office should report directly to the council not only on possible unauthorized investigations but also on the leak of information involving the Police Commission's own investigation of Williams. \n",
      " Police Commissioners confirmed Wednesday that the panel sent a memo last Friday to Williams asking him for a report on whether OCID or any other police agency has engaged in unauthorized investigations of public figures, including the chief, the mayor, the commissioners and City Council members. \n",
      " Commission Vice President Deirdre Hill, who authored the memo, said it was in response to rampant rumors of police spying on public officials, none of which she said has been substantiated. \n",
      " The memo asks Williams to review whether any police computers have been used to access confidential information on public officials, Hill said. \n",
      " \"I don't expect they will find any wrongdoing or skullduggery,\" said LAPD Cmdr. Tim McBride regarding the review requested by the Police Commission last week. \n",
      " Riordan could not be reached for comment, but publicly has praised the commission since its decision to reprimand Williams and some City Hall officials say privately they would be surprised if he overturns its action. \n",
      " If Riordan affirms the reprimand, it would set the stage for Williams to appeal it to the City Council. If the council still couldn't muster the 10 votes to overturn the reprimand, Williams could pursue his appeal through the courts, officials say. \n",
      " Regarding rumors of police spying, police officials on Wednesday continued to dispute a report in the current issue of Newsweek that members of the Organized Crime Intelligence Division conducted an unauthorized investigation of the chief and leaked the information to discredit Williams. \n",
      " That report prompted Ridley-Thomas and Braude to request an inquiry into whether illegal spying was undertaken against the chief. \n",
      " On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Daily News reported that Las Vegas intelligence detectives were contacted Jan. 6 by an LAPD detective from OCID who asked whether Williams had been in Las Vegas the previous October. \n",
      " McBride said there was no misconduct involved because the communication between detectives was casual conversation, not part of an official investigation. \n",
      " But Ridley-Thomas said the phone call to Las Vegas by an OCID detective seeking information on Williams is cause for concern. \n"

      "SYDNEY, Australia Someone defected Saturday night at Olympic Stadium. \n",
      " It happened right after the men's 400-meter relay final, right there in the stands. Watching the victorious U.S. squad of Jon Drummond, Bernard Williams, Brian Lewis and Maurice Greene wear Old Glory as a turban, wear their immaturity on their sleeves, wear out the infinite patience of the Games' Australian hosts, I decided I could no longer in good conscience let them represent me. \n",
      " So I defected. I threw a blue fleece with AUS on the back over my USA T-shirt. Australia, you see, does more than juxtapose the same three letters nonsimilarly, it has its priorities in a different order, too. \n",
      " Grace and modesty matter here. They will tolerate arrogance but never admire it. \n",
      " Drummond, Williams, Lewis and Greene might have picked up a few slang expressions in their three weeks here but obviously none of the Aussies' manners rubbed off on them. After repelling the challenge of Brazil and Cuba, the American foursome made a mockery of the victory lap. \n",
      " Williams couldn't go three steps without stopping to strike a comic pose for the camera; Lord knows his eyebrows had more arch than his feet. \n",
      " Greene kept stopping to cup his ears, as if to let the Olympic Stadium sellout crowd know it wasn't loving him enough. \n",
      " Lewis wrapped an American flag around his head and imperiously made his way around the track like a sheik coming around to be adored by his subjects. \n",
      " Drummond tried to drum up chants of \"U-S-A\" from a decorous Australian crowd that was rendered speechless by what it was witnessing. \n",
      " Watching the scene unfold, I felt the same annoyance as when a linebacker makes a tackle and then breaks into a dance over his victim. I wanted to scream, \"Act like you've been there before.\" \n",
      " Shedding emotions is a lot like shedding clothing; there's a time and a place to let your exuberance all hang out. On the world's stage, in front of a television audience in the billions, is not it. \n",
      " As irony would have it, Henry Kissenger was enlisted to hand out the medals in the men's sprint relay. I'm quite sure Kissenger didn't see this much posturing in all his diplomatic dealings with Communist leaders in the 1970s. \n",
      " As the national anthem played on, the Americans took the medals the former U.S. Secretary of State had just draped around their necks and bounced them off their foreheads (Lewis), raised them to their eye like a monocle (Williams) and posed for posterity (Williams, Greene and Drummond). \n",
      " Star-spangled blemish? \n",
      " Nanceen Perry, a member of the U.S. sprint relay team that won the bronze medal, thought so. She said she and relay mates Chryste Gaines and Torri Edwards watched the men's medal ceremony and \"were kind of ashamed.\" \n",
      " Greene and Co. clearly got so caught up in the moment, they forgot they weren't pro wrestlers acting in their own narrow self-interest but athletes representing the United States of America. \n",
      " \"How do you expect anybody to respect our flag if you don't respect our flag?\" Perry said. \"I think foreigners think (Americans) are rude, anyway. It just kind of confirms the whole image the world has of us.\" \n",
      " Most young men and women who wear USA on their backs understand they are diplomats in track suits. \n",
      " \"We come to this competition to represent the USA proudly,\" said Antonio Pettigrew, a member of the victorious U.S. 1,600 relay. \"It's more of a spectrum than just what's here. It's for all the world to see.\" \n",
      " It's a good thing the world wasn't privy to the American sprinters' antics in their post-ceremony press conference. Williams stood on a chair behind the dais and what else? posed. All four broke into a silly song. \n",
      " At length the Americans were joined by the Cuban team and one of its sprinters was asked a question. While the question was being translated and the Cuban was answering in his native tongue, Williams made noises into his microphone as though he were laying down a bass-heavy track and Lewis rocked back and forth in his chair as if the earphones he was wearing were channeling music instead of the English translations of the Cuban's musings. \n",
      " When a U.S. reporter called them out on their behavior on the awards podium, Greene and Drummond at first tried to turn it into one more comedic sound byte. When he realized his bombastic act was falling flat, Greene seemed genuinely stricken. \n",
      " For the past four years he and Drummond have been the ringleaders of a circus pitched by Emanuel Hudson and UCLA coach John Smith with an eye toward drawing more attention to track and more corporate interest in its stars. \n",
      " Sometime during the contentious question-and-answer session, it seemed to dawn on Greene that in their drive to become American icons, he and his teammates had come off looking like idiots. \n",
      " By the time he left the podium, all the hot air had left Greene. He looked as deflated as a punctured balloon. \n",
      " \"I don't think we offended anybody by our actions,\" he said. \"If (people) were offended, I'm sorry.\" \n",

      "Chris Chandler's dream week ended with a rude awakening on Sunday night. \n",
      " During the week leading to this Super Bowl, the Atlanta Falcons' veteran found a number of people comparing him favorably to the opposing quarterback, a probable Hall of Famer named John Elway. \n",
      " After all, Chandler's supporters said, he had a higher passing efficiency rating this season than Elway, had career-bests in yardage and touchdowns and threw just 12 interceptions. \n",
      " Sunday night was a starkly different story, though, as the Broncos largely muted Atlanta's offense in a 34-19 victory at Pro Player Stadium. \n",
      " The Broncos swarmed Chandler (19 of 35 for 219 yards) with a high-leaping pass rush, sacking him twice and forcing three interceptions. \n",
      " Chandler did provide Atlanta's only offensive touchdown _ a 3-yard pass to wide receiver Terance Mathis with 2 minutes 4 seconds left _ but by then, the winner of this game had been assured. \n",
      " Two plays haunted Chandler as he addressed the news media afterward. \n",
      " The first came midway through the third quarter, with Denver leading by 17-6 and Atlanta 21 yards away from the end zone. His pass for Mathis was deflected by defensive tackle Keith Traylor and intercepted by cornerback Darrien Gordon, who streaked to the Atlanta 21. It led to a Broncos touchdown. \n",
      " \"Their cornerbacks sink to the middle on coverage and all I have to do is throw it over their head on a sideline pattern,\" Chandler said. \"This one would have been just another one of those, except it was deflected.\" \n",
      " The second nightmare came several minutes later, with Atlanta still trying to make a game of it. From the Denver 26, Chandler aimed for wide receiver Tony Martin and Gordon again made the interception. \n",
      " \"That was 100 percent missed communication,\" Chandler said. \"He decided at the last second to go over the top and I thought he was going to run a sharper, flatter pattern. The only guy who was right was Gordon.\" \n",
      " The quarterback who has found a home finally with his sixth National Football League team then paused, not wanting to sound too much like a whining loser. \n",
      " \"I could tell you all kinds of things that happened in this game,\" he said, \"but they would sound like excuse making. And that's not really an important thing to me.\" \n",
      " Greg Robinson, the Denver defensive coordinator, said his unit used 10 types of pressure schemes on Chandler. \n",
      " \"We couldn't let him get comfortable,\" he said. \"We were keeping our distance on a lot of coverages, because we didn't want him to beat us deep. But I think we affected his timing with our pressure.\" \n",
      " Indeed, the Denver defense allowed only two touchdowns in three post-season games. Though Chandler was responsible for one of them, he said: \"It got pretty frustrating out there. We were getting close, but they were tough in the red zone.\" \n",
      " The Falcons tried to establish some semblance of a running attack early in the game. Chandler attempted just three passes in the first quarter, and his lone completion gained only 4 yards. \n",
      " In two series that bridged the first and second quarters, the quarterback threw one pass, and it was incomplete. \n",
      " He finally came out throwing on Atlanta's fourth drive _ completing three passes in a row for 55 yards _ but as the Falcons drew closer to Denver's goal line, they returned mostly to the run. \n",
      " Three straight Jamal Anderson runs put them at the Broncos' 8-yard line. A long commercial timeout interrupted play at this point, and Chandler's wild pass afterward made it look as if his timing had been affected. \n",
      " That left it to normally reliable Morten Andersen to get something out of the drive. But his 26-yard field goal attempt was wide right. \n",
      " In a way that described Atlanta's offense on this night, too. \n",
      " Chandler is mindful that the next Super Bowl is in Atlanta. \n",
      " \"I just have to look forward to doing this again, back at our place,\" he said. \n"

      "As a native of Philadelphia, the town of brotherly hate where fans have booed Santa Claus, Mike Schmidt and Julius Erving, Frank Costa should have been prepared. \n",
      " He wasn't. \n",
      " Costa is the senior quarterback for the University of Miami (Fla.). That is the position of pedigree on a team that is famous for national championships and winning quarterbacks. During the past two seasons, Costa has struggled to measure himself against the Hurricanes' Heroes. \n",
      " He has been benched (last season), booed (last season), blasted (by the media) and battered (by opponents' pass rushes). When Costa leads the third-ranked Hurricanes against top-ranked Nebraska in tonight's Orange Bowl, it will be his final chance to write his legacy at Miami. \n",
      " \"If I play well, people will applaud me. If I play bad, I'll get criticized,\" said the 6-foot-4, 215-pound Costa. \"I used to let little things bother me -- like what people said about me. I've gotten a lot more thick-skinned. \n",
      " \"In high school, I always got a lot of positive press and a lot of fan support. I had never been booed or ripped apart until I came down here. That's just part of being the quarterback down here.\" \n",
      " From Jim Kelly to Bernie Kosar to Vinnie Testaverde to Steve Walsh to Craig Erickson to Gino Torretta, the Miami quarterback torch has been passed. Along the way, there have been four national championships and two Heisman Trophy winners (Testaverde and Torretta). \n",
      " \"I'd love to be mentioned in the same breath with those guys,\" Costa said. \"If we beat Nebraska and I'm linked with those guys, great. If they don't, that's fine. That's something I can't control.\" \n",
      " When Costa's career ends tonight, his numbers will not match his predecessors. If the Hurricanes defeat Nebraska and Penn State loses to Oregon tomorrow in the Rose Bowl, Miami probably would have another championship. But that scenario is a long shot. \n",
      " But for Costa, his status as a starter in a game as important as the Orange Bowl is a significant accomplishment. \n",
      " \"He's come a long way,\" said Miami offensive coordinator Rich Olson. \"With all the criticism he's had to go through, he's made tremendous strides. He's had a great year. The last couple of days in practice, he's thrown it about as well as since he's been here.\" \n",
      " On Oct.9, 1993, Miami lost to eventual national champion Florida State, and Costa lost his starting job to Ryan Collins. That loss -- a Costa interception was returned for a key touchdown -- became Costa's crucible. \n",
      " \"I was very depressed after that game,\" he said. \"I used to get up in the middle of the night and just drive around. I couldn't eat, even though I tried. I lost 20 pounds in about three to four weeks.\" \n",
      " His teammates realized that Costa was in a personal hell. They tried to help him. \n",
      " \"I really can't imagine what he was going through,\" said sophomore center K.C. Jones of Midland Lee High School. \"He's a tough kid. He not only survived, but he thrived.\" \n",
      " But as he battled his demons and fought to regain his confidence, Costa said, he began to see himself in a different light. \n",
      " \"I grew up a lot after that game,\" he said. \"I went into that game as a 21-year-old kid. I came out of it as a 21-year-old man.\" \n",
      " Collins started the rest of the season and led the Hurricanes to a 9-2 regular season. During Miami's 29-0 shellacking by Arizona in the Fiesta Bowl, Costa played well in relief of Collins. Then, after the game, Costa asked to meet with Miami coach Dennis Erickson. \n",
      " \"I told him I felt like I got blamed for a lot of the stuff that happened last season,\" Costa said. \"I asked him to look me in the eye and tell me that I would have a fair chance to win the job back during spring practice. I figured if I couldn't do that, then I might transfer. When he said he would give me the chance, that gave me a new life here.\" \n",
      " Costa reclaimed his job when he outplayed Collins during spring practice. \n",
      " Then came a 38-20 loss to Washington on Sept.24 that ended the Hurricanes' NCAA-record 58-game home-field winning streak. The fans and critics focused on a Costa interception that led to a touchdown (the receiver slipped). With Florida State only two weeks away, could Costa win a big game? \n",
      " Against the Seminoles, Costa's numbers were not impressive. He completed 18 of 32 passes for 177 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions. But the statistics were overshadowed by Miami's 34-20 victory that served as the starting point to the team's eight-game winning streak. \n",
      " \"He executed the game plan, made some great throws, and he withstood their pressure,\" Olson said. \"The question was, could he win the big game? For a quarterback, being able to win the big game is what they live for. When he was able to win that game, that was a great weight off his shoulders. His confidence, he's just a different guy in practice.\" \n",
      " In the Hurricanes' final regular-season game against Boston College, Costa was sacked six times and knocked down a dozen more. A self-described pocket passer, Costa realizes that if he is going to complete passes, he has to hold on to the ball until the last minute. His toughness has earned his teammates' respect. \n",
      " \"He's taken an enormous number of shots,\" Jones said. \"There have been some games I'm surprised he's been able to walk out of the stadium.\" \n",
      " Costa was asked what advice he would give if asked by a high school quarterback prospect who was considering playing at Miami. \n",
      " \"If he wants to prepare himself for the NFL and to get the most out of himself as a quarterback, he should seriously consider coming here,\" Costa said. \"If he wants to live the college life, have a good time and start for three or four years, he shouldn't come here. Most of our quarterbacks start for two years. \n",
      " \"There's nothing wrong with being a quarterback here. It prepares you for anything. It prepares you for life.\": [8551, 8520, 7488]\n",

      "It was a little more than a month ago, but the Bruins could still feel the sting of blowing a two-goal lead in the third period of a 4-3 loss in New York. So when the Rangers came to town Saturday, Dec. 28 was still very fresh in the minds of Boston's players. \n",
      " \"That's what we said going into the third, `They stole one from us, let's get this,\"' said Jason Allison, who scored the Bruins' first goal. \"I think we deserved to win, we played well. We played pretty much 60 minutes, too.\" \n",
      " Indeed they did. Trailing, 2-1, heading into the final period, the Bruins erupted for three goals on the way to a 4-2 victory at the FleetCenter in front of a rare sellout crowd of 17,565. \n",
      " The Bruins are now three games over .500 (23-20-9) with four games remaining before the Olympic break. Coach Pat Burns said this was a game they had to have. \n",
      " \"This is important, we've got to get these games at home,\" said Burns, whose team will face the Islanders in Uniondale, N.Y., this afternoon. \"We played a lot of three-line hockey and four-defense hockey, but we can't let these points at home slip through our fingers because we know the ones on the road from here to the end of the year are going to be really, really tough.\" \n",
      " The Rangers are a team in crisis. On Friday, coach Colin Campbell began the workout at Northeastern with a 10-minute meeting (during which he questioned his players' commitment), and then he skated them into the ground. After a first period Thursday night against Ottawa in which the Rangers were outshot, 17-2, Campbell was furious. \n",
      " \"There were seven or eight guys who were downright awful,\" he said. \"It was a disgusting performance.\" \n",
      " Hence, the punishment duty. \n",
      " \"I've got to be a bad guy, every coach has got to be a bad guy,\" Campbell said after practice. \"At what point and time do you do it, and at what point in time do you lose your team? The question comes, are they not listening to me? Should I ask them what to do? Do we have to trade or waive three or four teammates to wake them up? \n",
      " The coach's message sank in for exactly one period as the Rangers built a 2-0 lead. Darren Langdon scored just 46 seconds in, and the visitors upped the advantage on the power play at 14:36. Brian Leetch, who was questionable up until game time because of a nerve problem in his right leg that was causing numbness and had forced him to miss two games, took a pass from Wayne Gretzky and blasted a one-timer from the left point that caromed off the skate of Bruins defenseman Don Sweeney and past goalie Byron Dafoe. \n",
      " The Bruins began the climb back with 21.5 seconds left on Allison's 19th goal, on the power play. After outshooting the Rangers, 12-5, in the middle period but not scoring, the Bruins turned up the heat in the third, scoring three goals, two of which were direct results of winning draws. \n",
      " Tim Taylor beat Gretzky on a faceoff in the left circle, got it back to Hal Gill, and the rookie defenseman scorched a shot past Richter for the 2-2 tie at the 32-second mark. Two other rookies combined on the winning goal at 5:35. After the Rangers turned the puck over, the Bruins took off on a two-on-one with Joe Thornton rushing up ice with Sergei Samsonov. With only Leetch back to defend, Thornton dished the puck from the right circle to Samsonov, who beat Richter with a one-timer. What made it more remarkable was that Thornton missed a good portion of the second period after taking a stick to the groin, which made breathing difficult for a time. \n",

      " The Kings, playing the team they could face in the first round of the playoffs, win the award for worst performance in more than a month by a leading team _ a 5-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues before a sellout crowd of 16,005 Saturday at the Forum. \n",
      " Two nagging problems the Kings had before their hot streak, they had Saturday. \n",
      " A propensity to take penalties: They had 13 for 29 minutes in a game marred by an inordinate number of calls, the product of the league's crackdown on obstruction. St. Louis, which was penalized 11 times for 33 minutes, scored three power-play goals _ all the Blues needed. \n",
      " An anemic power play: The Kings, who had three power-play goals in a 7-4 victory over Chicago on Thursday, went 0 for 5 with a man advantage against St. Louis. \n",
      " And, courtesy of coach Larry Robinson, half-hearted effort on the part of several players and uncharacteristic careless play sealed L.A.'s fate on a day they'd like to forget. \n",
      " With the loss, the fifth-place Kings (27-21-20) fell six points behind the fourth-place Blues (31-22-8) in the Western Conference, although the Kings have played three fewer games. \n",
      " With a victory, the difference would've been two points and home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs would've been more likely. \n",
      " Afterward, Robinson let two players have it: left wing Vladimir Tsyplakov and center Yanic Perreault. \n",
      " \"It was a huge game for us and we had three, four guys who didn't show up,\" Robinson said. \". . . Tsypy just wasn't getting the job done, he didn't want the puck. He was just not getting involved. . . . \n",
      " \"Yanic didn't do a thing all night. He's gotta come up big for us. We rely on him to score goals. He didn't have a good game.\" \n",
      " As Robinson said, it wasn't just Tsyplakov and Perreault. \n",
      " Goaltender Stephane Fiset, who has been as big a reason for the Kings' success as anyone, wasn't at his best. He did face 38 shots (to the Kings' 19) but seemed to be as off as his teammates. \n",
      " And other players made key mistakes that proved costly. \n",
      " The biggest letdown occurred after Glen Murray scored his 20th goal of the season to give the Kings a 2-1 lead and some momentum at 16:06 of the second period. \n",
      " Geoff Courtnall, the brother of the Kings' Russ Courtnall, was left open in front of the net and scored to make it 2-2 at 17:43. As Courtnall celebrated, L.A.'s Sean O'Donnell took a penalty by giving him a forearm to the mouth. \n",
      " Ten seconds later, at 17:53, a cross-the-crease pass by Pierre Turgeon ricocheted off the Kings' Rob Blake and into the net to make it 3-2. \n",
      " The Kings never recovered. \n",
      " \"We missed our assignment and, BANG!, it's in the net. We take a bad penalty, BANG!, two goals and there's your game,\" Robinson said. \n",
      " The defeat was particularly disappointing because the Kings had forgotten what it's like to lose. \n",
      " Entering the game, they were 4-0-1 in their past five and 10-1-2 in their past 13, the loss coming on Feb. 2 in Edmonton. No team in the league was hotter. \n",
      " Thus, they were abundantly confident going into Saturday, because of the success, the fact they were home, the fact St. Louis goalie Grant Fuhr was out with an injury. Indeed, it looked good for perhaps the most surprising team in the league. \n",
      " Instead, a chance to make a huge statement against a very good team _ the Kings haven't beaten a team with a record better than .500 since November _ was wasted. \n",
      " Fatigue might have played a role. \n",
      " The Kings were playing their third game in four days, the first two across the continent in Detroit and Chicago. \n",
      " However, they don't have time to be tired. They play 14 games in the next 30 days, all but one against teams in the Western Conference. \n",
      " How L.A. performs against Vancouver on Monday at the Forum could be telling. \n",
      " \"We've played very well lately,\" veteran center Ray Ferraro said. \"It wasn't the best game of the past month for sure. It's going to happen, though. You can't play perfect hockey. \n",
      " \"The trick is when you lose like this, you have to bounce back for the next game, not let the momentum slip away.\": [10285, 10270, 8817]\n",

      "The Los Angeles Dodgers say the frustration permeating the clubhouse these days is worse than that which gripped them a month ago during similarly trying times. \n",
      " It's later in the season, they're playing worse and after Saturday they no longer have to wonder how bad it would be if their pitching and defense collapsed like their offense. \n",
      " The Dodgers' 6-3 loss to the Cardinals, their fourth straight defeat and 10th in 13 games, featured a month's worth of lowlights. \n",
      " Four Dodgers errors. Two Cardinals doubles that were difficult but catchable fly balls. Two Dodgers runners caught between bases. Two Dodgers hits between the second and ninth innings. And afterward, a closed-door, closed-hallway meeting. \n",
      " \"Everything happened in the game today that could have happened,\" said Dodgers manager Bill Russell, who called the team meeting to let his players know what he thought of their play of late. \n",
      " Reporters were not only kept outside the door to the clubhouse but down a hall and beyond another door. The meeting lasted about 20 minutes. \n",
      " When he addressed the media, Russell looked no worse for wear than he has after any Dodgers loss. \n",
      " But this one was worse. \n",
      " \"Every aspect of the game,\" Russell said. \"It was a total breakdown.\" \n",
      " Thus, as they sit at .500 for the first time in more than a month, the Dodgers are confronting the question of whether they are playing badly or just plain bad. \n",
      " They can only hope that Saturday's game will be remembered as the end of the beginning and not the beginning of the end. \n",
      " \"It's going to have to stop,\" third baseman Todd Zeile said. \"I don't think Billy or the Dodgers or Mr. O'Malley or whoever owns the team is going to stand by and watch four more months of this.\" \n",
      " A 14-0 loss to Atlanta on April 28 was also the fourth in a string and dropped the Dodgers to 11-11. They promptly started a four-game winning streak, eventually rising seven games above .500. \n",
      " Following the Dodgers' second loss in that April streak, players called a closed-door meeting. After the loss in Atlanta, many on the team cut loose deep into the night and showed up at the park the next day feeling cleansed. \n",
      " Of the possibility that a similar turnaround might occur now, Zeile said, `It's a sad testament that we've got to have a rousing meeting to motivate the team.\" \n",
      " At the suggestion that the Dodgers' well-documented struggles at the plate have carried over to the field, first baseman Eric Karros said players \"at this level\" should be able to forget and separate those things. \n",
      " But the Dodgers are not doing that. \n",
      " \"We're playing like we're very inexperienced,\" Karros said. \"There's no excuse for making mental mistakes.\" \n",
      " The blunders that were made Saturday could make someone go mental. \n",
      " The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the second inning on a single by Zeile and a line-drive home run by Todd Hollandsworth, who entered the game in a 1-for-17 slump that included seven strikeouts in his past 10 at-bats. \n",
      " \"Hollandsworth, who hasn't been swinging the bat very well, hits a two-run homer,\" Russell said. \"You were looking for good things to happen. They didn't.\" \n",
      " Cardinals starter Todd Stottlemyre, who incidentally got the victory by becoming the third Cardinals pitcher in the series to make it to at least the eighth inning, got the first hit off Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes with two out in the third inning. Stottlemyre ended up at second when left fielder Eric Anthony's throw back to the infield went awry and scored on Delino DeShields' double. \n",
      " Ray Lankford led off the fourth with a shot to center field that Hollandsworth looked to have in his reach. He didn't, and Lankford was jogging as he approached second base. Lankford went to third on Willie McGee's single to left and scored on a bloop single by Gary Gaetti. \n",
      " In the meantime, the Dodgers had three base runners from the third inning to the seventh. One, Hollandsworth in the fifth inning, got caught stealing after a rundown between second and third. Another, Wilton Guerrero in the sixth, got picked off first. \n",
      " Still, the game was tied 2-2. Not for long. \n",
      " The Cardinals scored four runs in the bottom of the sixth on a single, a double, a home run and two Dodgers errors. \n",
      " Many Dodgers wondered aloud what the media was looking for. It's the same old thing, quite a few players said: \n"

      "LOS ANGELES  Though a good chunk of his life was spent building it, Andy Luna never had seen the Getty Center looking quite so stylish before. \n",
      " For 6 1/2 years, the construction foreman had labored on the new Getty Museum and its five affiliated institutes _ collectively, the world's richest arts complex. \n",
      " When he started on the project, Luna said, the Brentwood construction site was \"just a hill,\" a 110-acre slice of the Santa Monica Mountains bereft of buildings, artworks or identity. \n",
      " This past weekend, Luna and his wife Rosalie were among some 5,000 construction workers and their families invited to tour the sprawling marble-and-metal complex, in what the Getty had billed as a celebration of the workers' skill and sweat equity. For Luna and his colleagues, many of them employees of L.A.-based Dinwiddie Construction Co., it was an occasion of proud camaraderie and quiet contemplation. \n",
      " \"I've never been involved in something like this,\" Luna marveled while lingering over an 18th-century Italian landscape painting with his brother-in-law, Jesse Martinez. \"Everything's built to perfection.\" \n",
      " Weatherwise, the weekend event was less than perfect, as clouds uncharacteristically hovered across much of Southern California, and Sunday rainstorms pelted Los Angeles. \n",
      " But the visitors hardly seemed to mind as they wandered through architect Richard Meier's quirkily elegant hilltop \"campus,\" pointing camcorders, pushing strollers and toting umbrellas supplied by the Getty. They browsed the museum's collections, watched traffic sloshing by on the San Diego Freeway and ate free boxed lunches in the shelter of a covered outdoor piazza. Many seemed intensely moved by what their 12 years of collective labor had wrought. \n",
      " And while the museum's priceless holdings of paintings, sculptures, photographs, decorative arts, drawings and Medieval manuscripts received plenty of attention, the visitors were equally eager to inspect their own handiwork and point it out to loved ones. \n",
      " \"They came to look at the paintings; I came to look at the structure,\" said Bruce Melton, an air-conditioning worker who had driven to the museum Sunday morning with his wife, Marta, and the couple's 9-year-old daughter Kelly from their home in Solvang, 120 miles away. \n",
      " The visitors also heard performances by a colorful array of musical acts, including Japanese drummers, klezmer bands and a local high school gospel choir. \n",
      " Though the Getty won't open officially until Dec. 16, the watery weekend provided the facility's first large-scale public baptism. Staffers on hand for the event looked pleased to see their new home buzzing with activity. \n",
      " \"After 14 1/2 years, we're seeing this place populated with people, the way it was supposed to be,\" said museum director John Walsh, who agreed that Sunday's unusually soggy skies constituted ideal museum-browsing weather. \n",
      " The weather also provided a litmus test for the Getty's expensive new louver-controlled gallery lighting system, and a trial run for El Nino's much-anticipated havoc. Apart from a minor leak here and there, Meier's buildings stayed high and dry. \n",
      " Foul weather wasn't about to stop Chuck McDaniel, his wife, Linda, and their daughter Carli from driving 75 miles Sunday from their home in Lebec. McDaniel hadn't visited the Getty site since working there two years ago. \n",
      " \"I'm really impressed,\" he said. \"The whole building is art. When I first walked in the lobby downstairs, it really made me feel good. The choir was singing. It was like heaven.\": [17767, 17749, 15673]\n",

      "They are the last significant figures left in a racketeering case that began two years ago with 17 defendants and has now been reduced to a trial of two men accused of being the Mafia controllers of the city's private garbage-hauling industry. \n",
      " For three months the two, Joseph Francolino Sr. and Alphonse Malangone, have sat impassively in state Supreme Court in Manhattan listening to witnesses and secretly recorded tapes. Prosecutors assert that evidence and testimony prove that the men ran a cartel that inflated the cost of doing business in the city by about $400 million a year. \n",
      " \"I'm the boss,\" Francolino, who the authorities say is a member of the Gambino crime family, is heard saying to an undercover detective who was posing as a refuse hauler seeking help in disputes with rivals in Manhattan. \n",
      " Later, the detective, Richard Cowan, testified that Malangone, whom prosecutors have identified as a Genovese family captain, boasted that he ran the trash-hauling industry in Brooklyn. \n",
      " In one secretly taped conversation with Cowan about a problem over contracts, Malangone said: \"I'll straighten it out with Joe. If it's a Brooklyn matter and you belong here, we don't have to check with Joe.\" \n",
      " Defense lawyers, in cross-examinations of Cowan, the prosecution's prime witness, have sought to minimize the tapes. They have contended that Francolino and Malangone, as the heads of trade associations, were legally trying to resolve contract disputes that the undercover agent had brought to their attention. \n",
      " In 1992, officials of Chambers Paper Fibers Co., a carting and recycling company, complained to city authorities that they were being harassed by gangsters. They agreed to allow Cowan to work undercover, posing as a company manager. The detective assumed the name Danny Benedetto and pretended to be a relative of Chambers' president, Salvatore Benedetto. \n",
      " In almost three years of undercover work, Cowan secretly recorded hundreds of conversations with most of the 17 original defendants in the case. He testified that extortion threats forced the Chambers company to pay about $790,000 to members of the alleged cartel after obtaining garbage-hauling contracts previously held by member companies of four trade associations that the prosecution says were dominated by the mob. \n",
      " The chief defense lawyers, Ronald Fischetti and Alan Futerfas, have indicated that they intend to argue in summations that it was the undercover agent who initiated meetings about the payments with Francolino and Malangone, who were the administrators of two major trade associations. \n",
      " A major contention by the the defense is that Chambers' payments were legitimate settlements for luring away customers who had contracts with other haulers. \n",
      " Cowan acknowledged that he solicited both defendants' help in reducing payments that rival haulers demanded of Chambers. The defense lawyers suggested that Francolino and Malangone intervened mainly to prevent lawsuits against Chambers. \n",
      " (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) \n",
      " Fischetti elicited testimony from Cowan that the $790,000 in payments had been provided to Chambers by the Manhattan district attorney's office. Fischetti said that he would try to persuade the jury that Salvatore Benedetto used the investigation to \"feather his own nest\" and as a means of expanding the company's business. \n",
      " Lawyers who have followed the trial say that the prosecution has developed a stronger case against Francolino than against Malangone. The lawyers note that Cowan engaged in several long recorded conversations in which Francolino discussed his influence in the industry, while the detective had only two brief meetings with Malangone. \n",
      " Moreover, on the extortion counts, the prosecution has shown that in 1994 the Chambers company paid about $19,000 to a carting company owned by Francolino. But no evidence has directly linked Malangone to suspicious payoffs. \n",
      " In 1995 the Manhattan district attorney's office obtained racketeering indictments against Francolino, 59, Malangone, 60, and 15 other executives of garbage-hauling companies and four trade associations. The charges of violating the state's Organized Crime Control Act and antitrust laws caused an upheaval in the city's commercial waste-removal and recycling industry. \n",
      " Earlier this year, 10 of the original 17 defendants pleaded guilty to reduced racketeering charges, with nine receiving prison terms. The trial of one defendant was severed after his lawyer died. \n",
      " Testimony began in May, but in July, four more co-defendants pleaded guilty to charges that they participated in the cartel. They will receive minimum prison sentences ranging from three to four and a half years. \n"

      " Kennedy struck a tree at roughly 4 p.m. while skiing in the picturesque mountain resort town in central Colorado, the Aspen Colorado Sheriff's Office announced. Ski patrol members were on the scene within minutes, administering first aid and bringing him to the base of the mountain. He was pronounced dead shortly before 6 p.m. \n",
      " His death brought more sorrow to a family singularly marked by tragedy. Kennedy's father and his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, were killed by assassins' bullets. His brother David died in 1984 of a drug overdose. \n",
      " \"Ethel Kennedy and her family are mourning the loss of their beloved son Michael,\" read a statement from Aspen Ski Co. \"He was a special and wonderful father, son, brother, cousin and friend, and his family would appreciate your prayers during this tragic time.\" \n",
      " Kennedy, who was once considered a rising star in the Kennedy clan, was investigated last spring by the authorities in Massachusetts after news organizations reported that he had had an affair with his family's teen-age baby-sitter. \n",
      " Kennedy was working as the campaign manager for his brother, Rep. Joseph Kennedy II of Massachusetts, who was running for governor of Massachusetts. The controversy played a role in Joseph Kennedy's withdrawal from the 1998 race last summer. \n",
      " The baby sitter, who was reportedly 14 at the time the affair began, and her family refused to press charges against Kennedy, and prosecutors halted their investigation. Having sex with a minor is considered statutory rape under Massachusetts law. \n",
      " Since the controversy, Kennedy had rarely appeared in public. He checked himself into an alcohol rehabilitation center in January. He and his wife, Victoria Gifford Kennedy, the daughter of sportscaster Frank Gifford, announced their separation and later reportedly reconciled. They had three children. \n",
      " Kennedy's cousin, John Kennedy Jr. wrote in an editorial that appeared in August in his magazine, George, that Michael and his brother Joseph, whose first marriage was annulled, were \"poster boys for bad behavior.\" In an interviewed aired on the CBS News program \"60 Minutes\" in October, Joseph Kennedy called his brother's behavior \"horrific.\" \n",
      " \"I made it very clear to Michael that his actions can never be condoned but need to be condemned,\" Joseph Kennedy said in the interview. \"And I have done so, as other members of my family have. \n",
      " \"It was just a horrific thing to do.\" \n",
      " Earlier, in June, in a speech to a convention of Massachusetts Democrats, Joseph Kenned said he was \"so very sorry for what has happened\" to the baby sitter's family. \n",
      " \"I love my brother,\" Kennedy also told the crowd of 2,000, which listened in silence. \"I will always love my brother, and I will stand with my brother.\" \n",
      " Michael Kennedy earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard University in 1980, according to a profile that appeared in the Boston Herald. While studying at Harvard, he and a friend founded a whitewater rafting business. \n",
      " He married his wife, Victoria, in 1981 and attended law school at the University of Virginia. After receiving his law degree, he briefly worked for a private law firm before joining Citizens Energy Corp. in 1984. He took over management of the corporation, a non-profit firm that delivered heating fuel to the poor, from his brother Joseph in 1988. \n",
      " Kennedy expanded the organization goals and increased fund raising. The organization sent emergency medical supplies to Africa in 1989 and distributed the anti-AIDS drug AZT to the poor. \n",
      " He also managed his uncle Edward M. Kennedy's successful re-election campaign to the U.S. Senate in 1994. \n",
      " In October 1995, Kennedy and a family friend, John Rosenthal, formed the nonprofit group Stop Handgun Violence. The group erected a massive billboard in Boston displaying the faces of 15 children killed by handguns that was part of a national public awareness campaign. ' \n",
      " Kennedy was 10 when his father was assassinated in California during the 1968 presidential campaign. The walls of his office were lined with photos of his father, according to a 1995 profile. In interviews, Kennedy cited his father's work as what motivated his own efforts. \n",

      "Maybe the Year of the Rat isn't turning out so bad for the United States and China after all. \n",
      " A few months ago, the two giants were in the midst of disputes over intellectual property rights and nuclear weapons proliferation, and seemed on the verge of a military confrontation over Taiwan. \n",
      " The State Department released a sharply critical report of China's human rights record, and momentum was building in Congress to oppose an extension of its normal trading status, also known as most-favored-nation treatment. \n",
      " Two powerful trade interests were caught in the middle. \n",
      " Microsoft Corp. needed a resolution of the piracy problem, to which it loses millions of dollars in sales each year. And The Boeing Co. bore the brunt of China's commercial backlash against U.S. diplomatic threats. \n",
      " Boeing paid a price for the Clinton administration's tough stance on trade, human rights, nuclear weapons proliferation and Taiwan. In April, China gave a $1.5 billion aircraft order to Europe's Airbus Industrie and signed a letter of intent with several of the consortium's partners to cooperate in a program to built a 100-passenger regional jetliner. \n",
      " Germany and France, both partners in Airbus, were thus rewarded for their nonconfrontational relations with China, their relatively soft stance on human rights and their willingness to stop selling arms to Taiwan. \n",
      " By contrast, some political and trade experts characterized relations between Beijing and Washington, D.C., as the worst since President Nixon went to China in 1972. \n",
      " But the tide began to turn slowly after the first-ever presidential elections on Taiwan on March 23, which overwhelmingly supported an extension of President Lee Teng-hui's Kuomintang administration. Lee's search for greater international recognition had triggered China's military threats against the island. \n",
      " In April, China stopped its military exercises near Taiwan, which had inadvertently caused widespread alarm elsewhere in Asia. Instead, it began mending fences and soothing nerves in the region. \n",
      " Beijing used several meetings in Southeast Asia to promote a peaceful image to its neighbors and is now spreading the message in the United States. \n",
      " \"China will never pose a threat to any country,\" Li Daoyu, Chinese ambassador to the United States, said during a visit to Seattle last week. \n",
      " In May, the United States withdrew its sanctions over China's alleged sale of sensitive nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan after Beijing promised not to do it again. President Clinton extended MFN, a move soon endorsed by Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole. \n",
      " And in June, the United States and China averted a major trade conflict after Beijing made far-reaching commitments to curb piracy and put meat on the bones of a landmark intellectual property rights agreement negotiated in February last year. \n",
      " As a result, the two countries called off $4 billion worth of tit-for-tat sanctions. The piracy deal prompted trade experts to issue a sigh of relief. \n",
      " \"We've stepped back from the brink,\" said Bob Kapp, head of the U.S.-China Business Council in Washington, D.C. \n",
      " Ambassador Li agreed. \n",
      " \"In recent months, we have seen some positive developments in U.S.-Sino relations,\" he said. \"It shows that dialogue and cooperation are better than confrontation.\" \n",
      " Relations continue to thaw. \n",
      " Last week, the House of Representatives failed in an attempt to deny MFN status to China. A majority of lawmakers agreed that the United States must stay engaged with the Chinese government regardless of its human rights and trade violations. (In a gesture to anti-China hard-liners, the House voted 411-7 to approve a measure requiring hearings that produce legislation dealing with China's objectionable policies.) \n",
      " Later this month, national security adviser Anthony Lake is expected to travel to China for high-level meetings, and congressional sources say another meeting between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin is likely after the presidential elections. \n",
      " And, in an apparent reversal of fortune, Chinese relations with its biggest European trading partner have suddenly turned sour. Germany last week froze a series of official contacts with China over a dispute concerning Beijing's human rights violations in Tibet, just a day after China canceled another official visit. \n",
      " China, angered by a German parliamentary resolution a week earlier condemning its rights record in Tibet, withdrew an invitation for German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel scheduled later this month. \n",
      " But Eden Woon, executive director of the Washington State China Relations Council, cautioned against too much optimism. \n",
      " \"Things will go up and down,\" he said. \"Nobody is going to be an outright winner with China. We still need a more stable relationship, which includes a high-level dialogue.\" \n",
      " The potential for U.S.-Sino relations to take another nose dive is always lurking just around the corner, he and other experts say. A recent incident in which U.S. investigators found that Chinese manufacturers had illegally exported 2,000 AK-47 assault weapons to the United States is a case in point. \n"

It was a noteworthy accomplishment for the team, which had recently endured a six-game losing streak, and for the rookie pitcher Bill Pulsipher, who recorded his first complete-game victory in the major leagues. \n",
      " With the midnight trade deadline approaching, most of the attention was focused on Saberhagen, who spent the game sitting in the Mets' dugout chewing gum and chatting with teammates before his last-minute trade to the Colorado Rockies. But while Saberhagen was being monitored, the Mets did their best to prove why losing their ace pitcher might not be so catastrophic. Rico Brogna belted a two-run homer and Carl Everett delivered a taste of his much-discussed potential with three hits as the Mets beat the Pirates for the third straight game. \n",
      " Pulsipher, showing more polish with each outing, improved to 3-5. The left-hander allowed nine hits and struck out six, but was more pleased by his number of walks allowed: zero. \n",

      "The free-agent period begins in the NHL with Eric Lindros still the limited property of the Philadelphia Flyers and Mark Messier probably free to make his own deal with any team. \n",
      " Both big centers may be interested in playing for the Rangers. But the Flyers' difficult decision to submit a contract proposal to Lindros Friday night makes Lindros a restricted free agent, with only conditional mobility. The Vancouver Canucks were not expected to pick up Messier's contract option by the midnight deadline Friday night. \n",
      " The Lindros decision came after a day of debate within the Flyers' hierarchy. Lindros suffered four concussions last season and criticized the team's medical care. He was stripped of his captaincy and relations had deteriorated between the Flyers and the Lindros family. Lindros is represented by his father, Carl Lindros. Eric Lindros still suffers from postconcussion symptoms and it is not certain he will ever play again. \n",
      " Early Friday General Manager Bob Clarke of the Flyers was unsure whether the Flyers would submit a qualifying offer of $8.5 million for next season, equal to Lindros' pay last season. Had the Flyers not made the offer, Lindros would have been unrestricted and free to sign with any team. \n",
      " \"Everything's a gamble,\" Clarke said. \"If someone wants him, it's a gamble on their part. If we want to keep him, it's a gamble on our part.\" \n",
      " Lindros still can sign with any team, but the Flyers have the right to match any contract offer and keep him. Should Lindros sign with another team, with the Flyers declining to match, they would get five first-round draft choices as compensation. Or, the two teams could work out a trade. \n",
      " Late Friday night, after extending the contract offer to Lindros, Clarke said: \"Eric Lindros is one of the top players in the game and is an integral part of our organization. We're hopeful that he will enjoy a complete recovery and return to play hockey at the high level to which we have become accustomed. \n",
      " \"On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the relationship between myself and Eric and his family has deteriorated. I intend to do whatever I can to try to move this relationship onto a better course.\" \n",
      " If Lindros signs his offer from Philadelphia, it appears as if the Flyers are obligated to pay him, even if he cannot play because of injuries. Can the Flyers avoid paying Lindros if he does not pass the physical examination before the season and is unable to play? Not according to the NHL Players' Association spokesman, Tim Wharnsby. \n",
      " \"If he signs it, he'll still get his money because the Flyers knew he was injured,\" Wharnsby said. \n",
      " When healthy, Lindros is one of the best players in the NHL. He won the Hart trophy as the most valuable player in 1995. But neither Lindros nor Messier is considered the powerful and intimidating force he was five years ago. When asked about his son's health, Carl Lindros said this week: \"He's progressing. He still has symptoms.\" But he declined to be specific. \n",
      " The Messier situation is less complicated. After three seasons with the Canucks, Messier is 39 years old. A popular captain who left the Rangers as a free agent in 1997 after six seasons, Messier could have stayed in Vancouver another season if the Canucks picked up a $6 million option on his contract. \n",
      " Should the Canucks decline, they would owe him a $2 million buyout and Messier would become an unrestricted free agent. Brian Burke, general manager of the Canucks, said this week, \"At this point in time, it is unlikely we will exercise our option.\" In 66 games, Messier scored 17 goals, with 37 assists. \n",
      " Doug Messier, Mark's father and agent, said Friday that the Canucks had not extended his son's contract and that an extension was not expected. From 1984 through 1990, Messier played on five Stanley Cup champions for the Edmonton Oilers. He added another ring with the Rangers in 1994. \n",
      " Glen Sather, the general manager and coach of those Oilers teams, is the new general manager of the Rangers. There is much speculation around the NHL that Messier will sign with Sather's Rangers, perhaps for a lower salary, to finish his career in New York. \n",
      " And there are hints of more movement along the Oilers-Rangers pipeline. A report in The Hartford Courant on Wednesday said the Rangers would name Ron Low as coach. But John Rosasco, a Rangers spokesman, said Sather would not name a coach until at least July 8. Low is a former coach of the Oilers. \n",
      " Sather last week got permission from the Flyers to talk to Lindros, and inquired about his health. Also getting permission were the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Dallas Stars and Carolina Hurricanes are also thought to be interested. Long an admirer of Messier's, the 27-year-old Lindros has said in the past that he would like to be Messier's teammate. \n",
      " Both men are represented by their fathers. When Messier left the Rangers in 1997, there was a rift between his father and some members of the Madison Square Garden management. But Doug Messier said Friday that it would not be an obstacle to his son returning. \n",
      " \"The future's what everything's about,\" Doug Messier said, adding that his son holds no grudges.: [9685, 9666, 8129]\n",

      " Disturbing new evidence suggests that the impact of powerful new AIDS drugs in reducing death rates has begun to wane at the same time that efforts to block the spread of the AIDS virus have reached a plateau. The task of bringing the AIDS epidemic under control will clearly require renewed vigor and new approaches to prevention. \n",
      " The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced at a meeting in Atlanta this week that the death rate from AIDS in the United States, which had dropped a startling 42 percent from 1996 to 1997, fell only 20 percent from 1997 to 1998. That was still a substantial decline but also a worrisome indication that further declines may be harder to achieve. Data from New York City suggest that the death rate for the first half of 1999 will be the same as in the first half of 1998. \n",
      " That leaves prevention as the best tool for curing the epidemic. But health experts report that the rate of HIV infection has leveled off at 40,000 new cases a year, a disturbing indication that prevention programs have stalled, especially in reaching minorities and young gay men. The death rate and incidence of AIDS among African-Americans is 10 times higher than among whites, and infection rates are soaring in some groups of gay males. It is an ironic twist that the very success of the new drug cocktails in warding off death from AIDS has bred complacency in some Americans who are returning to risky sexual behaviors.: [9154, 9146, 7822]\n",

      " At first, the children were crying because Meteor Crater was closed by the winds, according to Kelley Covert, a teacher's aide at Vernon Elementary. Then, as the wind rocked the bus and they saw a truck and trailer flip over, the kids became frightened and started crying for their mothers, she said. \n",

      " In a move that stunned many and without explanation, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also suggested that a judge other than Whipple be selected to preside over the case. The court's decision puts the district's future in question and could result in the public school system's remaining under federal court control for several more years. \n",
      " Whipple inherited the case in March 1997 from U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark, who oversaw the lawsuit for nearly two decades before deciding to transfer the case. Whipple declined to comment on Tuesday's decision. \n",
      " Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren who appealed Whipple's ruling, said: \"The schoolchildren were the victors in the court's decision. With focused prodding from the appeals court, the school district will have no excuse for failing to concentrate on improving achievement.\" \n",

      " In its 18-page opinion, the appeals court also suggested that the district court revisit the state's decision to strip the district of accreditation. The appeals court hinted strongly that it thought the state's action conflicted with previous court-ordered goals to improve student performance and close the achievement gap between black and white students. \n",
      " \"These developments, the result of state action, have placed (the district) in a most difficult situation...to deal with the difficult educational problems (the district) faces,\" Circuit Judge John R. Gibson wrote for the court. \n",
      " The appeals court suggested that the state and the district court work to reconcile their goals and to develop a single, clearly understood standard for the district to follow. \n",
      " Missouri Education Commissioner Robert Bartman said Tuesday night that he thought the district court and the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education could work together to develop a clear set of goals for improving achievement and shrinking the achievement gap. \n",
      " But he expressed worry that, without the threat of state accreditation being withdrawn, the district could backslide from recent efforts to improve. \n",
      " \"Unless there is some accountability that's real and imminent, the impetus of moving the district toward those goals is not going to be there, and we're going to lose another generation of kids who don't have access to a good quality education,\" Bartman said. \"The fact of the matter is, when the state board of education gave the district a little more than two years to perform or undergo mandatory restructuring, it did move the district toward focusing on the goals of student achievement.\" \n",
      " He said 15 years of court involvement had failed to produce similar results. \n",
      " \"Perhaps the fact there was no imminent threat of dissolution or restructuring caused the district to not be as intense toward fulfilling those goals,\" Bartman said. \"What's the fuel that's going to drive them to meet time schedules and targets? If you don't have some threat, albeit draconian, it's a more leisurely stroll through the park.\" \n",
      " The appeals court suggested that the district must improve academic performance and shrink the achievement gap before it can be freed from court control. \n",
      " The appeals court also suggested that the district court consider some form of monitoring to ensure that the district is moving steadily toward fully implementing a core curriculum, improving teacher training and holding students, teachers and administrators accountable. The court said such oversight should complement, and not conflict with, state efforts to improve student performance. \n",
      " The appeals court said the new monitors could protect the superintendent from the \"micro-management, politicization and pursuing of personal agendas by the board,\" previously recognized by the district court. \n",
      " School board President John Rios accused the appeals court judges of buying into inaccurate perceptions of the school board. \n",
      " \"That tells me they don't have any real understanding of what's going on,\" Rios said. \"We have been supportive of the superintendent and his efforts to get this district back to the way it should be run.\" \n",
      " Rios said he considered the appointment of monitors a step backward for the district. \n",
      " \"That's just adding back the layer of bureaucracy that has been stifling this district for so long,\" Rios said. \"They're not helping the school district. In fact, they're contributing to the chaos and confusion they had hoped to eliminate.\" \n",
      " Rios also had harsh words for Benson. \n",
      " \"He started the court case and he will not be satisfied until this district succumbs to mediocrity,\" Rios said. \n",
      " In his mid-November ruling, Whipple refused to block the state Board of Education's decision to strip the district of accreditation, and in a move that surprised many, dismissed the desegregation lawsuit. \n",
      " Whipple found that despite many remaining problems, the district had done all it could to eliminate segregation and should be freed from court control. \n",
      " Whipple found that the problems that remained, such as the lack of administrative talent, an overly political school board and endless litigation, were not constitutional violations and that the court had no authority to address them. \n",
      " But the appeals court suggested that those problems impeded the district's efforts to eliminate segregation and thus made them subject to court action. \n",
      " The district at one point was in settlement discussions with Benson and was close to an agreement that would have avoided the appeal. The settlement also would have eliminated any court-appointed monitoring. \n",
      " Demps had complained about having to respond to the demands of both the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee and the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, saying it was difficult to serve two masters. \n",

      " The company pamphlet features the two _ names changed to Sven and Olav to avoid any copyright violations _ in their muscle-flexing poses and underscores that it teaches stress management in \"a humorous and effective presentation.\" \n",
      " In the past four years, the Stensons, both of whom work at Phoenix-area hospitals, have given more than 150 similar seminars to groups ranging from the Arizona Bar Association to the state Department of Economic Security. None has complained, according to Steve Stenson. \n",
      " Steve Thomas of the Federal Highway Administration remembers the Stensons' program fondly. Thomas, the Phoenix branch's wellness coordinator, said his office enjoyed the skits and picked up useful tips on coping with stress. \n",
      " Asked whether any portion of the program was offensive, he replied, \"No. We were too busy laughing.\" \n",
      " Discussions of sexual fantasies never became lewd or graphic, Steve Stenson said, adding \"We cut them short when they do.\" \n",
      " And they often are tame, \"like ones involving Jell-O and Tom Selleck.\" \n",
      " He concedes that sometimes, people \"tell you more than you care to know . . . but it's all good-natured, it's all voluntary, and it's all in fun.\" \n",
      " For some reason, the humorous intent missed the mark at the Phoenix retreat and floated into the stratosphere of insensitivity. \n",
      " \"I had trouble seeing the relevancy,\" said Marcos Andrade, a neighborhood specialist who attended the retreat. \"They could have kept up the humorous tone without asking that question.\" \n",
      " The episode follows the sexual-harassment investigation of Bob Aronin, a prominent AIDS activist and a member of a City Council-appointed human-rights commission. \n",
      " Aronin, a gay man, was accused by two former underlings, also gay men, of harassing them. Among other things, Aronin supposedly asked them about their sexual practices and partners. The case was dropped largely on technical points. \n",
      " Phoenix administrators were so bothered by what went on at the retreat that they asked Steve Stenson to come to City Hall to apologize. \n",
      " He did, but he also defended the program as appropriate and well-intentioned. Perkins criticized Stenson for making \"unsolicited remarks,\" including the suggestion that people who are troubled by the fantasy question may be sexually repressed. \n",
      " The city plans to demand the return of the $950 fee. \n",
      " Steve Stenson took it all in stride. As he left City Hall on Monday, he offered an unsolicited piece of advice: \n",

      "He is thousands of miles from his 1980s Lakerland, physically as well as in his basketball soul. Look at Pat Riley now and you see a man with a pained expression on his face, constantly holding down two fingers. When he does that, he is not calling for peace. Usually it means that he wants his Miami Heat to run a specific play. \n",
      " That may be fine with the fans here. But Riley is partly responsible for sorry games like Saturday night's at Miami Arena. The Celtics lost it, 78-77, and the Heat didn't deserve to win it. Fittingly, the final 16 seconds were a symbol for the entire game. The key stat: a ball did not fall through the hoop. \n",
      " This is bad news if you're a fan of the NBA and worse if you're a fan of the Celtics. In those 16 seconds, the Celtics had the ball and got away three shots. Yet they walked away moaning about their 10th loss in 14 games. \n",
      " \"This was definitely a Pat Riley kind of game,\" Dee Brown said. The winning team shot 42 percent, the losers were at 37 and the halftime score was a Pete Carril Era 37-36 Heat. \n",
      " Still, at the end, Brown was able to say, \"On that last play, we ran exactly what we wanted to run. I guess I was just too wide open.\" \n",
      " Miami, supposedly the Atlantic Division's best team at 12-4, had a 77-68 lead with 1:41 remaining. The Celtics cut it to 78-75 after a Brown 3-pointer with a minute to play and then thought they tied the game on a bomb by Dana Barros. \n",
      " \"I thought it was a 3,\" Eric Williams said. \n",
      " So did the scoreboard operator. But the officials never wavered and awarded Boston 2 points. It was 78-77 with 40 seconds remaining. \n",
      " \"I knew it wasn't a 3,\" Barros said. \"I knew I was too close. I could look at the basket and tell that I wasn't far enough away.\" \n",
      " Celtics coach M.L. Carr thought it was a tie game and was convinced it should have been until he saw the replay. It was then that he conceded \"the officials were right.\" \n",
      " On this Night of No Offense, the call was not worth arguing. Forty seconds remained and the Heat had the ball. Boston played the odds and deduced that it would get another chance with the ball. Earlier, they had seen Dan Majerle miss a breakaway layup (he really bricked it), so what were the chances of a ball going through the hoop when the only Heat player to make half of his shots was P.J. Brown (2 of 4)? \n",
      " Of course, Miami missed. And there were those 16 seconds. \n",
      " \"Dee was one of the options,\" Carr said. \"If it wasn't open for him, we were going to go with Dino (Radja)\" \n",
      " No need for the secondary option. Brown got the ball on the right side, began dribbling with his back to the basket, and saw all rim and net because Miami defender Sasha Danilovic had fallen to the court. He released a shot that, he said, felt great. \n",
      " The ball rolled around the rim and out. \n",
      " But the Celtics were much more competent on the boards than they were in the washout against the Rockets 24 hours earlier. So three ticks remained and 6-foot-6-inch Todd Day was able to snake toward the lane for the rebound. As he was in the air, he pushed a shot toward the rim. \n",
      " \"I don't think I could have gotten a better shot,\" he said. \n",
      " Once again, the ball rolled around the rim and out. \n",
      " \"The rim was unkind,\" Day said. \n",
      " Maybe. But no one could say it was biased. Both teams moved the ball slowly. You wondered if these were the same head coaches who experienced the fluidity and freestyling of Lakers-Celtics throughout the '80s. Certainly, neither team has Larry, Magic, DJ or Kareem. But did the Heat guarantee $100 million to Alonzo Mourning so they could watch him rebound (16 boards, 17 points) all their misses? \n",
      " \"It was kind of ugly,\" allowed Miami's Tim Hardaway. \n",
      " As for the Celtics, the positive thing was that they never trailed by more than 9, they had only eight turnovers and managed to get a combined 28 points and 15 rebounds from Williams and Radja. \n",
      " \"We shot 36 percent and still had a chance to win a ballgame on the road,\" Carr said. \n"
