      "(Washington, DC) - A ruling on July 6, 2011, by Mexico's Supreme Court should bring reform of Mexico's flawed military justice system and accountability for soldiers accused of human rights violations closer, Human Rights Watch said today. The court ruled that Mexico's courts are obligated to comply with an Inter-American Court judgment in an enforced disappearance case and that its jurisprudence should be taken into account by Mexico's judges.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a binding November 2009 judgment, Radilla Pacheco v. Mexico, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that the Mexican military was responsible for the disappearance of Rosendo Radilla Pacheco in Guerrero state in 1974 and that the government had failed to investigate the crime adequately. The Inter-American Court ordered Mexico to modify its Code of Military Justice to make it \"compatible with international standards,\" and said that, \"Regarding situations that violate the human rights of civilians, military jurisdiction cannot operate under any circumstance.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mexico's highest court has found that the Inter-American Court's ruling must be the law of the land: no cases of human rights violations should be tried in the military justice system,\" said José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"President Calderón and Congress should swiftly reform military jurisdiction to ensure that this ruling is upheld.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Radilla decision is one of four since 2008, including two in 2010, in which the Inter-American Court found that members of Mexico's military committed grave human rights violations against civilians. In August 2010, the Inter-American Court found that Valentina Rosendo Cantú and Inés Fernández Ortega, indigenous women from Guerrero, had been raped and tortured by members of the army in 2002. In December 2010, the court ruled the military had detained and tortured two peasant ecologists, Rodolfo Montiel and Teodoro Cabrera. The Inter-American Court has repeatedly stated that military jurisdiction should not apply to any human rights violations committed against civilians, a requirement Mexico has not met.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2010, Calderón proposed reforms to the military justice system that fall short of what is required by the Inter-American Court's rulings, Human Rights Watch said. The proposal would require that three types of human rights violations - enforced disappearance, rape, and torture - be tried before civilian jurisdiction, while other serious violations would continue to be investigated and prosecuted within the military justice system. It would also grant military authorities the power to determine which acts constitute such violations, despite the military's track record of downgrading the severity of charges against soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 7, the Supreme Court will take up the relevance of international human rights standards in relation to Mexico's constitution. Human Rights Watch urges the Supreme Court to safeguard the recent constitutional reform passed by Congress, which elevates the rights enshrined in international treaties signed by Mexico to equal footing alongside the rights guaranteed by the Mexican Constitution. As a party to international treaties, Mexico has an obligation to give effect to such rights in its domestic law, as well as to take their jurisprudence into account in judicial proceedings - an obligation the Supreme Court should uphold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The justices have upheld a view espoused by UN bodies, as well as in recent decisions in the European, Inter-American, and African human rights courts that limit the application of military jurisdiction in cases where its impartiality is questionable,\" Vivanco said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the draft principles on military justice adopted by the former United Nations Human Rights Commission, principle No. 9 states that, \"In all circumstances, the jurisdiction of military courts should be set aside in favour of the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts to conduct inquiries into serious human rights violations such as extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances and torture, and to prosecute and try persons accused of such crimes.\" This has also been the position of the European human rights bodies and the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) also indicate that trials before military courts can raise fair trial concerns. For instance, in Findlay v. United Kingdom, the ECHR reasoned that for a ruling to be independent and impartial, it has to have some degree of finality. It found that a military court's ruling was neither independent nor impartial, because the members of the court who issued the decision were subordinates of the prosecuting officer, who had the authority to change any decision that the court made. In Suleiman v. Sudan, the African Commission on Human and People's Rights held not only that the military tribunal was not impartial, but also reaffirmed that military tribunals should only \"determine offences of a purely military nature committed by military staff\" and \"should not deal with offences which are under the purview of ordinary courts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As Human Rights Watch documented in its report \"Uniform Impunity,\" in Mexico the secretary of defense wields both executive and judicial power over the armed forces. Military judges have little job security and may reasonably fear that the secretary could remove them or otherwise sideline their careers for issuing decisions that he dislikes. Civilian review of military court decisions is very limited. To make matters worse, there is virtually no public scrutiny of, or access to information about, what actually happens during military investigations, prosecutions, and trials, which can take years.\n",

      "Over the last fourteen years, Liberians have known little but warfare.Conflict and civil war have devastated the country and taken an enormous toll on the lives of its citizens, especially children.Thousands of children have been victims of killings, rape and sexual assault, abduction, torture, forced labor and displacement at the hands of the warring factions.Children who fought with the warring parties are among the most affected by the war.Not only did they witness numerous human rights violations, they were additionally forced to commit abuses themselves.\n",

      "Both of the opposition groups, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), as well as government forces which include militias and paramilitary groups widely used children when civil war resumed in 2000.In some cases, the majority of military units were made up primarily of boys and girls under the age of eighteen.Their use and abuse was a deliberate policy on the part of the highest levels of leadership in all three groups.No precise figures exist as to how many children were used in the last four years of warfare; however, United Nations (U.N.) agencies estimate that approximately 15,000 children were involved in the fighting.[1]\n",

      "Although international law prohibits the use of children in armed conflict, thousands of children, some as young as nine and ten years old, were used by the fighting forces in Liberia.The use of child[2] soldiers poses a serious threat to the rights of children, including their rights to life, to health, to protection and to education.Many child soldiers have suffered egregious abuses:forced conscription into the armed groups; beatings and other forms of torture; and psychological damage resulting from being forced to kill others.Girl soldiers have suffered the additional humiliation of rape and sexual servitude, sometimes over periods of several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children interviewed for this report spoke of the general hardships of war and of the particular difficulties of their lives as fighters.Many of the children were forcibly recruited into the fighting forces during round-ups conducted by government forces or during raids on refugee and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps by LURD and later by MODEL fighters.Other children volunteered to fight.Reasons some cited for this decision included a desire to avenge abuses against themselves or their families, a need to gain some form of protection, or a perception that this was the only way to survive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boy and girl fighters typically received limited training in operating automatic weapons, mortars and rocket propelled grenades.Taught to maneuver in combat, to march, and to take cover, children were often the first sent out to the front lines where they faced heavy combat.Children were also charged with other tasks such as manning roadblocks, acting as bodyguards to commanders, looting from civilians and abducting other children.Although younger children were generally used as porters, cooks, cleaners and as spies, children as young as nine and ten were sometimes armed and active in combat.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to their military duties, girls with the armed groups were raped and sexually enslaved by the fighters.One girl who spoke with Human Rights Watch, fourteen at the time of her abduction, was raped by many fighters and later assigned to a commander as a wife.Girl fighters were collectively known as 'wives', whether attached to a particular soldier or not.Some older girls were able to avoid sexual abuse, sometimes by capturing other girls for sexual servitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children described beatings, torture and other punishments inflicted on them by commanders for alleged infractions of rules.Children were tied and beaten for stealing, for failing to follow orders, and for abusing the civilian population.Nevertheless, child soldiers were complicit in abuses against civilians-including murder, rape and widespread looting-often committed with the involvement of their adult superiors.Boy soldiers were often drugged prior to facing combat by commanders handing out pills.Boys described these drugs as making them feel fearless during fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enforced ceasefire brought an end to much of the fighting in Liberia in August 2003 and the presence of peacekeepers from the U.N. Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) has brought some security to the capital Monrovia and its immediate environs.Many of the children involved with the warring parties have since left their units.However, in areas outside of UNMIL control, children remain actively engaged with the fighters.\n",
      "\n",
      "An extensive demobilization program, scheduled to recommence in January 2004, includes specific provisions for child soldiers.Their rehabilitation, however, remains an enormous challenge: whole communities have been destroyed; populations have been displaced; and many children have lost one or more family members.Children who spoke with us expressed fear, confusion and concern about their future, underlining the need for psychological and practical support to help them readjust to civilian life.In addition, the widespread rape and sexual assault of girls necessitates urgent medical attention and for some girls, assistance in child support and care for their children.Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to fully fund the demobilization programs for child soldiers and to provide additional assistance to girls and women who are victims of sexual violence and abuse.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vast majority of child soldiers told us of their desire to return to school, to receive an education and to make something of their lives.Some of the boy soldiers interviewed became fighters after having dropped out of school because they were no longer able to afford the costs.Many are now unsure of their ability to pay for schooling, as school fees and other related expenses make education unaffordable for many Liberians.The national transitional government has recently announced an ambitious program of universal primary education for all Liberians, but its implementation will require a significant investment.To make primary education available to all, the government must first pay teachers salary arrears, train new teachers, purchase school materials and rebuild and construct new schools and classrooms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch encourages the government to fulfill its international obligations to guarantee the right of primary education to all Liberians as a means of long-term rehabilitation.We call on the international community to assist the government in its endeavor, with appropriate financial and technical support so that all children affected by the conflict may receive an education.As one child right's worker in Monrovia suggested, a literate population with educational opportunities for all children could help prevent future conflict and children from taking up arms again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methodology\n",
      "\n",
      "This report is based on research conducted in Liberia from August through November 2003.We conducted interviews with former and current child soldiers in the capital and surrounding displaced persons camps in Montserrado, and in Bomi and Grand Bassa counties.Human Rights Watch researchers conducted interviews with over forty-five children and young adults who were members of the LURD, MODEL and militias and paramilitary groups of the government forces.Children ranged in age from ten to seventeen years old; some had been with the fighting forces for a few months, while others had been involved for several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also conducted numerous interviews with members of the national transitional government of Liberia, representatives of nongovernmental organizations, church and civic leaders, members of the diplomatic community and representatives of the warring factions.The names of all children interviewed for this report have been changed to protect their privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations\n",
      "\n",
      "To the National Transitional Government of Liberia (including representatives from the former Armed Forces of Liberia, government paramilitary and militia forces, LURD, and MODEL):\n",
      "\n",
      "Immediately end the use and recruitment of all children under the age of eighteen in the fighting forces.Present any children currently affiliated with the forces to cantonment centers for demobilization and support and encourage these children, especially girls, to enter the demobilization programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "With coordination through the National Demobilization Commission, encourage all children who fought in the conflict to present themselves at cantonment areas for assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Make certain that rehabilitation programs for child soldiers are tailored to meet the special requirements of girl soldiers including the creation of special childcare centers for girl mothers and health and counseling programs for survivors of rape and/or sexual assault.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enact national legislation that would make eighteen the minimum age for recruitment to the newly formed national army.Ensure that such legislation contains punitive measures for those found in violation of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a matter of priority, ensure the rights of children to free primary education by progressively eliminating as rapidly as possible all school fees and related costs for elementary education.Focus rehabilitation efforts on rebuilding the education system.Ensure that no child is denied enrollment to primary school and create accelerated schooling or other appropriate programs where necessary for war-affected children who have missed educational opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "To All Donor Countries to Liberia:\n",
      "\n",
      "At the donors' conference on Liberia to be held in New York on February 5 and 6, 2004, ensure that necessary funding is given to fully finance the demobilization program.Specific financing should be pledged for rehabilitation and reintegration programs for child soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Insist that rehabilitation programs for child soldiers include special provisions for girl soldiers.At a minimum, these should include health care and psychosocial counseling for girls who are survivors of rape and sexual assault and childcare centers for girl mothers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognize that the long-term well being of former child soldiers depends on both a successful demobilization program as well as longer-term rehabilitation projects which include child soldiers and all children affected by the conflict.Provide financial assistance to social services with emphasis on rebuilding the education system in Liberia with an aim to securing the rights to education for all children in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Support the U.N. peacekeeping force (UNMIL) so that it has the necessary financing and manpower to deploy throughout Liberia for the proposed two year period to protect children and all Liberians.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Government of the United States:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure that of the $200 million earmarked for Liberia, sufficient funding is provided to the demobilization program for children, with emphasis on rehabilitation and reintegration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide technical assistance to Liberia in all aspects of education, through teacher training, materials, school building and financial support to the Ministry of Education to help rebuild the system of education in Liberia.As security improves, consider sending professionals and volunteers to Liberia who have expertise in the fields of education and pedagogy.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL):\n",
      "\n",
      "Engage and deploy as soon as possible the two proposed child protection advisors to assist the Secretary General's office in Liberia with related child protection activities for UNMIL personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure that the human rights section of UNMIL works in coordination with the United Nations Mission in Cte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) to detect and report on the movement of child combatants from Liberia into neighboring Cote d'Ivoire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have the human rights section of UNMIL properly document the use of children in combat during the last fourteen years of conflict so it may be used in future accountability mechanisms including the mandated Truth and Reconciliation Commission and possible tribunals with jurisdiction to try war crimes and other serious human rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF):\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue to work closely with the Disarmament, Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Reintegration (DDRR) process, evaluating the programs for their appropriateness for former child soldiers to ensure that their needs are being met.Strengthen national awareness campaigns to ensure that the maximum numbers of children are involved in the DDRR process.Work closely with members of the Joint Implementation Unit (national coordination unit) so that the interim care centers are fully operational and contain the necessary elements to assist children.Ensure that adequate protection measures for girls are prioritized in the interim care centers.In addition, health and psychosocial care for those girls who were abducted and sexually abused should be provided in the centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As security permits, establish regional offices in the countryside to facilitate successful reintegration and rehabilitation of child soldiers to their families and communities.Make certain that counselors and child protection officers continue to visit child soldiers in their homes for extended periods after their home placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR):\n",
      "\n",
      "Enhance protection measures at refugee camps in Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone so that Liberian and other children from the region are protected from recruitment into regional conflicts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict in Liberia, which began in late 1989, when then rebel leader Charles Taylor launched an incursion from neighboring Cte d'Ivoire, has been characterized by brutal ethnic killings and massive abuses against the civilian population.Although the conflict is rooted in historical grievances, the brutal tactics employed from 1989 to 1997, including targeting of particular ethnic groups by Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and later the United Liberian Movement for Democracy in Liberia (ULIMO) were previously unknown in Liberian history.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the almost eight years of fighting before a binding ceasefire was negotiated in 1997, numerous efforts to bring about peace were unsuccessful.In the interim, civilians suffered at the hands of the fighting groups; thousands of Liberians were killed in the fighting and subject to torture, beatings, rape, and sexual assault, resulting in massive displacement inside and outside the country.Following the ceasefire of 1997, Charles Taylor, former head of the NPFL, was elected as president of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Taylor government was marred by widespread corruption and abuse, further widening the divisions and deepening popular resentments caused by the civil war.State power was regularly used for the personal enrichment of government officials with little or no accountability to the Liberian citizenry.The LURD incursion from Guinea, which began in 2000, was the fifth serious outbreak of violence in Liberia since Taylor's election and launched Liberia back into four more years of civil warfare.[3]In 2003, a negotiated ceasefire, the departure of Charles Taylor from office and the country, and the deployment of regional and later international peacekeepers have brought an end to major conflict, although fighting and human rights abuses persist in areas outside the U.N.'s control.\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of children as soldiers dates to the start of the conflict in 1989.Taylor's NPFL became infamous for the abduction and use of boys in war; a tactic later adopted by other Liberian fighting factions as well as other fighting groups in West Africa.[4]Between 6,000 and 15,000 children are estimated to have taken up arms from 1989 to 1997.[5]A demobilization program conducted in 1997 was only partially successful in rehabilitating children, in part due to limited funding and insecurity in the countryside.Many of the same children who had fought previously became easily re-recruited when fighting resumed in 2000.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "Recruitment of Children\n",
      "\n",
      "The latest round of warfare to engulf Liberia began in July 2000 with the LURD incursion from Guinea into northern Lofa County.Fighting between LURD and government forces, characterized by territory changing hands from one group to the other and then back again, intensified in 2002 with a LURD offensive against the capital, Monrovia.LURD forces forcibly recruited adults and children to join their ranks drawing from Liberians living in refugee camps in Guinea as well as from areas of newly captured territory.Government forces also conducted conscription raids within neighborhoods in Monrovia, remilitarized former combatants and armed adults and children to fight against LURD.[7]In early 2003, MODEL split from LURD and began an offensive from its bases in Cte d'Ivoire capturing towns in eastern Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "As LURD and MODEL each pushed towards Monrovia and Buchanan in the first half of 2003, these two groups together with government forces stepped up their recruitment of adults and children.While some children volunteered to join the forces, many others were forcibly recruited during recruitment drives or following the capturing of new territory as front lines switched hands.Some children joined particular forces to avenge violations committed against their family members.Conversely, some children joined those same forces that committed abuses in their communities to offer protection to themselves and their families.With the attacks on Monrovia from June through August 2003, more children became involved with the fighting forces both as combatants and helpers some driven by the need to help find scarce food and water for their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "LURD Advance\n",
      "\n",
      "As the LURD forces advanced on Monrovia in early 2003, they attacked displaced persons camps in Montserrado County, exchanging fire with government soldiers positioned nearby.The attacks prompted many civilians to flee closer to Monrovia while hundreds of others from those camps were forced to retreat with LURD back to bases in the interior.Among the groups of men and women were children targeted in the raids and subsequently trained to fight for LURD.Children now living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps told us of the forced retreat with LURD, the recruitment and how they came to be involved with the forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to one youth leader, who was present the day of the attack on Rick's Institute (a school outside of Monrovia) IDP camp:\n",
      "\n",
      "LURD fighters came here and attacked; this was on March 25, 2003.They overran the camp and people tried to hide and flee the advance.There was fighting between the government troops and LURD and some people were killed by stray bullets.Following the exchange, LURD rounded up hundreds of residents and forced them to return to Bomi County.Many of the children involved in our programs were taken, boys and girls, only some have returned.I later heard that some of the girls, they died because of how they were treated, victims of torture and sexual assault. [8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventeen at the time, Johnny S., was rounded up on the day of the attack at Rick's IDP camp:\n",
      "\n",
      "I was captured by LURD together with plenty of others.My thirteen-year-old sister was among them.I haven't seen her since the war ended.They took us back to Bomi to be trained to fight. I was assigned for training but escaped a few days later when sent out for water.Born in Bomi County, I knew the area well and could escape. Others, like my sister, were not so lucky. [9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Another of the unlucky ones, sixteen-year-old Isaac T., spent the next six months fighting for LURD:\n",
      "\n",
      "We were all taken from here (Rick's IDP camp), at least fifty boys on that day.The youngest boy fighter was probably fifteen, younger ones were taken but only used for labor.We were taken to Bomi and trained in how to fire, how to take positions during the fighting.How to take cover and to dodge bullets.There were probably one hundred boys who did the training, the others came from neighboring camps.The training lasted about two weeks and right afterwards, I was on the front lines. [10]\n",
      "\n",
      "From March through June, LURD forces came closer to Monrovia, attacking and retreating from IDP camps nearer the capital.At Jahtondo displaced persons camp, LURD attacked several weeks after the assault on Rick's camp, causing civilians, some of whom had fled earlier assaults at outlying camps including Ricks, to flee once again.At Wilson Corner IDP camp, in early May, LURD fighters clashed with government troops, causing panic and flight among the civilian population.According to two child soldiers, both the government forces and the LURD forcibly recruited children from the two camps at that time.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Children also taken from Plumkor camp in May explained how they were abducted:\"I was caught on the road, just outside of camp, when fleeing the LURD attack.I was taken to Bomi with a group of others and taught to fire, take cover and to kill.\"[12]Ellen S., who later became a female commander, was taken that same day.\"When LURD came, they caught a lot of young girls and carried us to Bong County.They can force you, you say no, but they carry you or they can beat you to death.They carried me to train-to learn to fight, how to fire, to dodge bullets and how to kill somebody.The training lasted two weeks.\"[13]\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all children were forcibly recruited; others joined LURD because of the abuse they suffered at the hands of government soldiers.Children in the camps and greater Monrovia area described the abusive practice of government soldiers-rape and sexual harassment, beatings, stealing, and their obligation to perform labor.Youth leader Roland B., explained that in the months leading up to the LURD attacks, government soldiers were complaining that they were not getting paid. They additionally accusedresidents of being LURD sympathizers and took their frustrations out on the camp populations-not only stealing, but raping young girls in the camp and beating boys for refusing to perform labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christopher J., a thirteen-year-old, third grade student, described the abuse by government forces:\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year before the war came here, government fighters forced me to work for them.I was made to carry things from the surrounding areas to the paved road, where they would be collected.I had to carry pieces of zinc (corrugated iron sheeting) that were very heavy, we were not allowed to rest.The soldiers didn't ask you to do this, they would force you, there was no pay.Sometimes if you tried to run away, they would catch you and this is when they would beat you.I was beaten on the back and shoulders with the end of their rifles.When LURD came to this area, I decided it was better to join them and escape the abuse. [14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Seventeen-year-old, Eric G. stated that he joined the LURD:\n",
      "\n",
      "After government militias beat and slapped me and held me in dirty water.On July 6, seven militia men came to my house, they tied my elbows behind my back and beat me.They raped my mother and two sisters in front of me.My youngest sister is sixteen years old.The seven of them took turns with them and I was forced to watch.So, I had to go and fight them to revenge my mother and sisters. [15]\n",
      "\n",
      "Jimmy D. joined the LURD following abuse at the Duala market on Bushrod Island, on the outskirts of Monrovia:\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason I joined LURD is because of police abuse.I was selling bread at the market, trying to make some money to have something to eat and survive.A policeman came up to me, threw all my bread in the water and said I should go away.I was later beaten for that.When the fighters came to our area, I joined with them. [16]\n",
      "\n",
      "In one case, the abuses by government forces had the opposite effect.James. T. explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did I join the government forces?To end the abuse against me and my family.Government militia members would beat my uncle and force him to carry cooking oil long distances.Myself, I was made to tote large bags of cassava to distant military positions.Finally, I decided I couldn't take the abuse and forced labor anymore.Better to join them, so they would not continue to disturb my people.I joined in March 2003.I was fifteen years old. [17]\n",
      "\n",
      "In June and July 2003, LURD attacked Monrovia three times before a previously negotiated ceasefire was finally enforced by regional troops sent by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).In the three assaults, locally described as World Wars I, II and III, over 2,000 civilians in Monrovia were killed by indiscriminate shelling and gunfire.[18]During these offensives, children from Bushrod Island joined LURD both as fighters and helpers, often to secure needed food for their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samson T., a former child soldier of Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL), joined LURD in July after the second attack on Monrovia, in part due to growing hunger.Because of his past fighting experience, he was immediately handed a gun. Through his status as a LURD fighter, he was able to secure food and supplies for himself and his relatives.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "After LURD captured the strategic port at Bushrod Island, it looted food and supplies and distributed them to the civilian population.With access to food supplies, LURD's treatment of civilians on Bushrod Island was considerably better than in many other areas of Liberia.Sixteen year old Francis R. described himself as a LURD civilian and was charged with delivering food.\"I was sympathetic to LURD because they were protecting us, they gave us food and helped us out.So my job during World War III was to carry food that was distributed at the port back to my people here.\"[20]\n",
      "\n",
      "Matthew T. fled Bushrod Island during the first assault on Monrovia (World War I), but during the next two attacks, stayed behind and like, Francis R., helped run errands and deliver food but did not fight.As he explained:\n",
      "\n",
      "I never fought, why kill innocent people?Some boys did join LURD, tempted by material things. Others opted to join for revenge, they had been abused by the militias or the police.LURD would promise them cars, money or mattresses.But in the end, they got nothing at all but death.Really, I saw children as young as ten dying on both sides.Some were fighting just to find some daily bread. [21]\n",
      "\n",
      "Government Forces\n",
      "\n",
      "Charles Taylor's NPFL used child soldiers extensively in groups known as Small Boys Units (SBUs) in the 1990s.Following a demobilization program in 1997, many children left the forces, entering official rehabilitation programs or simply abandoning the groups on their own.After his election as president that same year, Taylor relied heavily on militias and paramilitary forces he created to defend his government.When LURD began its uprising in Lofa County in 2000, paramilitary groups like the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU) and the Special Security Service (SSS) and militia groups led by Taylor loyalists began actively recruiting men, women and again children to fight.Initially, these groups drew on former fighters of the NPFL including child soldiers but increasingly sought out new and younger recruits.These militia groups also included numerous child combatants from the Sierra Leonean Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which Taylor had supported since its inception in l991.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many children who fought with the government from 2000 to 2003 were picked up in round-ups on the streets, traveling to and from schools and at their homes.They were trained and transported to Lofa and other counties to fight the initial LURD uprising.A counselor who works with children explained that as the war intensified in 2002, parents in and around Monrovia stopped sending their children to school.While this was in part due to lack of money to pay school fees, parents additionally kept their children at home as children would be picked up on their way to and from school.According to this counselor, by 2003 government forces would come and physically take children from barely functioning schools and place them in the SBUs.In June and July 2003, with the LURD assaults on Monrovia, more children took up arms and became affiliated with the forces to protect themselves and their families and to loot.For some families, children became the only source of income, using their guns to steal food and other household goods.[22]\n",
      "\n",
      "John J., a former child soldier who fought in the mid-90's, fought again beginning in 2000 with Jungle Lion, a government militia, for three years in Lofa and Bomi counties:\n",
      "\n",
      "I was living in Monrovia, doing small jobs when I could.One day near the Duala market, I was standing on the side of the road selling goods.Government forces came by in pickup trucks.There was no way you could run away.They picked up six boys and myself there on the road side.We were transported to Bomi and then Lofa County.We were some of the first forces sent to Lofa. [23]\n",

      "Seventeen-year-old, Charles Q., described his involvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year, I was still in school and on my way home to Congo town (Monrovia). There were government forces in my neighborhood.They had come in pickup trucks and forced us to go with them to Lofa.That day, I had just left school, put down my books and was outside.They told us, 'we are looking for people to fight', not really asking you, just picking you up.There was no choice. [24]\n",

      "Taken earlier this year, Morris C. was picked up in a similar raid:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am from Bomi but my family fled to Bushrod Island a few years ago.I was fifteen when I was caught and made to fight.I was on my way to school around 8:30 in the morning, when I was caught at Point 4 junction. Other children wearing yellow t-shirts with Jungle Fighter written on the back forced us at gunpoint into the trucks.They said I had to join them and fight to protect Monrovia. [25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Children were also regularly recruited in government raids on the displaced camps near Monrovia in 2002 and 2003.Parents soon learned to keep their children inside when the government forces visited the camp, since they regularly rounded up adults and boys to fight. As one mother told Human Rights Watch, \"one of my sons was taken away from the camp by government militias before World War II. He was sixteen years old. At that time they used to run behind the children and carry them away, so if you had children, you'd keep them inside.\"[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some children fighting with the government militias were tasked with recruiting other children to fight.Often forcibly recruited themselves, they in turn forced other children to join with them.A bodyguard to a commander of the Army Division militia, Allen R. was in an SBU for several years fighting in Lofa and around Monrovia.Forced to fight with the Army division, he received his training at Camp Shefflin along with other boys and young men.During his time in Monrovia \"we would go around town in pickup trucks, looking for children to fight.Each militia has their own SBU, which includes boys and girls.SBUs are taught to fight and serve, we carry weapons, go on reconnaissance and do odd jobs. The girls in the SBUs are there to wash clothes, bring water and cook.Older girls are the fighters.\"[27]\n",

      "Solomon F., a former child soldier from the 1990's, detailed their recruitment tactics:\n",
      "\n",
      "How did I get involved in the fighting?I was going to school myself, but after school on my way home, the child soldiers caught me and took me away.I was placed in a SBU and became a deputy commander.SBUs can fight, but their main job is to draw water, clean arms, carry out duties.SBUs are young ones, who don't know about the war, but we catch them and teach them.\n",
      "\n",

      "Almost every child interviewed for this report had a fighting name, whether or not they were actual combatants.These names often signified particular characteristics of the children or their actions in the fighting.One counselor who works with children in Monrovia suggested that such a practice helped keep children in control as they would forget about their old lives and families.He gave the example of 'Mother's Blessing', a name given by one commander to a boy soldier.The commander had told the child that his mother was killed in the fighting and that she blessed him to go fight against the government troops.Later this same boy found out his mother was still alive.[58]\n",
      "\n",
      "Other names explained to researchers were:'Laughing and Killing' because the boy soldier would laugh as he killed enemy fighters; 'Disgruntled' because the child soldier was not satisfied with the fighting; 'Captain No Mercy' because the officer would kill if someone disobeyed orders; and 'Walking Stick' because this child was made to walk directly behind his commander.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children also were given names describing their acts of brutality towards other children and adults.Some boys and girls had names which indicated what they would do to captured civilians, including names like 'Castrator', 'Ball Crusher', 'Nut Bag Mechanic', and 'Bush Lover'.Some girls also had names such as 'Iron Panty' describing their genitalia either because they refused to have sex or because they were believed to engage in numerous sexual activities.Finally other names might describe punishment-one child was named 'Dirty Water' because he was made to bathe in a hole full of waste for committing an infraction.[59]\n",
      "\n",
      "Children were rarely given military uniforms to wear, but were issued T-shirts which named their fighting groups and sometimes their fighting slogan.The exception was MODEL who had some uniforms from the former Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) but not all MODEL fighters were issued fatigues and like LURD and government forces, most child soldiers in MODEL wore T-shirts. In addition, some children were also involved in units like the 'Buck Naked Unit,' where fighters went into combat naked in order to terrorize opponents and civilians. A female commander with LURD also described how her unit would enter combat clad only in undergarments because they believed this appearance would both strengthen their magical protection and intimidate enemies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children serving with the government forces were usually issued yellow T-shirts, but other colors used were green, red or black.According to the children, the name of the unit, such as Jungle Lion or Jungle Fire, would be written on the front, and the division on the back.Arms and weapons were often distributed at the same time as T-shirts.Children fought with RPGs, AK-47s, submachine guns and what they described as '60's, automatic weapons where the ammunition belts would be worn wrapped around the torso.[60]\n",
      "\n",
      "Boys and girls in LURD described similar weaponry as was used by the government forces but some were also responsible for loading and firing mortars.T-shirts given to children were emblazoned with LURD forces and on the back slogans, such as 'no dog, no rest' or 'no monkey'.According to several of the fighters, these were derogatory statements towards Charles Taylor and his government.Samson T. described the significance:\n",
      "\n",
      "'No monkey' this was the name that we gave to the forces of Taylor, we wanted him out and so this was to say 'go away'.For us, the LURD, they called us 'no baboon.'The reason for this is because some of us wear black like baboons.Also, the baboon is a strong animal and can fight good just like LURD. [61]\n",
      "\n",
      "Hairstyle also played a role in unit identification.Some groups had particular hairstyles and would prohibit the cutting of hair.For example, in certain units of Jungle Lion militia, part of the government forces, recruits were not allowed to cut their hair and small braids were fashionable.In some squads of MODEL, hair was colored orange and these children were particularly feared for their atrocities committed against civilians.Some children who served with LURD and government forces told us that when they were taken, their heads were shaved and this formed part of their initiation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children were also initiated into their units through scarification and were given charms and amulets for protection.The practice of initiation is rooted in Liberian culture as in many parts of Liberia, boys and girls become accepted adults in society by undergoing secret initiations.Some analysts have noted that fighting forces in Liberia have co-opted traditional rituals for their fighters for express purposes.Such initiation provides them with a sense of prestige as adults but also enhances a sense of loyalty to their fighting groups instead of to their society and community.[62]\n",
      "\n",
      "Boys who spoke with Human Rights Watch researchers were reticent to speak of the exact practices that made up initiation, but would display the scars on their bodies and the charms they wore, describing the magic involved.One fighter from LURD explained, \"These marks on my chest, they were put there to make me safe from bullets.This way, bullets would bounce off me.Once they were put there, I felt fine.\"[63] Another fighter from government forces described his scars, \"For protection, they would put marks, three or four slashes, on your arms and legs.Then they would rub gun powder into the marks or use a special leaf.This was done so that the bullets wouldn't get you, it really worked.\"[64]\n",
      "\n",
      "Some children did not display visible scars, but carried rings and charms.Seventeen-year-old Isaac T. explained:\"During the fighting, I was given a charm to wear around my neck, this was from a healer.In my dialect it is called a bang, this would protect me from bullets.It really worked, not against the shells but against the bullets.\"[65]According to the children, charms could not be worn when having sexual relations or in other situations because then the magic would not work and you risked being killed.[66]\n",
      "\n",
      "Children were additionally supplied with drugs such as opiates and marijuana, as well as tablets that they were not always able to identify.While many voluntarily smoke and drank and actively sought out liquor, the drugs were often supplied by their commanders.\n",

Sometimes we cut you with a razor blade and put medicine inside and then nothing can happen to you.We smoke grass, cigarettes, dugee (tablets), cokis (mashed tablets in a powder). It all makes you brave to go on the front. The commanders give it out. When you take the tablets you can't sleep, it makes you hot in your body. Anytime you go on the frontline, they give it to you. Just got to do something to be strong because you don't want the feeling of killing someone. You need the drugs to give you the strength to kill. [70]\n",

      "The soldiers were terrible, they would kill civilians plenty. They accused them of not supporting them and helping the enemy.We would steal clothes, food, money whatever we could find from civilians.

      "Many of the children who fought with the armed forces in and around Monrovia have been released or they themselves have simply abandoned their groups.Some have returned to their families; many more are languishing on the streets in the capital and other towns or in internally displaced camps.Children who spoke with Human Rights Watch investigators are waiting for demobilization programs to begin and eventual relocation to their families and communities.Some have received limited humanitarian assistance in the camps, but the majority are not currently assisted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other children are still involved with the fighting forces despite a commitment in the Ghana Peace Agreement to release all abductees.[76]Displaced persons from Bong County described child soldiers with government militias based in Sanyoie continuing to loot and steal from the local population.Underage fighters still make up the rank and file of MODEL in counties under their control and were involved in active combat during an offensive in Nimba County in November 2003.In a visit to Tubmanburg in October, boys with the LURD were visibly manning checkpoints on the road between Monrovia and Bomi.One young guard told researchers he was eleven years old and had been with LURD for two years.[77]\n",
      "\n",
      "A demobilization program, which includes provisions for child soldiers, began on December 8 but was soon postponed until January 20 due to the overwhelming numbers of fighters who presented themselves for the program, lack of advance information on the benefits included and a general un-preparedness by U.N. officials.The successful demobilization of all forces is contingent on countrywide deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.At the time of writing, their numbers reached just under 7,000 of an intended size of 15,000 peacekeepers and their geographic scope was just beginning to expand beyond the greater Monrovia area.The continued abuse of children in the fighting forces underscores the urgency of U.N. deployment; children will continue to suffer from violations described above until the peacekeepers reach all areas of the country and demobilization can begin.\n",
      "\n",
      "The continued delay in programs also heightens the risk that some children will be recruited to fight in neighboring countries.A former child soldier living in a displaced persons camp had already been approached by his commander to go to another West African country to continue fighting.Although he refused, he stressed that with limited options available to him, such an offer was tempting.[78]Similarly, in Buchanan, some MODEL fighters may have already been sent back to Cte d'Ivoire to assist in that conflict and there is concern that as the war dies down in Liberia, children will fight in other West African states.[79]\n",

      "Official Response\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, officials from the fighting groups continue to deny their recruitment and use of child soldiers.In a June 2003 statement, LURD pledged to end the recruitment of child soldiers and demobilize those in their ranks.The declaration was not followed through with visible action on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch researchers met with LURD Chairman Sekou Conneh in October during a visit to Tubmanburg.According to the chairman, \"As for child soldiers, we have been at war a long time, some of them took up arms.But there was no training, no recruitment of any child.Some volunteered to help us with the arms, but they were not trained to fight with us, they were not given weapons by us.Some of these children would follow our soldiers, but we sent them away.\"[80]\n",
      "\n",
      "In an interview in September, Defense Minister Daniel Chea also denied the government's use of child soldiers.\"We have no child soldiers except in one or two cases where local commanders have received young volunteers eager to defend their country.We have a strict policy against using child soldiers and we follow it.\"[81]\n",
      "\n",
      "From the testimonies of dozens of children interviewed for this report as well as the visible use of children at checkpoints in the country, such denials do not reflect the reality that children were actively and forcibly conscripted in the fighting in Liberia.The children themselves were able to give credible testimonies about the use and recruitment of child soldiers by many of the top commanders in the fighting forces, despite international law prohibiting their use.Some of these same commanders presently hold key positions in the national transitional government of Liberia, complicating future questions of accountability for their violations against children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal Standards\n",
      "\n",
      "The government of Liberia, LURD and MODEL are all in violation of international standards that prohibit the use of children as soldiers.Further, Liberia is a party to the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, which together with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, obligates states to provide for the protection, care, and recovery of child victims of conflict, including child soldiers.Finally, Liberia has recently ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which stipulates that states shall make primary education compulsory and free to all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Liberia acceded to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 in 1954 and to Protocol II in 1988 which together make up the body of international humanitarian law.The Conventions accord special protection to children in armed conflict.Protocol II to the Geneva Convention forbids the use of child soldiers under the age of fifteen in internal armed conflict.[82]This Protocol is binding on state parties and armed opposition groups as well.Government forces, LURD and MODEL are all in violation of their obligations under the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocol II.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child also forbids the participation of children under fifteen years of age in hostilities.Article 38 of the convention prohibits the recruitment of children under the age of fifteen while Article 39 obliges that state parties take appropriate measures, \"to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of. . .armed conflicts.\"[83]\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, other international standards have been adopted that strengthen protections for children affected by armed conflict.These standards reflect a growing international awareness that children under the age of eighteen should not participate in armed conflict.Human Rights Watch takes the position that no child under the age of eighteen should be recruited-either voluntarily or forcibly-into any armed forces or groups, or participate in hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, states pledge to take all necessary measures to ensure that no child takes part in hostilities and to refrain from recruiting children.The charter defines a child as every human being below the age of eighteen years.Liberia signed and ratified the charter in 1990.It further states that \"Parties. . .shall take all feasible measures to ensure the care and protection of children who are affected by armed conflicts.\"[84]\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations General Assembly adopted an Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict in May 2000.Although Liberia has yet to ratify the protocol, like the African Charter, it raises the standards set in the Convention on the Rights of the Child by establishing eighteen as the minimum age for any conscription or forced recruitment.It further calls on armed groups distinct from state forces not to recruit or use in hostilities persons under the age of eighteen and on other state parties to assist with rehabilitation where possible.Human Rights Watch urges the new Liberian Government to sign and ratify this important protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2003, Liberia ratified the Statute for the International Criminal Court.The statue defines the recruitment or use of children under fifteen as a war crime whether carried out by members of the government or non-governmental forces.As late as November 2003, children under the age of fifteen were still active in some fighting units of MODEL, LURD and government forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in October 2003, Liberia ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Together with the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child and the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, Liberia has recognized the right of the child to the highest attainable standard of education.The new government should prioritize education, both for child soldiers and all children affected by the conflict, to ensure its compliance with its recognition to achieve free and compulsory primary education.[85]\n",

      "The Future for Child Soldiers in Liberia\n",
      "\n",
      "As previously noted, plans to begin a comprehensive demobilization program were postponed following problems at the initial demobilization site which opened in Monrovia on December 8, 2003.At the time of writing, the demobilization program is scheduled to re-open on January 20, 2004 in Monrovia, with other sites to open in the countryside contingent upon UNMIL troops reaching full strength and deploying throughout Liberia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Child soldiers are to benefit from demobilization plans; they will be separated from adults within a 72-hour period of arriving at the sites and will receive benefits as former combatants.According to UNICEF staff working with the Disarmament, Demobilization, Rehabilitation and Reintegration (DDRR) Program, children will pass through one of three demobilization sites in staggered periods from which they will proceed to established interim care centers.The centers are envisioned to provide space for children to distance themselves from their military past and to prepare for eventual reintegration into their home communities.Family tracing, counseling, medical care, and skills training are planned for the care centers provided by national and international organizations.Further support is to be provided to the children upon placement in their home communities, from six weeks to three months later.[86]\n",
      "\n",
      "Demobilization programs for children have been tried before in Liberia with limited success, in part due to the resumption of conflict which frustrated efforts at longer term rehabilitation. In a formal DDRR program that was established in 1997, fewer than one third of the estimated 15,000 children who had fought entered the program.Of these, only 78 were girls despite evidence that their numbers were considerably greater.[87]\n",
      "\n",
      "Agencies working with children in Monrovia are determined to improve on past attempts, drawing on lessons learned earlier in Liberia and from DDRR programs in neighboring Sierra Leone.The large presence of U.N. peacekeepers, currently deployed in the country for a projected two-year mission, is expected to create sufficient stability to complete community rehabilitation and reintegration.Admitting children with or without their commanders (children presented by their commanders has been a pre-requisite in past programs for admittance) and immediately separating children to interim care centers is expected to yield better results in terms of numbers and quality of programming.[88]\n",
      "\n",
      "Child care specialists and counselors who worked with previous programs remain concerned about two principal areas:the inclusion of girls and the longer term reintegration of children.In past programs, few girls benefited from the DDRR process despite the fact that many had been forced to join the fighting forces and were at the end of the war, separated from their families.They were either unaware of the program's existence or reluctant to identify themselves as fighters.In many cases, this left them with no other alternative than to remain with the commander or combatant who had abducted them in the first place. In a UNICEF report on past DDRR experiences in Liberia, recommendations for future programs include increased efforts to reach out to girls and to inform and include them in the process.[89]While more attention to girls in the DDRR process may increase their numbers in the program, many girls, especially younger ones, may fear negative stigmatization and may not want to be involved.Some specialists believe the only way to reach these girls is outside the formal DDRR program, through projects within their home communities where they can be assisted.In addition, working with all children affected by war in communities helps to diminish the perception that children who took up arms are being privileged or rewarded for their behavior.[90]\n",
      "\n",
      "Counselors who have worked with children in past DDRR programs also underlined the need for long-term programs that focus on community rehabilitation.They explained that in the past, money that was initially promised to help children was prematurely exhausted.As a result, many projects to build skills and provide basic education were never completed.After 1997, children were quickly placed in their communities but insufficient follow-up was done.In some families, problems between the children and their relatives or community members led to children being abandoned or running away.Coupons given to children to be redeemed for health care and education were useless; either because they were refused or because centers for such services did not exist.Liberians working at child care agencies stress that a successful program must include long-term provisions for assisting children with rehabilitation and that the community is the best place for programs.[91]\n",
      "\n",
      "For children who went through the past DDRR program, many told us that upon return to their home communities there was little help for them and they saw no alternative other than to take up arms again.Jeremy P. described his situation.\"After the first demobilization, I went to a trade school in Tubmanburg.But I could not complete the course.I was living on my own. I didn't have any financial support, so I dropped out of the school.\"[92]\n",

      "\n",
      "For one counselor who works with children, the key to successful reintegration lies in the community.\"These kids did not fall from the sky, they are Liberian children.They came from communities and they need to go back to the communities.But we need to look at factors which caused them to leave and take up arms in the first place.Beyond the warfare lies poverty, neglect and lack of opportunity.Perhaps the biggest disservice to children in Liberia is the failure of the state to provide education.\"[95]\n",

Yet, the presence of prohibitively high school fees makes primary education an impossibility for many children in Liberia today.In the past, families have paid over one hundred US dollars in fees per year to send a child to primary school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some former child soldiers had to drop out of school before the war, as they lacked the money to pay school fees and other associated costs such as uniforms and materials.Lack of any educational or vocational alternative was a reason given for which some of them took up arms in the first place.Child soldiers expressed their concern about future schooling and how they and their families could afford an education.\n",

      "Young people need education, some had their learning interrupted, others never stepped into a classroom.But where will they get the money for uniforms and school fees?Are these same young people going to be content to sit around when from their experience they can get things with fighting?If they are not given possibilities, they will fight here or go and fight in other countries. [96]\n",
      "\n",
      "One child rights specialist reported that, in a conversation with a military commander about child soldiers in Liberia, the officer declared that children with education, those that can read and write, are more difficult to recruit and are generally more questioning of authority.The key to fully integrating former child soldiers and breaking the cycle of future child recruitment in Liberia lies in education for all children.[97]\n",
      "\n",
      "The system of education in Liberia is in need of massive rehabilitation.Schools are in disrepair, teachers have not been paid, and books and supplies have been systematically looted.According to a deputy Minister at the Ministry of Education, more than half of the population of Liberia is illiterate and the burden of education on families is enormous.School fees and money for supplies, books, and other materials have recently been beyond the means of a majority of Liberians.[98]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the obstacles, the new government in Liberia, working with UNICEF, has committed itself to providing universal primary education.[99]Under the new program, school fees will be waived for the poorest children.According to this deputy, to make such a program successful, long term investment by the government and the international community in paying teachers' salary arrears, training new teachers and rebuilding schools will need to be substantial to make primary education for all a reality.[100]\n",
      "\n",
      "After years of warfare, Liberia's infrastructure lies in ruins, with roads, bridges, hospitals and municipal buildings destroyed and social services to the population non-existent.In his December 2003 report on Liberia to the Security Council, the Secretary-General stated that \"assessments confirmed reports of massive destruction and vandalizing of physical infrastructure, as well as the total collapse of basic social services in practically all parts of the country and in all social and economic sectors.\"[101]\n",
      "\n",
      "In a meeting with Human Rights Watch researchers, the US ambassador to Liberia also spoke of the devastation in the country and suggested that rebuilding the nation is linked to an ultimately successful rehabilitation program for former fighters.In his words, \"We need to extend our thinking on what encompasses DDRR, for the successful reintegration of combatants will require massive infrastructure remodeling, building roads, schools and clinics.\"[102]\n",
      "\n",
      "To embark on an ambitious rebuilding program and to guarantee the rights of children to primary education, Liberia will need significant, long-term assistance from the international community.The government of Liberia must fulfill its international obligations to provide social services to its people but remains in severe need of outside assistance.While it remains a daunting task, rebuilding communities and assisting all children affected by war remains the most effective method of ensuring that children do not take up arms again and that the rights of children in Liberia will be respected.\n",

John Kerry at his recent confirmation hearing to become U.S. secretary of state. \"And no nation is as committed to the cause of human rights as we are.\" This weekend, Kerry will have arguably his best opportunity to demonstrate that commitment to rights in an environment in which tough, effective and audible American diplomacy is needed: China.\n",

      "Chinese officials will no doubt have pressed hard to ensure that all discussions of human rights remain behind closed doors, a strategy Beijing employed during then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's and President Obama's first visits to China. While U.S. officials have in some circumstances delivered tough human rights messages to Beijing, all too often, senior U.S. officials' concerns about human rights remain inaudible to those who most need to hear them: activists and ordinary people struggling every day to protect their rights in China.\n",

      "Over the past decade, as China's economy grew to become the world's second largest and its international heft increased dramatically, the government made no comparable strides with respect to human rights protections.

      "Some of the government's most recent low-lights include the persecution of not just peaceful government critics but also their children and extended families. Not only does the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo remain in jail, his wife, Liu Xia, remains under utterly baseless house arrest in Bejiing; meanwhile, several relatives of Chen Guangcheng, the blind legal activist who sought refuge from persecution in the United States in 2012, continue to endure trumped-up legal charges and harassment in Shandong province.\n",

      "Rather than engage in an urgent discussion about what is driving Tibetans to self-immolate in protest at Chinese policies, authorities are prosecuting, arresting and jailing an ever growing number of Tibetans. To demonstrate that China was powerful enough to hunt its enemies beyond its borders, national television broadcast live from their cell the last hours of four Burmese alleged to have run drugs and killed Chinese sailors; the final frames showed the men being put into trucks that would take them to the execution grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet a growing number of people inside China are courageously challenging these and other abuses, including land seizures, forced evictions and abuses of power by corrupt cadres.

      "Human rights in China continue to be treated by visiting government leaders as a somehow uniquely neuralgic topic, largely because the Chinese government and constituencies in other countries perceive them to be so.

      "Re: Decreasing enforcement funding in FY 2019 DHS Appropriations bill\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader Pelosi:\n",
      "\n",
      "I write on behalf of Human Rights Watch to urge you to reduce funding for the administration’s wasteful and abusive immigration enforcement activities. Instead of passing a full-year spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) when the continuing resolution expires on December 7, we urge you to pass a clean, short-term continuing resolution without extra enforcement funds and allow the next Congress to debate the appropriate budget for DHS and crucially needed oversight measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch has documented serious failures by DHS to use existing resources under previous budgets in rights-respecting ways. Despite repeated reports by Human Rights Watch, other nongovernmental organizations, and the DHS’s own Inspector General, these problems continue to remain unaddressed. Increasing funding to an agency unable to remedy its past abuses will only exacerbate those problems. As a matter of responsible oversight, Congress should not increase funding in these areas without also addressing serious failings in border policy, immigration detention, and enforcement that lead to rights violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch has documented: failures by CBP to follow US law when apprehending asylum seekers at the border;[1] the separation and mistreatment of families traveling together to the US to seek asylum;[2] systemic failures in detention medical care that has contributed to preventable deaths;[3] transfers of immigrant detainees between far-flung detention centers in ways that interfere with their due process rights;[4] the abuse of transgender women in detention;[5] and widespread summary deportations of people who call the United States home—including mothers, fathers, and spouses of US citizens; [6] tax-paying employees; and respected community members—without giving them a chance for consideration of their deep and longstanding ties to the United States before removing them from the country. In addition, the media and other organizations have documented DHS’ harmful treatment of immigrants, including women [7]– particularly those who are pregnant[8] – in detention, DACA recipients,[9] domestic violence survivors,[10] and children.[11] Measures should be taken to rectify the structural causes of these abuses and the impunity that has generally attached to them, before any increase in appropriations towards enforcement activity is considered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The abuses that we and others have documented require enhanced oversight and greater attention to due process. We recognize that these activities may, in fact, require appropriation of funds. For example, ensuring due process rights may require allocating funds to hire immigration judges and provide know-your-rights services;[12] it may require ensuring counsel for noncitizens whose due process rights are threatened in immigration proceedings including vulnerable groups such as persons with mental disabilities;[13] it requires transparency in data collection and dissemination;[14] and in effective accountability mechanisms within DHS and its component agencies. However, without a clear commitment by this administration and this Congress to appropriate first to these types of activities, there should at the very least not be any increase in appropriations for enforcement and detention. ICE has not even complied with the reporting requirements from the FY 2018 appropriations bill; it should not be rewarded with more funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "We call on you to reject any increase in appropriations that will exacerbate serious rights violations in the existing immigration enforcement system, and instead to put forward appropriations that will enhance transparency, due process, accountability, and fair treatment of all people subject to DHS jurisdiction.\n",

      "(Geneva) – The Sri Lankan government should announce a time-bound plan to carry out its pledges to the United Nations Human Rights Council since October 2015, Human Rights Watch said today. At an interim update before the Council this week on progress towards fulfilment of its human rights commitments, UN member countries should press Sri Lanka to ensure justice and accountability for the tens of thousands of victims of the country’s brutal civil war.\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 30/1 by consensus in which Sri Lanka pledged to set up four transitional justice mechanisms to promote “justice, reconciliation and human rights” in the country. These included an accountability mechanism involving international judges, prosecutors, and investigators; a truth and reconciliation mechanism; an office of missing persons; and an office for reparations. Thus far only the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has been set up – just ahead of the current session in Geneva. The high commissioner for human rights, in a report to the Council, expressed similar concerns. The Council will discuss the high commissioner’s report this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Human Rights Council needs to make it clear to the Sri Lankan government that it expects it to stop playing games and start delivering on its commitments,” said John Fisher, Geneva director. “The Sri Lankan government needs to move beyond pre-session PR and present a meaningful and concrete plan to deliver results for the victims who have been awaiting justice for far too long.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch welcomed the December action by the government to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT).\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating the Office of Missing Persons, while a positive step, is just the latest body set up in Sri Lanka to look into enforced disappearances. Reports of prior government-established commissions, some of which have been made public in recent years, have not led to accountability.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The Office of Missing Persons now represents their last best hope to learn the fate of their loved ones,” said Fisher. “It must do its work quickly and properly. Families of the disappeared have appeared before commission after commission, and many have camped out in the open over the past year in protest of government inaction.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The justice and accountability mechanism in the 2015 resolution is a key demand from victims and families affected by Sri Lanka’s 27-year civil war between the government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Both sides to the conflict, which ended in May 2009 with a decisive government victory, committed serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including extrajudicial killings, deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, enforced disappearances, and torture. The government should publicly set out when this mechanism will be set up instead of hiding behind various politically expedient excuses, Human Rights Watch said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government has also failed to deliver on its other pledges under the 2015 resolution. A government-commissioned task force led by independent activists carried out a nationwide consultation down to the grass-roots level and delivered a detailed report on the expectations of victims and affected communities. However, the report and its recommendations have languished and it is unclear whether the government will take them into account in either the Office of Missing Persons or the other transitional justice mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key outstanding pledge, namely security sector reform including the repeal of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), also remains unfulfilled. Sri Lanka has a long history of abuses by security forces, both during and after the civil war. The security forces have long used the PTA to detain suspects for years without charge, facilitating torture and other mistreatment. The government’s claims to be working on repealing and replacing the PTA with a rights-respecting law have yet to come to fruition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Sri Lanka’s state of emergency laws and regulations under the Public Security Ordinance (PSO) create a legal framework for abuse by the security forces in the name of national security interests. The government recently resorted to emergency rule in response to anti-Muslim riots in the Kandy district. The government was largely successful in quelling the riots, arresting dozens of people suspected of instigating and participating in the violence, but the episode highlighted the lack of action in limiting the PSO’s broad powers. The government had pledged to review these regulations under Resolution 30/1 but they still permit the authorities to detain people for up to 14 days before being produced in court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A lack of justice and impunity for past abuses fuels current abuses in Sri Lanka,” Fisher said. “The government’s delay in undertaking promised reforms is a slap in the face to the victims and their families who have waited for years for answers. The government should stop hiding behind politically expedient excuses and act on its pledges.”\n",

      "(New York) - The US veto of a proposed United Nations Security Council Resolution calling upon Israel to end illegal policies that promote settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, undermines enforcement of international law, Human Rights Watch said today. The Geneva Conventions, to which Israel is a party, prohibit the transfer of a country's civilian population into territory it occupies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"President Obama wants to tell the Arab world in his speeches that he opposes settlements, but he won't let the Security Council tell Israel to stop them in a legally binding way,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 explicitly prohibits an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into occupied territory. Notwithstanding this ban, almost half-a-million Jewish Israelis with Israeli government support have moved into settlements it has constructed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, and formally annexed occupied territory in East Jerusalem, a move not recognized by any other government in the world. The International Court of Justice in a 2004 advisory opinion noted the widely-accepted view that the Geneva Conventions not only prohibit forced population transfers, \"but also any measures taken by an occupying Power in order to organize or encourage transfers of parts of its own population into the occupied territory.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Israeli settlement policies also violate international human rights prohibitions against discrimination. Human Rights Watch recently documented Israel's two-tier system for the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish populations in the 60 percent of West Bank area that Israel controls and in East Jerusalem. Israeli policies deliberately withhold basic services from Palestinians, causing tremendous hardships by preventing and punishing the construction of homes and infrastructure for their communities, while providing generous financial benefits and infrastructure for Jewish settlements. Such differential treatment lacks any security rationale, but is meted out on the prohibited basis of race, ethnicity, and national origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "UN sources told Human Rights Watch that the US government attempted to persuade the Palestinian Authority to forgo a vote on the resolution by offering to support a statement from the Security Council president condemning settlements as \"illegitimate,\" instead of clearly identifying them as \"illegal,\" as provided in the resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a party to the Geneva Conventions, the United States is obligated \"to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The US government's opposition to accurate language in the Security Council resolution erodes the unified international message that Israel should change its settlement policies,\" Whitson said. \"What's needed from the Obama administration is a clear and consistent message that settlements on occupied territory are illegal and must be dismantled.\"\n",

      "What’s the best Mother’s Day gift New York state lawmakers could give? Paid family leave, guaranteed under state law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia, a mom in Ithaca, adopted a baby born four months premature. Her daughter was on oxygen and a heart monitor for months, and needed almost daily medical checks. Julia’s employer let her take some accrued sick leave to manage her daughter’s care, but she had no paid family leave. Samantha, from New York City, gave birth by caesarean section and had an infected, painful wound when she resumed work eight weeks later. She had little sick leave, no paid family leave, and couldn’t afford more unpaid time to recover.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia and Samantha are two of more than 60 parents I interviewed for a 2011 Human Rights Watch report (updated in 2015) on the negative impacts of the lack of paid family leave under law in the US. The parents I interviewed, including many New Yorkers, recounted how short and unpaid leave from work after childbirth or adoption contributed to delaying immunizations and health visits for babies, postpartum depression and other health problems for mothers, and early cessation of breastfeeding. During unpaid leave, many went into debt, and some had to resort to public assistance and bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some US workers can take unpaid job-protected leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act to manage their or their family members’ serious health conditions and to bond with new children. But this law doesn’t protect nearly half the workforce, and many who are eligible cannot afford to take unpaid leave. Only 12 percent of private industry workers have paid family leave benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The US is an extreme outlier in failing to guarantee national paid family leave. A 2014 International Labor Organization report found that out of 185 countries, only the United States and Papua New Guinea lack paid leave for new mothers under law. Paid paternity leave for fathers is also on the rise, with 71 countries guaranteeing it. Some countries have additional paid parental leave, and many offer paid leave to handle family health crises.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, New York state lawmakers are starting to pay attention to how the lack of paid family leave harms workers, businesses, and the economy. Most of today’s workers will have family caregiving responsibilities at some point, whether for aging parents, a sick partner, a newborn baby, or others.\n",
      "\n",
      "An important bill is moving through the New York State Assembly and Senate to establish a paid family leave insurance program. This bill would provide workers in New York with up to 12 weeks of paid leave per year to bond with a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or address certain issues arising from military service. Workers would receive two-thirds of their average weekly wage while on leave, up to a cap. The benefit would be financed solely through employee payroll deductions of up to 45 cents per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like other US states that have family leave insurance programs (California, New Jersey, and Rhode Island), New York has a temporary disability insurance system. This system could readily be adapted to administer paid family leave insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Research from several US states and many other countries shows that family leave insurance is good for employers, the economy, public health, and equality. Paid family leave increases business productivity and reduces turnover costs. It also decreases infant mortality, increases immunization rates, lowers risk of postpartum depression, and increases breastfeeding duration. A 190-country survey of work-family policies, including family leave, found that countries guaranteeing various forms of paid family leave had high levels of economic competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia and Samantha saw first-hand how the lack of paid family leave hurts working families. In addition to suffering pain as she returned to work, Samantha stopped breastfeeding earlier than she wished, as she had nowhere to pump breastmilk at work. She went into debt and defaulted on credit cards while she had no pay. Julia’s employer offered some flexibility, but she suffered extreme stress as she rationed her sick time down to the hour for her daughter’s care. Julia held off on addressing her own serious illness in remission, as she could not afford unpaid leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "I caught up with Julia a few years after our interview, and she said her daughter was thriving and learning to read. I hope she can soon read a headline declaring that New York lawmakers have passed the paid family leave bill.\n",

      "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "The Croatian government has taken steps to correct some of the abuses of human rights that had marked Croatia's first two years of independence, but violations of civil and political rights by reason of ethnic identity and political dissent continue.1 On February 13, 1992, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki (formerly Helsinki Watch) sent a letter to Croatian President Franjo Tudjman delineating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Croatia during 1990 and 1991.2 This report describes the status of civil and political rights in Croatia since then. This report does not address violations of the rules of war perpetrated by Croatian and Serbian armed forces in Croatia nor does it address the situation of human rights in Serbian-controlled areas of Croatia. Both subjects have been addressed in previous Human Rights Watch/Helsinki reports and will be addressed in forthcoming reports. Furthermore, this report does not deal with violations by Croatian or Bosnian Croat forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina, which Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has documented and will continue to report.3 However, this report addresses the treatment of Bosnian refugees living in Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the behavior of the police force improved, and physical attacks against Serbs and their property had declined from late 1992 to 1994, police abuse and attacks against Serbs and their property have increased in 1995, primarily in relation to recent military offensives that re-captured the formerly Serb-controlled areas of western Slavonia and Krajina.4 The government continues to impedefreedom of the press and expression. Although Croatia's Interior Ministry has taken steps to check abusive behavior of the police, the behavior of the military police has worsened dramatically in the past three years. Indeed, organs of the Defense Ministry are responsible for many of the human rights abuses in Croatia today. The Ministry of Defense has repeatedly refused to respect the judgments of the courts, and members of the Croatian Army and military police show increasing disdain for the rule of law and the civilian authorities. Gojko _u_ak, Croatia's Defense Minister, and Mate Lau_i_, the chief of Croatia's military police, have not taken serious steps to correct the behavior of Croatia's military police. Although domestic human rights organizations, opposition politicians and some members of the Croatian government and ruling Croatian Democratic Union (Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica - HDZ) have publicly protested against the behavior of Croatia's Defense Ministry, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has not taken firm steps to correct abusive behavior within branches of his government.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some instances, abuses of civil and political rights in Croatia are indirectly or directly associated with the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Continued tensions between Croatian and Serbian forces in parts of Croatia, rebel Serbian control of one-third of Croatia's territory and fighting between Muslims and Croats in Bosnia in 19935 has been accompanied by animosity, harassment and discrimination against Serbs, Muslims and other non-Croats who are law-abiding citizens of Croatia. Refusal of citizenship, job dismissals and other forms of discrimination have socially, economically and politically marginalized thousands of non-Croats who have lived in Croatia for many years or decades. Lack offree broadcast media sources and harassment of the independent press has served to perpetuate inter-ethnic tensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "· Some Serbs, former Yugoslav Army (Jugoslavenska Narodna Armija -JNA) personnel and others continue to be forcibly evicted from their respective homes, usually without respect to the persons' right to due process and often with the acquiescence of the local authorities and Croatia's Ministry of Defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The influx of Bosnian Croat refugees from central Bosnia who were displaced by Bosnian government and Muslim forces in 1993 was followed by the worsening treatment of Bosnian Muslim refugees living in Croatia at that time.\n",
      "\n",
      "· The prolonged war has resulted in lax discipline among Croatian Army troops and the military police, who are largely responsible for most abuses perpetrated against persons in detention. There is little evidence of efforts to check abuses by these military forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other instances, violations of civil and political rights are associated with Croatia's communist past and its status as a republic of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Socijalisti...ka Federativna Republika Jugoslavia -SFRJ). Claiming that Croatia is in transition from a socialist to a capitalist economy, the Croatian government has sometimes used this as justification for deliberately hampering the development of a genuinely free press in Croatia through a variety of mechanisms. The granting of citizenship has been denied arbitrarily to some non-Croats, despite the fact that these persons have lived in Croatia for decades. The ownership of property which formerly had belonged to Yugoslavia's communist party, the Yugoslav Army or other federal organs of the former SFRJ was transferred to the Croatian government, which then arbitrarily forced the eviction from their state-owned homes of persons formerly affiliated with organs of the previous regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "To its credit, the Croatian government continues to cooperate with international and to a lesser extent, domestic human rights groups and delegations concerned about human rights in Croatia. In March 1993, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the Special Rapporteur for the Former Yugoslavia of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, established a field office in Zagreb. Local and national government officials - including high-ranking members of the Croatian government - frequently meet with human rights activists to discuss theirgrievances. International and domestic human rights groups are generally allowed to function without direct government interference in Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. CITIZENSHIP\n",
      "\n",
      "GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND INTERNATIONAL LAW\n",
      "\n",
      "Citizenship determines the enjoyment of certain fundamental civil and political rights, as well as being a precondition for the receipt of welfare benefits and other government entitlements on which many depend for their livelihood. International law gives states great - though not unlimited - freedom in setting requirements for citizenship. According to article 1 of the 1930 Hague Convention on Certain Questions Relating to the Conflict of Nationality Laws:\n",
      "\n",
      "it is for each state to determine under its own law who are citizens ... [but] the citizenship law of a State shall be recognized by other states only insofar as it is consistent with international conventions, international customs and the principles of law generally recognized with regard to citizenship.6\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the precedent of the 1930 Hague Convention on Nationality, article 1(3) of the 1965 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) states that:\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing in this Convention may be interpreted as affecting in any way the legal provisions of State parties concerning nationality, citizenship or naturalization, provided that such provisions do not discriminate against any particular community.7\n",
      "\n",
      "Max van der Stoel, the High Commissioner on National Minorities of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has recommended that, \"in view of articles 1(3) and 5(d) of the CERD, any discrimination on the ground of nationality or ethnicity should be avoided when enacting orimplementing legal provisions concerning nationality, citizenship or naturalization.\"8\n",
      "\n",
      "The Council of Europe has also stated that \"citizenship should not be granted arbitrarily and in violation of the principle of non-discrimination, a rule found in most human rights treaties.\"9 The Council recognized that article 15(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights grants everyone the right to citizenship and states that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his or her citizenship.10 The Council also points out that children have the right to acquire citizenship under article 24(3) of the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 7(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.11 All of these legal principles are aimed at avoiding statelessness among the world's population, a condition which the 1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness seek to abolish.12\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the general principles set forth by the international community and regional European bodies, international law does not address the issue of citizenship in detail. For this reason, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has adopted a position identifying principles that we believe should be embodied in new citizenship laws and proposals.13 We believe that the newly formed states that have emerged from the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRJ) have an obligation to adopt and apply citizenship laws that treat in a fair and non-discriminatory manner individuals who moved to or otherwise lived in therespective republics of the SFRJ when it was a unified state.14 Unfortunately, citizenship laws and proposals in some of the republics of the former SFRJ - including Croatia - have been applied in ways that discriminate against ethnic and national groups which are not the majority group in the respective republic.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted, however, that following domestic and international crticism, the Croatian government sometimes reversed earlier denials of citizenship to non-Croats who were long-term residents of Croatia. In general, reports concerning the denial of citizenship based solely on the applicant's ethnicity declined in 1994, but denial of citizenship to Serbs who remained in formerly Serb-held areas of western Slavonia and Krajina in mid-1995 have recently been reported and may be a problem in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRITERIA FOR FAIRNESS\n",
      "\n",
      "Citizenship laws in newly independent states should be evaluated by two dependent sets of criteria: first, whether the law refrains from treating as immigrants certain individuals who lived on the state's territory before the declaration of independence;15 and second, if the law does treat such individuals as immigrants, by the qualifications according to which the former may accede to or be denied citizenship. Such qualifications typically include minimum residence requirements, language proficiency, and proof of legal source of income. They also sometimes include medical, political, and financial grounds upon which a group of individuals could be excluded from citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most liberal citizenship law is the \"zero option,\" which grants citizenship to all people living in the republic either at the time independence was declared or when the law was adopted. It generally sets out a certain period during which individuals either may apply for citizenship or automatically become citizens provided they do not officially reject citizenship in a given state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki views with concern various laws and proposals under consideration in states of the former SFRJ that could exclude fromcitizenship in the state in question many individuals with significant links to that state. Those excluded are individuals who, while the SFRJ was a unified state, took up residence in a former Yugoslav republic that did not coincide with his or her ethno-national identity and now find themselves resident in a new state in which their ethnicity/nationality is not the dominant one. We believe that most individuals who migrated from one republic to another could not have foreseen the change in the SFRJ's political status and that they lived in any given republic with the expectation that their residence would not be interrupted by the issue of their citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes that the denial of citizenship to persons who have extensive social and cultural ties to the community but who are members of the minority population in each of the respective republics of the former SFRJ is discriminatory against the minority group in question. It also leads to the social and economic marginalization of the minority population, forcing people to leave one republic and emigrate to a republic in which they would be part of the majority but which they do not otherwise consider their home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Denial of Croatian citizenship to some Serbs, Muslims and members of other ethnic groups renders them illegal aliens in their own country. Denying citizenship to deserving individuals would violate their voting rights guaranteed in Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Moreover, the allocation of property and other social and economic rights often hinges upon citizenship. Citizenship laws that exclude otherwise deserving individuals would create categories of people whose civil and political rights would be routinely violated and whose eligibility for medical, welfare, educational and other benefits would be denied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Serbs who fled from western Slavonia and Krajina during or after the Croatian Army offensives in these areas in May and August 1995 may at some point in the future want to return to Croatia. The Croatian government should not unnecessarily hamper these Serbs' applications for Croatian citizenship, if they choose to apply for such status and return to their homes in Croatia in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "CROATIA'S LAW ON CITIZENSHIP AND ITS APPLICATION\n",
      "\n",
      "After Croatia seceded from the SFRJ in 1991, all residents in Croatia were required to apply for a \"domovnica,\" which certifies a person's Croatian citizenship. The Ministry of Interior is responsible for granting citizenship, which is regulatedby the Law on Croatian Citizenship.16 The law specifies the conditions a person must meet before he or she is granted citizenship. Although the \"zero option\" generally has been applied to ethnic Croats from Croatia, non-Croats - and to a lesser extent, Croats from other former SFRJ republics - must meet more stringent criteria if they are to receive citizenship. The Croatian citizenship law does not adequately take into account the fact that Croatia was once part of the SFRJ and that many of Croatia's long-time residents do not qualify for citizenship under the new law because they are neither Croats by ethnicity nor were they born in Croatia.17\n",
      "\n",
      "The granting of citizenship in Croatia has been marred by long delays, ethnic discrimination, arbitrary decisions and a lack of fair and consistent procedure founded in law. Since mid-1992, the government's administrative organs have taken steps to reverse decisions that arbitrarily denied many people Croatian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-Croats who have lived in Croatia for decades do not automatically receive citizenship. A child of Croatian parents who was born and raised in Canada and has never visited Croatia can more easily obtain Croatian citizenship than can a Serb, Muslim or Albanian who was born in a one of the other republics of the former SFRJ but has lived in Croatia for decades. The denial of citizenship to long-term residents of Croatia who are not of Croatian nationality arbitrarily strips such persons of rights they had previously enjoyed. The former Special Rapporteur for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights for the former Yugoslavia18 has rightly pointed out the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "The Croatian authorities have repeatedly justified the policy of ethnic differentiation in the conferment of citizenship by comparing Croatian legislation with the legislation of other States which they say make similar distinctions on the basis of descent. It is, however, imperative to distinguish the citizenship law of a State dealing with immigration under ordinary circumstances, where the applicant may have no social attachment to the territory concerned, as opposed to a new State where denial of citizenship on the basis of ethnic or national origin affects those who have previously enjoyed citizenship of the predecessor State and lawful residence on the territory concerned.19\n",
      "\n",
      "The Croatian government has defended its decision to deny some non-Croats and those not born in Croatia citizenship. The Croatian government has claimed that each of the former SFRJ republics should be allowed to decide whether or not to grant citizenship to former SFRJ citizens living in the republic in question and that this matter should be settled by bilateral agreements between the states of the former SFRJ.20 This pre-supposes that a person denied citizenship in one republic could obtain citizenship in another republic of the former SFRJ. While this may be a valid assertion in many cases, such an approach does not take into account the residency, ownership of property and family ties of the person in question. For example, a Serb born in Serbia in the 1940s who had emigrated to and lived in Croatia since the 1950s could be denied Croatian citizenship and granted Serbian citizenship, despite the fact that all his or her personal and professional ties are in Croatia, not in Serbia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those persons who have been denied Croatian citizenship but otherwise have lived, worked and owned property in Croatia for most of their adult lives are now considered illegally employed and ineligible for welfare benefits and pensions, and their ownership of property is precarious. They cannot be employed in the civilservice and are not always entitled to the medical services or free education available to citizens. Given their precarious residency and socio-economic status, such persons - most frequently non-Croats - are forced to leave Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Employment Law for Foreigners requires that all non-Croatian citizens obtain a work permit in order to work in Croatia. Those persons denied Croatian citizenship who are not granted work permits can be dismissed from their jobs, despite the fact that they may have been employed in a given enterprise for many years. The Croatian government has on at least four occasions extended the date by which persons were to apply for work permits or risk dismissal from their jobs. The Central Employment Agency in Zagreb decides in each case whether a person is to obtain a work permit. According to Croatian law, a work permit can only be issued to a foreigner if he or she retains specific qualifications which cannot otherwise be filled from among Croatia's citizens. The high unemployment rate among Croats who have citizenship is a factor in government decisions to grant work permits to non-Croats who do not possess Croatian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki interviewed scores of people - almost exclusively non-Croats - who had lived in Croatia for more than the past ten years but still were refused citizenship, often without reason. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki retains copies of more than sixty notices issued by the Ministry of Interior in Zagreb in which the applicants' requests for Croatian citizenship were denied. Most of those denied citizenship were born in one of the republics of the former SFRJ other than Croatia. Articles 8 and 26 of the Croatian citizenship law are most frequently cited as justification for the denial of citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The denial of citizenship is based on allegations that the person did not meet the requirements set forth in Article 8, clause 1, of the citizenship law which states:\n",
      "\n",
      "Croatian citizenship may be acquired by assimilation by a foreigner who submitted the application for Croatian citizenship and fulfills the following conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. That he [or she] has reached 18 years of age and is able to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. That he [or she] is permitted to give up his [or her] foreign citizenship, or that he [or she] has proof that this permit will be given in case he [or she] is granted Croatian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      ". . .\n",
      "\n",
      "4. That he [or she] is familiar with the Croatian language and Latin alphabet.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. That it can be assumed from his [or her] behavior that he [or she] respects the laws and customs of the Republic of Croatia and that he [or she] accepts Croatian culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "When point 521 of Article 8 is cited as justification for rejection of citizenship, the rejection notice does not specifically state how an applicant's behavior reflects disrespect for the laws, customs and culture of Croatia. The clause is ambiguous and open to misuse and the application of subjective criteria to deny a person citizenship. In cases of rejection under Article 8, the rejected applicant can initiate administrative proceedings before the Administrative Court of Croatia within thirty days after receipt of the rejection notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 10 of the law allows for a foreign citizen to become a Croatian citizen if he or she is married to a Croatian citizen and has been granted permanent residency on the territory of Croatia. However, in many cases, some members of a family are granted citizenship while others are not. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki spoke to many such families in the past three years. The following scenario is typical. Jelena,22 a Croatian woman, and Zvonimir, one of her two sons who was born in Zagreb, apply for and receive Croatian citizenship. However, Haris, her Bosnian-born Muslim husband, and Du_an, her other son who was born in Serbia, are denied citizenship despite the fact that they have spent most of their adult lives and childhoods in Croatia. In such cases, families are in danger of being separated, given the illegal status of some of their members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others have applied for citizenship but have not been informed of a decision for months and in some cases over one year, leaving them uncertain about their status in Croatia. In other instances, persons who have fled or originally are from rebel Serbian-controlled areas of Croatia cannot travel to these areas to obtain their birth certificates and other identity and residency documents. Without such documents, some people have been refused Croatian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still others who do not have or have been denied Croatian citizenship have been expelled from the country. Z.L., a Serbian resident of Split, was issued a notice by the division of administrative affairs of the police in Split. According to the police notice, the residency of Z.L., \"a citizen of Serbia,\" was revoked. The notice stated that Z.L. was to leave Croatia by May 5, 1993, and that he did not have the right to return until May 5, 1995.23 The notice stated that Z.L.'s residency in Croatia was being revoked at the request of the division for operative affairs of the Split police, which cited article 42, clause 1(3) of Croatia's Law on the Movement and Residency of Foreigners as justification for the request.24 Z.L.'s expulsion may have been a consequence of his having lodged a complaint against the military, after soldiers broke into his apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Z.L. had a right to appeal the decision, which his lawyer did on April 1, 1993. According to the lawyer's appeal, Z.L. had lived in Croatia since 1964 and worked at the police station until 1987, when he retired. His deceased wife was a Croat and his two daughters were born and continue to reside in Split. All of Z.L.'s immediate relatives in Split are Croats. Despite the fact that Z.L. considers Croatia to be his home and has lived there for twenty-nine of his fifty-eight years, he was expelled from Croatia.25\n",
      "\n",
      "The citizenship law does not adequately set out the procedures that the Ministry of Interior must follow in accepting or rejecting a person's application for citizenship. In many instances, the decision as to whether or not a person's application will be denied is made at the whim of the issuing administrative officer at the local police station. Particularly in cases where the person is a long-time resident of Croatia but is not a Croat by ethnicity, the denial or granting of citizenship has been arbitrarily decided. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki spoke to some individuals who, after having been denied citizenship, complained to a higherofficial. In some cases, the superior officer overturned the decision of the administrative personnel, claiming that the administrative officer had no grounds to deny the applicant citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Croatia established at least three alien reception centers where people who received expulsion or banishment orders, whose residence permits had been revoked or who resided without the authorization of Croatia but have not been expelled are detained pursuant to the Law on the Movement and Residence of Aliens.26 Those held in the Dugo Selo center near Zagreb did not receive a judicial or administrative decision confining them to the center for a specified period of time.27 According to the Office for Migration in the Interior Ministry, an alien is assigned to an alien reception center in the absence of an agreement with the embassy of the country of which the alien is a citizen to transfer him or her to that country.28 However, some of the aliens in the reception centers are not citizens of another country, but citizens of the former SFRJ who had been living in Croatia for many years with members of their family and real property, but had been denied Croatian citizenship.29\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 24, 1993, Croatia's Constitutional Court examined challenges and revisions to the citizenship law proposed by a variety of opposition political parties. In its ruling, the court did not support a broad interpretation of the law which would have been more favorable to non-Croats applying for citizenship. However, it did rule that Article 26 of the citizenship law - which allowed the Ministry of Interior to deny citizenship to an applicant who otherwise met the legally prescribed requirements needed for the acquisition of citizenship - allowed the Ministry of Interior to deny citizenship without reason and that such action was unconstitutional. Article 26, which may have been intended to address exceptional cases involving national security questions, had been used to deny scores of non-Croats Croatian citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Croatia's Constitutional Court ruled that the Interior Ministry had to define the circumstances under which the granting of citizenship to an applicant would be detrimental to the interests of Croatia by defining what it considered to be \"the interests of the state.\" The Court pointed to Article 206(3) of Croatia's Law on General Administrative Procedure which requires that all written judgements must give a reason for the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 8, 1993, the Constitutional Court again examined the citizenship law and struck down Article 26 altogether. The Court stated that persons denied citizenship were guaranteed the right to appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Constitutional Court's decision may mitigate the arbitrariness of the Interior Ministry's decision-making process, the Court did not directly address the ability of the Defense Ministry to reject an applicant's request for citizenship without reason. Article 32 of Croatia's citizenship law states that \"military matters concerning Croatian citizenship are dealt with by the Minister of Defense.\" The law fails to define or cite examples of \"military matters concerning Croatian citizenship,\" nor does the law specify whether a person has a right to appeal the Defense Ministry's decision if his or her application for citizenship is denied in such a case. It is unclear whether the December 1993 judgment of Croatia's Constitutional Court guaranteeing persons the right to an appeal is afforded to those denied citizenship by the Defense Ministry. Although the Defense Ministry rarely engages in citizenship questions, in the absence of court instructions similar to those issued for the Interior Ministry, the vague reference to \"military matters concerning Croatian citizenship\" in Article 32 leaves a loophole through which an application for citizenship can still be arbitrarily denied by the state.\n",

      "III. TREATMENT OF SERBS AND OTHER MINORITIES IN CROATIA30\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct attacks against Serbs and their property in Croatia generally decreased between 1992 and early 1995. This was due, in part, to the fact that fierce fighting between Serbian and Croatian forces in Croatia subsided following the establishment of a ceasefire and the nominal acceptance of the Vance plan in January 1992.31 Attacks against Serbs also decreased during that period because many Serbs had left Croatian government-controlled areas, and those that remained were sometimes considered to be \"loyal\" to, or to have accepted the authority of, the Croatian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, following the re-capture of the so-called Krajina region from rebel Serbian authorities in August 1995, Croatian soldiers have burned Serbian villages and destroyed property belonging to Serbs. As of mid-August 1995, these crimes apparently are being conducted with impunity and appear aimed at preventing the return of those Serbs who had lived in the area but who fled during the offensive. Following the re-capture of the western Slavonia area in May 1995, Croatian forces harassed, threatened and robbed Serbs who chose to remain in the area. Persons held in detention also were beaten or otherwise mistreated following their capture.32 Graves containing the remains of those killed during the fightinghave yet to be exhumed by independent forensic experts and the identities of all those killed during the offensive have yet to be released by the Croatian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Federal election law provides for the representation of all minorities in parliament,33 with proportional representation guaranteed for any minority that comprises more than 8 percent of the population.34 According to the 1991 census, Serbs comprised approximately 11.5 percent of the population in Croatia and were the only non-Croatian ethnic group in Croatia that met the 8 percent criteria for parliamentary representation.35 Thirteen of the 138 seats in House of Representatives of Croatia's parliament were allotted to members of Croatia's Serbian population.36 The Federal Election Commission designated thirteen Serbsto \"represent\" the Serbian population, some of whom are listed as political independents and other whom are members of political parties.37\n",
      "\n",
      "Current estimates indicate that approxiamately 200,000 Serbs fled from western Slavonia and Krajina during the Croatian Army offensives in mid-1995, and those Serbs currently remaining in government-controlled areas of Croatia are believed to comprise only 4 percent of Croatia's population. If a significant number of Serbs do not return to Croatia or if the Croatian government obstructs their repatriation,38 Serbs will no longer be guaranteed proportional respresentation in parliament. Current proportional respresentation of Serbs in Croatia'sparliament is based on 1991 census figures and guaranteed Serbian representation in parliament in the future remains uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the scope of attacks against Serbs decreased and efforts were made to increase minority representation in parliament between 1992 and 1994, gangs or individual extremists continue to single out Serbian civilians and their property for attack in Croatia apart from any military operation. According to the Croatian government, numerous buildings belonging to Serbs living in Croatia have been damaged or destroyed by explosives, arson or other deliberate means. A total of 7,489 such buildings were damaged or destroyed during 1992, and a total of 220 were destroyed from January to March 1993.39 The police regularly come to the scene of the crime and write a report. The police claim to investigate the crimes, but the perpetrators are rarely found. According to government sources, by late 1993, criminal proceedings had been initiated against 126 Croats, thirteen Serbs and eight persons belonging to other ethnic groups for the destruction of such property.40 Although Croatian government agents may not always be responsible for such attacks, prosecution of such crimes continues to be lax.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although some non-Croats report discrimination in the workplace, most Serbs in Croatia interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives in the past three years claimed that the denial of citizenship was their main problem. Serbs in the Rijeka area have taken their grievances to the Croatian government in Zagreb and report that they were favorably received and that steps were taken to address some of their concerns. As described in the following section, Serbs are also the main victims of arbitrary evictions by military authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the news on state-owned Croatian Television (Hrvatska Televizija - HTV) is often presented in ways which exacerbate rather than ameliorate inter-ethnic strife and discrimination (for example, by exaggerating abuses perpetrated against Croats by Serbian or Muslim forces, or by not reporting or understating abuses perpetrated by Croatian troops.)Publications containing jingoist and rascist materials are published by independent groups in Croatia. Although not directly supported by the government, state-controlled enterprises provide financial aid to these publications by advertising in them. For example, the state-controlled or -managed firms of Croatia Insurance, Tobacco Factory Zadar,Tanker Commerce Zadar, et. al., advertise in Hrvatski vjesnik, an independent, right-wing paper based in the town of Vinkovci in eastern Croatia.41\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Serbs, other minorities living in Croatia also have been attacked or discriminated against in Croatia, usually in regard to the granting of citizenship. Some have also been mistreated in detention. For example, according to Amnesty International, Dñemal Muratov_c was arrested in his home town of Slavonski Brod on February 7, 1994, and allegedly was severely beaten for two days during interrogation. On February 10, he was transferred to another police station in Djakovo and then to the police station in the town of Poñega (formerly Slavonska Poñega). On February 11, a police doctor visited Muratovi_ and reportedly confirmed injuries consistent with beating, including damage to the kidneys and a burst ear-drum. The doctor recommended a full medical inspection and immediate treatment. Muratovi_'s relatives and lawyer reportedly were not allowed to arrange for their own doctor to examine him.42\n",
      "\n",
      "Muratovi_, a Croatian citizen of Bosnian Muslim origin, is a truck driver who regularly drove humanitarian aid into Bosnia for a Muslim charity. Muratovi_ and a Croat neighbor who was towing his car after it broke down were arrested together, apparently on suspicion of car theft. The Croat neighbor was released after several hours. Muratovi_'s wife also was brought in for questioning on the first day of his detention and was released after several hours. She and a lawyer subsequently had access to Muratovi_.43\n",

      "A NOTE ON THE 1995 DECREE ON THE TEMPORARY EXPROPRIATION AND CONTROL OVER CERTAIN PROPERTY\n",
      "\n",
      "As this report went to print in late August, the Croatian government issued a decree on the Temporary Expropriation and Control Over Certain Property which effectively placed most Serbian-owned property and possessions in Croatia under Croatian government control. The decree, which went into effect on September 4,1995, places under Croatian government control a) all property \"abandoned\" by displaced persons from the Krajina and western Slavonia areas, b) property owned but \"abandoned\" by individuals who left Croatia since August 17, 1990 (the day the Serbian rebellion in Croatia began), c) property owned by individuals residing in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) and the Serbian-controlled areas of eastern Slavonia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, and d) property owned by citizens of the FRY. Only Serbs who remained in Croatian government-controlled areas throughout the entire war and who hold title to their property are not affected by the decree. Although the decree states that the expropriation of the Serbs' property is \"temporary,\" it does not specify the duration of the government's control over the property.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a decree revokes a persons' right to ownership without due process. It punishes all Serbs who remained in \"enemy\" territory during the war, although they may not have committed any domestic or internationally-recognized crime. Insofar as a person is guilty of a crime, he or she should be held accountable for his or her actions. Collective punishment of a group because of their ethnicity or residency during war is discriminatory. Since the Croatian government re-asserted control over the Krajina area in early August 1995, Croats displaced or expelled from Serb-held territory in Bosnia and Croatia and from the FRY are being resettled in homes belonging to Serbs in the Krajina area. Coupled with the destruction of Serbian property and the resettling of Krajina since early August 1995, the new decree collectively punishes Serbs from Krajina and seriously hampers their ability to return to their homes, should they chose to do so in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. EVICTIONS FROM STATE-OWNED HOUSING\n",
      "\n",
      "During communist rule in the former SFRJ, those who were members of the officer corps or worked for the Yugoslav Army (JNA) or any military-owned or operated enterprise (such as military hospitals) were allotted apartments and houses by the Yugoslav Army. Because a majority of the Yugoslav Army's officer corps was Serbian and many of those employed by it in Croatia were non-Croats, the residents of Yugoslav Army-owned apartments in Croatia were primarily non-Croats.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past few years, persons residing in apartments formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army have been evicted by members of the Croatian Army, the military police or by unidentified persons in uniform, without recourse to due process. Despite pleas from local human rights and civil liberties groups in Croatia, the government has not taken vigorous steps to provide legal protections to those being evicted nor has the government taken steps to stop and prevent abuse during such evictions. When public pressure against such evictions increases, the military police often refrain temporarily from further evictions. But such evictions resume after protests cease or diminish in frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki does not take a position on who is entitled to housing owned and operated by the state. We are, however, concerned that state agents are violating the right to due process in such property disputes and are using violence during many evictions. Military authorities should not discriminate by granting or withdrawing housing rights on the basis of ethnicity and/or presumed political views. Nor should military authorities abuse their power by forcefully evicting their perceived \"enemies\" for the benefit of their perceived friends and allies. The military authorities have also eroded the rule of law in Croatia by refusing to comply with judicial orders restoring housing rights to evicted occupants.\n",

      "RELEVANT LEGISLATION\n",
      "\n",
      "The October 1991 Decree\n",
      "\n",
      "In October 1991, the Croatian government issued a decree transferring the ownership of property belonging to the Yugoslav Army or the Yugoslav Defense Ministry (Savezni Sekretarijat za Narodnu O(d)branu - SSNO) to the Croatiangovernment. The Croatian Defense Ministry was given the responsibility of managing and administering such property.44\n",
      "\n",
      "The Law Concerning the Temporary Use of Apartments\n",
      "\n",
      "The fiercest fighting between Croatian troops and Serbian and Yugoslav Army forces occurred during the latter part of 1991, resulting in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people. Faced with an influx of displaced persons and little housing, the Croatian parliament passed a law allowing for the \"temporary use of apartments owned by public enterprises or persons or the Republic of Croatia, that is, [those apartments] over which the Republic of Croatia has the right to use and administer, and which are otherwise empty, vacated or abandoned.\"45 The Law Concerning the Temporary Use of Apartments stipulates that the apartments in question are to be used for the housing of displaced persons, refugees and members of the Croatian armed forces and their families.46 Article 2 allows for the temporary use of the following apartments:\n",
      "\n",
      "· empty apartments for which no one has obtained tenant rights (stanarsko pravo);\n",
      "\n",
      "· vacated apartments for which tenant rights exist and for which it can be determined that the residents of the apartment and members of their household have vacated the premises and removed their belongings; and\n",
      "\n",
      "· abandoned apartments for which tenant rights exist and for which it can be determined that the residents of the apartment and members of their household have permanently abandoned [their apartments].\n",
      "\n",
      "The law, therefore, allows the government to utilize apartments formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army or Defense Ministry - commonly referred to as \"military apartments\" (\"vojni stanovi\" - to house displaced persons and refugees, provided that these apartments are empty or have been vacated. The law does not allow for the use of apartments occupied by persons who have legal ownership of, or hold tenant rights to, the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Law Concerning the Temporary Use of Apartments establishes a commission charged with the administration of the apartments in question. The members of this commission include one representative from the Croatian government's Office for Displaced Persons or the Center for Social Welfare. The Croatian Army, the police and the Fund for Housing (fond za stambene gospodarstva) each have one representative on the commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former Yugoslav Army-owned apartments which became the property of the Croatian government and over which the Croatian Defense Ministry has control are administered by a commission appointed by the ministry. Similarly, apartments belonging to the Ministry of Interior are administered by a commission appointed by that body. Remaining apartments that are not the property of the Ministries of Defense or Interior are administered by a commission appointed by the Croatian government, on the basis of recommendations offered by the Ministry of Justice and Public Administration. Each of the commissions are to decide how and for whom an apartment is to be allotted on a temporary basis. However, the vast majority of the apartments from which persons are being evicted are administered de facto exclusively by the Croatian Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 9 of the law states that the temporary use of an apartment cannot exceed one year and that, should a displaced person or refugee be able to return to his or her home, the occupier would be required to vacate the apartment. Article 12 makes it a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine, for a person to enter an apartment without a permit from the relevant commission allowing for the temporary use of the apartment. Article 13 of the law requires that the Croatian government establish a commission to monitor and regularly inform the government about the enforcement of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to stress that, according to Croatia's Law Regarding the Temporary Use of Apartments, before an apartment can be allotted to a displaced or other person, the apartment must be empty. The law does not allow for the eviction of persons still living in Yugoslav Army-owned apartments. Indeed, Croatian law expressly states that due process must be afforded to those who face eviction.48\n",
      "\n",
      "Controversy Regarding the Use of Military Apartments After July 24, 1991\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, tenants of apartments formerly owned by the communist state or socialist enterprises have been allowed to buy their apartments and obtain legal ownership, an opportunity which many have taken. However, the tenants of apartments owned by the Croatian government - including apartments formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army or Defense Ministry - generally have not been permitted to purchase, and thereby obtain legal ownership of, their apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some parts of the Croatian government and legal community - including the Ministry of Defense and local military housing commissions which allot the military apartments to displaced persons and refugees - dispute the right of tenants to reside in military apartments if their tenant rights were issued by the Yugoslav Army after July 1991. They base this on two Croatian government decrees. A July 1991 decree forbade the disposal of real property on the territory of the Republic of Croatia.49 As described above, the October 1991 decree transferred ownership of property formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army and Defense Ministry to the Croatian government. Both decrees effectively forbid the sale, exchange, donation, transfer of the right to use or administer, leasing and temporary use, mortgage and similar transactions of real estate in Croatia that was previously owned by the former SFRJ.50 The decrees are seen by some as effectively annulling the rights of tenants if their apartments were allotted by the Yugoslav Army after July 24, 1991; in other words, after July 24, 1991, the transfer of Yugoslav Army-owned property and any action taken by the Yugoslav Army in Croatia is no longer considered valid. Citing these decrees, proponents of this argument claim that the Croatian government has a legal right to evict persons frommilitary apartments if their tenant rights to the apartment in question were issued after July 24, 1991.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of the aforementioned position point to internationally-brokered agreements signed by the Croatian government to support their claim that the evictions of persons who received rights to occupy military apartments after July 24, 1991, is illegal. Two agreements negotiated by the European Union (formerly the European Community - EC) are cited to support this position, i.e., the so-called Brioni Declaration signed by Croatia and Slovenia on July 7, 1991, and a November 1991 agreement signed by the Yugoslav Army and the Croatian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brioni Declaration was signed by Slovenia and Croatia eleven days after both republics declared their independence from the former SFRJ. According to the terms of that agreement, Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend, for a period of three months, all declarations and acts passed by the Croatian and Slovenian parliaments that were related to those states' secession from the SFRJ. The Brioni Agreement would allow for the suspension - until October 7, 1991 - of Croatia's July 24, 1991, decree forbidding the transfer and administration of property formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army or Defense Ministry. The suspension of such laws and decrees would ensure that those who obtained tenant rights to military apartments between July 24 and October 7, 1991, could not be evicted by the Croatian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents of this argument also assert that, according to Article 4 of the November 22, 1991, agreement between the Yugoslav Army and the Croatian government, the latter agreed \"to guarantee the safety and inviolability of private property and the right to the unhampered use of apartments\" (emphasis added) by members of the JNA who chose not to leave Croatia. The agreement also states that the decision of former Yugoslav Army personnel to remain in Croatia resulted in the termination of their service in the Yugoslav Army and guaranteed them the same civil liberties afforded all other citizens of the Republic of Croatia. In this case, the Croatian government's signature to this agreement forbids the eviction of persons living in military apartments and exempts the application of the July 1991 decree forbidding the transfer of property formerly owned by the SFRJ to tenants of military apartments.\n",
      "\n",
      "To date, the applicability of the July 1991 decree remains controversial; while some members of the Croatian government cite the decree to justify evictions, others argue that such evictions are illegal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Legislation Related to Housing\n",
      "\n",
      "Irrespective of whether or not a person retains tenant rights to his or her apartment, Croatia's Law on Housing Relations allows for the revocation of those rights under certain circumstances.51 For example, Article 99 of the law states that persons may lose the tenant rights to their apartments if they have not lived in the apartment for over six months. However, it is important to note that, according to Article 105 of the Law on Housing Relations, only a court of law can revoke a person's tenant rights; an administrative or government agency - such as the local military housing commissions responsible for the eviction of persons from military apartments - does not have that authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ministry of Defense often has tried to justify its evictions of persons from \"military apartments\" by citing amendments to the Law on Housing Relations, which allow for the eviction of persons from their apartments if that person is \"an enemy of the state.\" For example, amendments and revisions to the Law on Housing Relations issued on April 17, 1992, state that a person who has taken part in, or continues to take part in, acts of hostility against the Republic of Croatia, can lose the tenant rights to his or her apartment(s).52 However, such amendments continue to provide for due process and explicitly state that only a court of law can legally nullify an agreement regarding the use of such a housing unit(s).\n",

      "ABUSES OF THE LAW\n",
      "\n",
      "The Croatian Ministry of Defense and local military housing commissions have provided permits allowing soldiers and their families - many of whom are Croats who have been forcibly displaced from their homes in Croatia by rebel Serbian forces - to utilize military apartments despite the fact that the current residents of the apartment - the vast majority of whom are non-Croats and hadformerly been employed by the Yugoslav Army - continue to live in their homes and have not been afforded the opportunity to protest their eviction to an independent arbiter.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, the local military housing commissions revoke a tenant's rights to occupy a military apartment, despite the fact that only a court of law can rescind such rights. The revocation of a person's tenant rights by the local housing commissions is used to justify his or her eviction. A written notice is sent by the local military housing commission to the tenants in question, notifying them that their right to occupy their military apartment has been rescinded. The notice also specifies the day and time by which they must vacate the premises or be forcibly evicted, usually by Croatian Army soldiers. Threats, harassment, violence and destruction of property often are used by soldiers to force persons from their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The largest number of military apartments in Croatia are located in the cities of Zagreb, Split, Pula, Zadar, Rijeka and Karlovac.53 In the past three years, Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has received scores of complaints concerning forcible evictions in all of the aforementioned cities. The victims of such evictions are predominantly non-Croats, most often Serbs. Croats whose family members - usually non-Croats - had worked for the Yugoslav Army but had left Croatia also are being evicted from their homes. We have documented several cases involving the excessive use of force during evictions, were present at an illegal eviction and have spoken with government officials about these practices. Croatian human rights organizations, such as the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and the Center for Peace, Non-Violence and Human Rights, have worked tirelessly on this issue and have documented scores of additional cases.54 The following select cases illustrate the methods used by the Croatian Army and the military housing commissions to illegally evict persons from their homes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case #1:\n",
      "\n",
      "Evictions from state-owned housing are most frequent in Zagreb and Split. Between February and November 1993, 364 illegally evicted persons or families appealed to the courts in Split.55 The courts ruled on 280 cases, in which all but 60 of those evicted were reinstated in their homes. However, according to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, the military authorities in Split have refused to execute almost all of the court orders.56 The offices of two lawyers who defended the evicted tenants were damaged by explosives planted by allegedly unknown assailants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The attempted eviction of a mother and her daughter in Split resulted in the death of a bodyguard they had hired to protect them. V.P. and her mother - both Croats - are the daughter and wife of a former Yugoslav Army officer - a Serb - who left Croatia in late August 1991 when the Yugoslav Army was withdrawing from Croatia.57 After Mr. P. had left Croatia, the P. family was harassed58 and Croatian military personnel in uniform repeatedly threatened Mr. P.'s wife, daughter and son with eviction. Ms. P. and her daughter were frequently visited, interrogated and sometimes threatened by Croatian military personnel in uniform during the course of two years.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Ms. P. and her daughter, members of the fourth battalion of the Croatian Army had come to their apartment building on the 26th or 27th of July 1993, compiling a list of persons who lived in the apartment building. According to Ms. P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "All the apartments in the building are military apartments ... They [the soldiers compiling the list] wanted to know how manypeople lived in each apartment. They went only to the Serbs' homes and to the homes of those persons who had left [Croatia] with the JNA [but whose families remained in Split]. These soldiers were not people from Split. They were from Hercegovina.59\n",
      "\n",
      "According to V.P., Ms. P.'s daughter:\n",
      "\n",
      "Once they came by when only my brother - who is twenty years old - was at home. They didn't have a warrant to search the place. They searched the dresser, and they said my mother had to come to the police station.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. P. and V.P. went to the police station the following day but V.P. was not allowed to enter the room with her mother. According to Ms. P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "They told me I wasn't a good Croat; otherwise I would have sent my son into the Croatian Army. Two men questioned me. They were dressed in civilian clothing and they identified themselves only after I insisted. I demanded to see the chief of the station, and then they told me that I could leave. I was never bothered by them again.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, August 10, 1993, while V.P. and her mother were on vacation, Mladen _unji_, a member of the fourth battalion of the Croatian Army, came to their apartment, removed their name from the door and replaced it with a notice stating \"Do not enter - dangerous.\" Ms. P.'s neighbors called the police, but _unji_ had already left by the time the police arrived. V.P. and her mother returned from vacation on Saturday, August 14, but they went to the police before returning to their apartment. V.P. recounted their experience with the civilian and military police on that day:\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to the first police station and spoke with Mr. Jure Catipovi_, the deputy commander of the station. He called the military police. The civilian police escorted us to our apartmentbuilding in a police car, and we waited for the military police to arrive. It was about 9:00 in the morning. We went to the apartment with the military police, and we knocked on the door. _unji_ was alone in the apartment. He was stripped to the waist but had a gun strapped to his belt. He wouldn't let us into the apartment and told the military police officer that he wasn't going to do anything he told him to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. P. continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "The military police didn't want to argue with him so they took all of us, including _unji_, to the military police station at Lora,60 where we went to meet the commander of the military police. The civilian police officers then left. The commander wasn't there so we were taken to [see] the officer on duty. After we spoke to him, _unji_ went in to be questioned but he obviously knew everyone there - they were friends. He didn't stay inside longer than two minutes. Then they questioned us about things that had nothing to do with the apartment. They asked where we were from, about my husband. We eventually asked about the status of our apartment, and they asked me if it was a military apartment. I replied that it was. They told me that he [i.e., _unji_] had more right to be there than we.\n",
      "\n",
      "We left the room and asked to speak to the commander but they said he wasn't in, that it was a Saturday. We left, intending to go back to the civilian police, at which point we saw soldiers driving _unji_ somewhere - we presumed back to our apartment. We went to the civilian police and explained that the military police wouldn't do anything to help us. They were surprised but said that they could not do anything - that _unji_ was a soldier and they could only help us if he attacked us.\n",
      "\n",
      "V.P. and her mother went to her grandmother's and later in the afternoon returned to the military police headquarters at Lora. According to Ms. P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "We spoke to a higher-ranking officer, and he asked me for the document giving me the right to occupy my apartment, which was issued twenty years ago. He told me that it was no longer valid. Then he told me that they couldn't do anything until the military court interviewed us.\n",
      "\n",
      "At about 7:00 p.m., we went to the city court, which is a civilian court. We spoke with the judge on duty. She was good to us, but she told us that this was not within her jurisdiction and told us that we had to go to the military court. She referred us to a lawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. P. and her daughter returned to their apartment in the evening. The military police came twice to their apartment although neither Ms. P. nor her daughter had called them. According to Ms. P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "At about 9:00 p.m., we returned to our apartment, and we told the [civilian] police that we were there. They came five minutes later to write a report. While the two police officers were still there, two military police officers arrived. It was about 10:00 or 10:30 p.m.. We had not called the military police, so they left. After the civilian police officers left, three military police officers arrived, at about 10:45 p.m.. They had long-barrelled weapons, but I wouldn't let them into the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the interim, V.P. had called a private agency, called \"Bond,\" asking for a bodyguard. The bodyguard, Maksimilian Markovi_, arrived several minutes before the three military police officers. Markovi_ opened the door and invited the three military police officers to have a seat in the apartment. According to V.P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "We described to the military police officers what had happened with the apartment, who my father was, and the three military police officers were very polite. They left shortly thereafter. Markovi_ stayed, and he went to fix the lock on our door; we had to break it to get into the apartment because _unji_ had replaced our lock with his.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Ms. P., her daughter and the bodyguard were in the apartment, _unji_ broke in. According to V.P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "[Markovi_] had finished the lock at about 12:15 a.m.. Because they were rationing electricity61, he came into the living room with two candles ... and asked for some water, which [my mother] got from the kitchen. It was then that _unji_ came and kicked in the door. He had a huge gun, plus another gun in his holster. He came to us in the living room and started yelling what we were doing in his apartment! Markovi_ told him that there was no need to yell or to get upset. He told [_unji_] that he'd explain everything to him. He showed him all our documents. _unji_ then told Markovi_, \"What kind of Croat are you!?! I kill your kind with two fingers. The ,,etniks62 burned three of my houses!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "While he was arguing, my mother and I sneaked out of the apartment and ran across the street to some friends' home to call the police, but we heard shots coming out of the apartment. I ran into the apartment to see what had happened. _unji_ went toward the hallway, and we went after him and he asked me where his lock was. I told him I didn't know. He told Maks to get the phone and call the military police. Maks told _unji_ to call them himself at which point _unji_ shot off a round of bullets into the floor, about half a meter from us. He started yelling and told us to get out. I said OK, and I ran outside barefoot, and then I heard another burst of gunfire which lasted for about thirty or forty seconds. I ran across the street to call the Bond agency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second burst of gunfire killed Markovi_. V.P.'s mother had been waiting for the police to arrive outside the apartment building after her daughter ran back into the apartment when she heard the first gunshots. According to V.P.:\n",
      "\n",
      "Two civilian police officers arrived quickly. The military police came after they did. They disarmed _unji_, and the military police took him away. While they were doing this, they wanted to take us to Lora for questioning, but I refused and told them that I would come in the morning. They finished filing their report at 3:00 a.m., and the military police told us that no one could sleep in the apartment so, at 3:00 a.m., we walked for an hour and a half to my grandmothers's. We didn't want anyone to drive us.\n",
      "\n",
      "V.P. and her mother went to the military police on Monday, after consulting with a lawyer who instructed them to go to the military police. After they gave their statement to the military police, Ms. P. and her daughter went to the military court, where they also gave a statement to a Mr. B.,63 who promised to accompany them to their apartment the next day. Nevertheless, Ms. P. and her daughter had not returned to their apartment at the time of our interview.\n",
      "\n",
      "V.P. and her mother reported that _unji_ was in jail and that he had been charged with murder. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has not been able to confirm whether _unji_ was convicted and if, he had been found guilty, whether and where he was serving a sentence of imprisonment. According to Ms. P. and her daughter, _unji_ was originally from Mostar, Bosnia-Hercegovina, but belonged to the fourth battalion of the Croatian Army.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Croatian authorities properly arrested and charged _unji_, local military police officers appear to have been in complicity with _unji_ in his efforts to remove the P. family forcibly from their home. Indeed, this is a pattern found throughout Croatia - local military commanders encourage or condone forcible evictions by soldiers, and often such evictions are characterized by a lack of due process, discrimination, violence and, in this case, murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The murdered bodyguard, Maksimilian Markovi_ was twenty-one years old, married to an eighteen-year-old woman and the father of an eighteen-month-old son. He was a Croat by nationality and had served throughout Dalmatia as a member of the 72nd and 73rd Split brigade of the military police of the Croatian Army. After his death, Markovi_'s father, mother and brother wrote an open letterto members of the fourth Split brigade of the Croatian Army, to which Mladen _unji_ - Markovi_'s murderer - had belonged. The letter was published in the Split-based daily Slobodna Dalmacija.64 In the letter, Markovi_'s family demanded to know from the fourth battalion why it had not taken steps to prevent the \"terrorization\" of Ms. P. and her daughter. The family condemned the fact that officials of the Croatian Army - including then Croatian Army Chief of Staff General Janko Bobetko - and members of the fourth battalion did not publicly condemn the murder of their son and brother. The family ended their letter by asking the Croatian Army to take measures to ensure that similar tragedies be prevented in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case #2:\n",
      "\n",
      "Arbitrary violence is frequently used by Croatian Army soldiers or the military police in many illegal evictions. In some cases, human rights activists working to prevent evictions have been the target of such attacks. On February 2, 1994, the president of the Split-based Dalmatian Committee for Human Rights was severely beaten by uniformed men while trying to prevent an illegal eviction. The attack occurred in the presence of the military and civilian police, which reportedly did not intervene to stop the attack.65\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of the Dalmatian Committee for Human Rights report that they were physically attacked twice in Split by the same Croatian Army soldier in mid-and late February 1994. The soldier reportedly had moved into an apartment illegally. According to the Dalmatian Committee for Human Rights, on February 26, Mr. Rogo_i_, a member of the Committee, was severely beaten and kicked by the aforementioned soldier in a cafe. Rogo_i_ fainted as a result of the beating, and the attacker eventually was stopped by persons accompanying him.66 To the best of our knowledge, charges were never brought against the soldier who beat Mr. Rogo_i_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case #3:\n",
      "\n",
      "Some evictions have also been accompanied by the use of force against members of the media, thereby obstructing freedom of the press. For example, foreign journalists covering the eviction of a family in Zagreb on December 3, 1993, were prevented by Croatian Army soldiers and members of the military police from approaching the apartment complex in which the family lived. The soldiers attacked a journalist for the Associated Press, \"tugging her by the hair and throwing her to the ground.\" A video cassette was confiscated from a television crew, and a camera operator was struck in the face. Apparently in response to protests from the international community, the Croatian Defense Ministry later ceased its efforts to evict the residents of the apartment in question.67\n",
      "\n",
      "Case #4:\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1993, a Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representative and domestic human rights activists arrived at the home of a couple who were being evicted by Croatian Army soldiers in the Dugave section of Zagreb. Ms. I.D., who retained the rights to occupy the apartment, and her husband had worked at the Yugoslav Army's military hospital in Zagreb and were allotted their apartment as its employees. After the Yugoslav Army left Croatia, Mr. and Ms. D. decided to remain in Zagreb and continued to work at the hospital, which has been renamed \"New Hospital\" (Nova Bolnica). Mr. and Ms. D. received three notices that they were to be evicted by the local military housing commission. Anticipating violence and threats, Mr. and Ms. D. sent their two children to live with relatives in another part of Zagreb.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 10, 1993, approximately ten Croatian Army soldiers armed with handguns came to the apartment. Ms. D. asserted that the soldiers arrived in two trucks and with a written order for their eviction. Ms. D. claims that the soldiers verbally threatened her and her husband, demanding that they leave the apartment. According to Ms. D., two civilian police officers arrived at the same time as the Croatian Army soldiers, and the police officers ordered the soldiers to remain outside, claiming that the military did not have jurisdiction to deal with civilians. The soldiers complied and, at the time of our arrival, were standing outside the building and allowed us to enter the apartment. The two police officers remained in the apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Local human rights advocates were in the apartment with Mr. and Ms. D.. These activists had contacted the office of Stipe Mesi_, then the president of the Croatian parliament and an opponent of such evictions, asking him to intercede on behalf of Mr. and Ms. D.. Mesi_ and Ante Djapi_, a member of the parliament's human rights committee, sent a fax to officials at the Ministry of Defense demanding that they halt the eviction. Two unarmed representatives of the local military housing commission - dressed in civilian clothing - then arrived at the apartment to reiterate that Mr. and Ms. D. must leave the apartment. After about two hours of telephone and fax communication between Mesi_ and the Defense Ministry, an order was sent to stop the eviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "A military police officer named Mario Markovi_ then arrived and asked to enter the home. He politely interviewed the couple, specifically asking if the soldiers had mistreated them in any way. They responded that they were threatened with force by the soldiers if they did not move out. Mr. Markovi_ recorded their statements and asked for the names of the soldiers standing outside. Some of the soldiers had already left, but others gave their names to Markovi_. Markovi_, the two representatives from the housing commission and the police officers then wrote up their reports, exchanged papers and left.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this instance, the eviction of Mr. and Ms. D. was prevented because high-ranking government officials had interceded at the request of local human rights groups, specifically the Center for Peace, Non-Violence and Human Rights and the Human Rights Commission of the Social-Democratic Union (Socijaldemokratska Unija - SDU).68 The behavior of the two civilian officers and Mario Markovi_, the military police officer, was commendable. However, the Croatian Army soldiers and the representatives of the local military housing commission were rude and insulting and, at first, had dismissed the authority of high-ranking government officials to dispute decrees of the military authorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Mr. and Ms. D. were not evicted at that time, Ms. D. was sure that they would be evicted at a later date. Indeed, in November 1993, Mr. and Ms. D. were evicted from their home. Mr. and Ms. D. have appealed to the courts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case #5:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the U.N. Special Rapporteur, proceedings had been initiated against \"enemies of the state\" in 3,120 instances by November 1993, under amendments and revisions to the Law on Apartment Relations, which allows forthe termination of tenant rights to such persons, pending a court hearing.69 In many instances, as in the following case documented by local human rights groups in Osijek, non-Croats are summarily evicted from their homes under the pretext that they, or members of their family, are \"enemies of the state.\" They are not afforded the right to due process, although Croatian law guarantees them that right.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to an ordinance issued by the local military housing commission in Osijek, M.V. was required to leave his apartment and temporarily move into a smaller apartment \"which would accommodate the number of persons in his family.\" The ordinance stated that spacious military apartments were being confiscated from families whose members had joined rebel Serbian forces and who had left behind other family members to care for their property. The ordinance stated that, until a decree specifying the status of such family members was established, the apartment in question was to be used to house refugees and displaced persons; family members currently occupying the apartment would be moved to a smaller military or publicly-owned apartment. Should the refugees or displaced persons return to their homes and vacate the apartment in question, the ability of the original occupants to return to the apartment would again be considered.70\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact or suspicion that a member of a family is fighting with rebel Serbian forces does not allow for the persecution of family members who have not participated in such hostilities and or broken any laws. The eviction of such persons from their home places guilt on persons by virtue of their association with a member of their family. Insofar as a person is guilty of a crime, the individual in question - and not his or her family members - should be held accountable before a court of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, the ordinance in question was applied to evict M.V. and his family without legal basis. In fact, the ordinance explicitly states that a law regulating the status of families whose members had joined rebel Serbian forces, but whose other members remained in Croatian government-controlled areas, had not yet been issued. In the absence of a court ruling, a local military housing commission does not have the right to evict a family summarily.\n",

      "Case #6:\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, persons who have been illegally evicted from their homes seek redress in court and obtain a ruling in their favor, ordering the return of the evicted tenants to their apartments. However, some local military housing commissions and military police officers refuse to respect the ruling of the courts. In his report, the U.N. Special Rapporteur stated that his field staff\n",
      "\n",
      "had received an official notice dated July 20, 1993, in which the registrar of the Municipal Court of Rijeka testifies that 'the execution of the court order [to reinstate the unlawfully evicted tenant] was not acted upon because the military police did not obey the writ given by the court' on the grounds that they 'have different orders from their superiors.'71\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki has documented a similar case in Osijek. During the shelling of Osijek in 1991, B.B. and his wife, L. - both Croats - left Osijek to stay with relatives in Germany. In early February 1992, during the family's absence from Osijek, M.S, a Croatian Army soldier broke into the B.'s apartment, changed the lock on their door and moved in with his family. M.S. and his family had been forcibly displaced from their home in the village of Laslovo by rebel Serbian forces in 1991 or early 1992 and were living in Osijek as displaced persons.72\n",
      "\n",
      "When B.B. and his wife returned to Osijek, they asked M.S. to move out of their apartment but he refused. B.B. then filed a claim with the local Secretariat for Housing and Urban Affairs demanding that M.S. move out of their apartment within twenty-five days, as specified by Article 94 of the Law on Housing Relations. In the interim, M.S. sought and obtained from the military housing commission a permit to use the B.'s apartment for a period of one year. The Ministry of Justice and Public Administration declared invalid M.S.'s permit, butthe local military housing commission refused to revoke the permit and M.S. remained in the B.'s apartment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 1992, B.B. and his wife appealed their case to Croatia's constitutional court, which agreed with the Ministry of Justice and ruled that the issuance of the local military housing commission's permit had been illegal. Despite the ruling of Croatia's highest court, the military housing commission still refused to revoke M.S.'s permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Helsinki spoke with M.S. in July 1993, at which point he continued to occupy the B.'s apartment. M.S. was politically active in Osijek at the time of our visit, lobbying for the rights of displaced persons to housing. M.S. insisted that he had a right to the B.'s apartment by virtue of his affiliation with the Croatian Army and claimed that he had been assured, presumably by the authorities, that he would not be removed from the apartment. M.S.'s main concern focused on returning to his home in Laslovo.\n",

      "Branimir Glava_, the governor (ñupan) of the Baranja, eastern Slavonia and Srijem regions, and Petar Kljaji_, the head of Osijek's military housing commission and president of the Osijek district (okruñni) court, support - and Kljaji_ is directly responsible for - the evictions of persons from \"military apartments\" in Osijek. Both men reject the claim that such evictions are illegal. When Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives inquired about M.S.'s right to remain in the B.'s apartment, both Glava_ and Kljaji_73 defended M.S.'s right to remain in the apartment. Kljaji_ insisted that, as head of the housing commission that had allowed M.S. to make use of the B.'s apartment, he would do nothing to remove M.S. and his family from the apartment in question. Glava_ implied that the B.'s had been \"cowards\" when they left Osijek and that those who remained in Osijek - particularly those who fought to defend the city, as had M.S. - had priority to housing. Although Glava_ claimed that B.B. and his family could eventually return to their apartment, he said that they would have to wait until M.S. was ready to leave. According to Glava_:\n",

      "I don't care what you human rights types think. I have soldiers who were kicked out of their houses by the Serb[ian forces], who fought bravely and defended the city while it was being attacked. They and their families had no place to live so we put them in the apartments and houses of those who left Osijek during its most difficult days. Now these cowards who left the city are coming back, and they want their houses and apartmentsback. I don't care who these people [who are returning] happen to be - I don't care if they're Serbs, Hungarians, Croats or whatever. I'm not going to kick out the soldiers who stayed here to fight to accommodate those who left Osijek and spent their time drinking in European cafes during the war and who now want to come back. They'll have to wait until we can find the soldiers and the displaced persons a decent place to live.\n",
      "\n",
      "Glava_'s response is not unique; it is typical of residents who remained and continue to live in areas most affected by the war, particularly in the municipalities of Osijek, Karlovac, Pakrac, Slavonski Brod, Gospi_, Ogulin, Zadar, _ibenik and Dubrovnik. The need to care for displaced persons and refugees and the need to provide housing for soldiers and their families who otherwise do not have a home is a necessary task and hardship for the Croatian authorities, particularly the local authorities in the aforementioned areas. However, the eviction without basis in law of those formerly associated with the Yugoslav Army, those who fled their homes temporarily during the war and others is not a justifiable means through which authorities can provide housing for refugees and displaced persons.\n",

      "The Osijek, Zagreb and Rijeka chapters of Croatia's Center for Peace, Non-Violence and Human Rights, representatives of the human rights committee of the Social-Democratic Union (SDU), the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights and local human rights advocates in Split have worked arduously for over three years in an effort to prevent arbitrary evictions in their respective municipalities and throughout the country. In numerous letters to the Croatian president and parliamentary president, Croatia's Roman Catholic archbishop, Franjo Kuhari_, also has protested against evictions of families from state-owned housing. Moderate, liberal, and even some conservative members of the Croatian government and ruling party have protested the role of the military police in forcing the eviction of tenants from housing formerly owned by the Yugoslav Army or the Yugoslav Defense Ministry.\n",

      "On February 12, 1993, Stjepan Herceg, then Croatia's State Prosecutor, sent a letter to Mate Lau_i_, the chief of the military police, protesting the abusive behavior of, and forcible evictions by, members of the military police. The letter states that only the courts can decide whether or not a person has the right tooccupy an apartment or dwelling and that the military police do not have the legal or other authority to evict persons forcibly from their homes. The letter asks Lau_i_ to ensure that the military police respect law and order.74\n",
      "\n",
      "While some members of the Croatian government have been sympathetic and have intervened to prevent such evictions, often their successes are only temporary. Sooner or later, members of the Croatian Army or the military police arrive and evict the apartment's tenants. The Ministry of Defense and local military housing commissions have turned a deaf ear to the efforts of human rights groups and even some high-ranking members of the Croatian government.\n",
      "\n",
      "In July 1994, the presence of human rights activists and foreign journalists prevented the Croatian police and soldiers from serving eviction notices on two families, who are Croatian by nationality.75 Indeed, due to the work of local human rights groups in Croatia, many evictions have been postponed. However, some human rights workers who have peacefully protested such evictions and have remained on the premises while evictions were in progress have been arrested and interrogated, and some have been beaten. On September 27, 1994, members of local non-governmental organizations76 and other persons were severely beaten by the police during an eviction.77\n",
      "\n",
      "Tensions are high between the various groups involved. In some cases, displaced persons have illegally broken into apartments which residents had temporarily evacuated to wait out the war in Croatia. In other instances, local housing commissions are granting permits to those displaced persons who broke into the apartments, legalizing their illegal entrance after the fact. In still other instances, displaced persons who had illegally broken into an apartment are evictedand sent to collective centers for displaced persons and refugees, where accommodations are not as comfortable as in a private apartment.78 Further cases involve evictions of refugees and displaced persons who have fled rebel Serbian-occupied areas and received apartments via friends or in apartment-swaps. These persons are evicted despite the fact that the law on Displaced Persons and Refugees79 forbids their eviction unless alternate housing can be provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the tensions, many displaced persons and refugees with whom we spoke did not approve of the evictions of former JNA personnel or of other refugees and displaced persons and did not feel secure in the temporary apartments in which they lived. According to a man who had been displaced from his home in eastern Slavonia and was currently living in an apartment from which the tenant had been forcibly evicted in Osijek:80\n",
      "\n",
      "We have problems with housing in this city. There are many displaced persons who were kicked out of their homes in 1991 and 1992 by Serbian forces and others continue to be expelled from their homes in [Serbian-controlled areas of] Baranja and eastern Slavonia. Just fifteen days ago, another ten people were expelled from Baranja - they're in ,,epin now. We need housing. If we don't have housing they start kicking people out of their homes. Those of us who live in these apartments [from which people have been evicted] don't feel any safer. We don't want to leave the apartment because you never know who'll move in while we've gone to buy milk or run an errand.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the end of 1993, the Croatian authorities had assumed control of approximately 2,000 apartments that formerly belonged to the Yugoslav Army, effectively rendering homeless many of the apartments' former occupants.81 In June 1994, President Tudjman told veterans of the war in Croatia that they were entitled to housing, suggesting this could be provided at the expense of those living in so-called \"military apartments,\" most of whom are non-Croats. According to press reports, President Tudjman was quoted as saying: \"Let us prove we are a civilized people, that we will grant all ethnic and minority rights to Serbs who accept Croatia as their homeland. [But] why are there 6,000 apartments with Serbs inside and you, Croatian invalids [i.e., veterans handicapped as a result of the war], haven't got any?\"82\n",

      "a moratorium had been adopted as of December 10 whereby all evictions would cease for a 20-day period, during which time all individual cases, as well as [relevant] legislation.., would be examined. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the Ministry of Defense was prepared to undertake concrete measures to compensate those who had been affected by the illegal evictions. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur was informed that a Commission of Control has been established in order to regulate the activities of the Housing Commission established pursuant to the Law on the Provisional Use of Apartments of 4 December 1994.83\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the December 1993 moratorium, reports of evictions decreased. Toward the end of 1993, some local authorities, such as those of the city council of Pula, decided to stop all evictions until the Administrative Court of Croatia ruled on the lawfulness of each individual case.84\n",

      "The U.N. Special Rapporteur reported that between March and mid-1994 his staff had not received reports of evictions carried out by Croatian Army soldierson active duty.85 By late 1994, the Special Rapporteur's staff was primarily investigating evictions involving soldiers on active duty which took place prior to March 1994. However, the staff pointed out that although evictions in 1994 decreased, those soldiers responsible for forced or illegal evictions in the past have not been disciplined nor criminally prosecuted for their abuses. Despite Croatian government promises to do so, no financial compensation has been provided to victims of illegal and forced evictions.86 Moreover, as illustrated in the preceding cases, forcible evictions continue in 1995.\n",

      "In mid-1994, the Croatian government accepted a draft proposal for a law regulating evictions from state-owned housing, but parliament postponed indefinately a vote on the proposal. According to the proposal, the occupants of state-owned apartments that were allotted to them before October 1991 would have the right to buy the apartment. According to the Special Rapporteur, the law does not appear to provide guarantees for the legal tenants.87 The Croatian government also promised to create a Commission of Control that would regulate the activities of the military housing commission but the Special Rapporteur had not been informed of the commission's work as of November 1994.88\n",

      "\n",
      "THE SITUATION OF REFUGEES IN CROATIA\n",
      "\n",
      "Attacks against and harassment of Muslim refugees escalated in 1993 but have since subsided. Most of the attacks against Muslim refugees were due to hostility felt against Muslims who fought Bosnian Croat forces in central Bosnia throughout 1993. In early 1994, a rapprochement between Bosnian Croats and Muslims, on the one hand, and the Republics of Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina on the other, decreased tensions between Muslims and Croats in general. In recent months, conciliatory press coverage and government statements have led to a decrease in attacks against Muslim refugees in Croatia. However, following the expulsion of Bosnian Croats and Muslims from their homes in the Bosnian Serb-held city of Banja Luka in August 1995, the Croatian government has reportedly been allowing Croats to enter Croatia but has only accepted a small number of Muslims, most of whom remain on the Croatian-Bosnian border. Also in August 1995, the Croatian government was obstructing deliverance of humanitarian aid to rebel Muslims loyal to Fikret Abdi_, a renegade leader aligned with the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs against Bosnian-government forces in the Biha_ area.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fighting between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia in 1993 resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of persons. Many displaced Bosnian Croats came to Croatia as refugees, and some of these refugees attacked Bosnian Muslim refugees currently living in Croatia. The Croatian government did little to protect Bosnian Muslim refugees from attack. Moreover, the anti-Muslim propaganda regularly heard on the state-controlled television and radio throughout 1993 exacerbated tensions between Muslims and Croats in Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of March 1995, the Croatian government was providing refuge to 189,000 refugees from Bosnia and 196,000 persons who have been internally displaced as a result of the war in Croatia in 1991 and thereafter.92 Officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Croatia told Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives that they estimated that an additional 30,000unregistered refugees were living in Croatia in mid-1994. With the notable exception of the forced repatriation of draft-age Bosnian males, UNHCR officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Helsinki representatives claimed that the Croatian government's treatment and accommodation of refugees has generally been good. In addition to receiving Bosnian refugees, Croatia continues to accept, and provide aid to, Croats, Hungarians and a very small number of Serbs who have fled or are transported by the U.N. from rebel Serbian-controlled areas of Croatia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Refugees are required to register with the Social Welfare Center based in the district (op...ina) in which they currently reside. Refugees are granted refugee status usually for three months, at which point they must renew their status. According to Maja Kurent, the Liaison Officer for UNHCR at the Croatian government's Office of Displaced Persons and Refugees (ODPR),93 if a refugee cannot return to his or her home in Bosnia because of continued fighting or fear of persecution, the refugee's status will be renewed. Once the war in Bosnia ends, refugees will be required to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "On July 13, 1992, Croatia stated that it could no longer bear the cost of accepting more refugees. However, it said children, the disabled, pregnant women and those with serious medical problems were to be permitted to enter Croatia and were allowed to register as refugees. The admission of other Bosnian Muslim refugees was to be limited to those with assured passage to a third country.94\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, however, the Croatian government has continued to accept refugees from Bosnia. These refugees are not issued refugee status but are given transit visas, in theory to transit Croatia en route to a third country. However, because the transit visa is valid only for forty-eight hours and foreign governments refuse or delay acceptance of Bosnian refugees, most of the displaced remain in Croatia. Croatia has agreed to accept these additional refugees temporarily, provided that the UNHCR take responsibility for their care and ensure that they are eventually resettled in a third country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many refugees have entered Croatia illegally. In February and March 1993, the Croatian government announced that it would grant refugee status to those Bosnians who had not registered as refugees in Croatia. Although many took the opportunity to legalize their stay in the country, many men chose not to registerwith the local authorities because they feared that they would be forcibly repatriated to Bosnia as draft evaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the summers of 1993 and 1994, the Croatian government issued orders that displaced persons and refugees residing in resort hotels along the Dalmatian coast and in Istria be transferred to other accommodations in order to make the hotels available for tourism and to refurbish resort areas. UNHCR confirmed that the Croatian government could rightfully remove the refugees and displaced persons from the hotels, but it asked the government to help provide alternate accommodations. The Croatian government then transferred many of the refugees to collective refugee centers in the village of Ga_inci (near Djakovo), to the island of Obonjan (near _ibenik) and other refugee settlements.\n",
      "\n",
      "In June and July 1994, Muslim refugees refused to leave their refugee accommodations in Istria after the Croatian government ordered that most refugees and displaced persons living in the resort areas of Istria be moved to alternate accommodations. The Croatian government responded to the refugees' refusal to leave the area by refusing to supply them with food. Deprivation of food to the refugees as a way of forcing them to accept a change of accommodations is unnecessarily cruel and potentially harmful for their health and security. Governmental authorities also should not create obstacles that would impede relief efforts of the international relief agencies, such as UNHCR. Although the Croatian government may have a legitimate reason to pursue changes in accommodations, it should try to achieve its objective by means that are less dangerous for the life and health of the refugees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Croatian government does have an obligation not to discriminate between refugees on account of race, religion or country of origin,95 some Croatian refugees and displaced persons (i.e., Croats from both Croatia and Bosnia) have been accorded preferential treatment over Muslim refugees. As the conflict between Bosnian Croats and Muslims worsened in 1993, Muslim refugees in Croatia became targets for discrimination and harassment by some local authorities, individual extremists and recently displaced Bosnian Croats. In some cases in 1993, Bosnian Muslim - but not Bosnian Croat - refugees were moved from hotels along the Dalmatian coast, particularly in the Makarska area. According to foreign relief workers interviewed by Human RightsWatch/Helsinki,96 Bosnian Croat refugees also were told that they had to leave the hotels but those who did not leave were allowed to remain. Conversely, local authorities threatened to revoke the refugee status of Bosnian Muslims if they did not agree to leave the hotels. Those refugees transferred to Obonjan island were harassed and robbed by local criminals, and the authorities in _ibenik placed unnecessary restrictions on the refugees' ability to leave the island and travel to the mainland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since March 31, 1993, with few exceptions, the police have refused to register Bosnian refugees, especially men of draft age, although some were offered transit visas. Some Bosnian Croats, however, received refugee status. Such an approach discriminates on the basis of ethnicity. Unregistered refugees are not entitled to humanitarian assistance from Croatian government relief agencies and, if arrested, receive an order for deportation to Bosnia.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, municipal authorities have removed the refugee status of Bosnian Croats and Muslims by categorizing the areas from which they come as \"safe.\" Zenica has been designated as \"safe\" for Muslims to return and Stolac and Mostar have been designated as \"safe\" for Croats, and more recently for Muslims, to return. Human Rights Watch/Helsinki believes that although fighting is no longer taking place in some of these areas, inter-ethnic tensions are such that precautions should be taken by the local authorities and agencies belonging to the U.N. or the European Union to ensure the safety of those returning. In particular, Croat-controlled western Mostar and Stolac are still not safe for returning Muslims and, until the local authorities responsible for abuses are removed or correct their abusive behavior, Muslims should not be forced to return to these areas against their will.97\n",
      "\n",
      "FORCED REPATRIATION AND FORCED MOBILIZATION INTO THE BOSNIAN CROAT ARMED FORCES\n",
      "\n",
      "For a period of time in late 1992 and 1993, the Croatian government refused to grant Bosnian men between the ages of eighteen and sixty refugee status in Croatia, claiming it was complying with a \"friendship agreement,\" signed by the Croatian and Bosnian governments in 1992. The agreement notes that all menbetween the ages of eighteen and sixty have been mobilized for military or work duty in Bosnia, and thus that both the Bosnian and Croatian governments consider Bosnian men who had fled to Croatia as draft evaders, not refugees. As a result, the Croatian government frequently sent Bosnian men back to the battlefront in Bosnia. In 1992, repatriated refugees were left in Croatian-controlled areas of Hercegovina, where they were allowed or induced to join the Bosnian Croat militia, the Croatian Defense Council (Hrvatsko Vije_e Obrane - HVO), or permitted to travel to areas controlled primarily by Muslim and Bosnian government forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The repatriation of Bosnian males in 1992 and early 1993 conflicted with the stance then taken by the UNHCR, which considers all Bosnians living outside their country as refugees, irrespective of their age, ethnicity or sex. Because civilians are the targets in the war in Bosnia, the UNHCR argued that those returned to Bosnia would necessarily become vulnerable to abuses of humanitarian law and therefore should not be repatriated.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bosnian-Croat \"friendship agreement\" cannot overrule the obligation of non-refoulement,98 which is customary international law. The Croatian government, even if it considers the men draft evaders, nevertheless has an obligation to allow them a fair opportunity to claim asylum. The Croatian government cannot decide that all Bosnian men of a certain age are draft evaders and, therefore, force them to repatriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Croatian government repatriated Bosnian men sporadically throughout 1992 and early 1993. After UNHCR and the international community protested such activity, the repatriations stopped for a period and then resumed, only to be protested by the international community again. In some cases, protests from the UNHCR resulted in the return to Croatia of refugees who had been forcibly repatriated to Bosnia.\n",
      "\n",
      "As fighting between Bosnian Croats and Muslims escalated in late 1992 and in mid- and late 1993, the Croatian government began arresting and forcibly repatriating Bosnians - primarily Muslims, but also Croats and a small number of Serbs - on a wider scale. Unlike in 1992, however, those Muslims being repatriated to Bosnia were not allowed to travel freely or to join the armed forces of their choice. Rather, Croatian government authorities delivered the Bosnian Muslim men to Bosnian Croat officials, who then imprisoned them in abusive jails and detention camps throughout Hercegovina, intending to use them for prisoner exchanges. Others were transferred to the Muslim-controlled area of Mostar, whichhad been under siege by Croatian forces for months. Those Bosnian Croats who were repatriated were given HVO uniforms and sent to the front.\n",
      "\n",
      "The forced repatriation, mobilization or imprisonment of Bosnian male refugees escalated during the summer of 1993, particularly in late July. On July 29, 1993, the field staff of the U.N. Special Rapporteur received reports that Bosnian refugees in Zagreb, Samobor, Split, Pula, Varadñin and the island of Obonjan were being forcibly repatriated to Bosnia.99 U.N. officials initially were denied access to those arrested.100 According to the United States government:\n",

      "1. Human Rights Obligations of International Financial Institutions (IFIs)\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch believes it is important for UN experts to ground their work on IFIs in the human rights standards applicable to these institutions. With the exception of the European banks, IFIs often argue that they are bound only by their own internal standards, rather than international human rights standards. It is essential that UN human rights experts counter this.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an international organization, the World Bank derives human rights obligations from customary international law and general principles of law.[1] As a UN specialized agency, it has an obligation to respect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.[2] In addition to the World Bank bearing human rights obligations in its own legal capacity, each of its member countries has similar and additional specific human rights obligations that derive, for example, from treaties to which they are a party. As UN member states, they are also obliged under article 103 of the UN Charter to comply with the Charter over other international agreements in the event of a conflict between the two.[3] The International Bill of Rights, which refers to the combination of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), is recognized as the key source used to interpret the rights provisions in the UN Charter.[4] Moreover, both states[5] and IFIs[6] have obligations to provide effective remedies for human rights violations to which they contribute or for which they are responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to the arguments of some, certain international human rights standards do apply to IFIs. IFIs should not only refrain from directly violating those rights protected under international law, but also factor them into decision making and address them if they arise.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. IFIs Do Not Work to Prevent or Respond to Reprisals Against Critics\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch research has revealed that IFIs have done little to prevent or respond to reprisals against critics of projects that they finance. Our 2015 report At Your Own Risk: Reprisals against Critics of World Bank Group Projects, documents cases of individuals and communities in Cambodia, Ethiopia, India, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and elsewhere that have faced reprisals from governments and powerful companies for criticizing projects financed by the World Bank and the IFC. These reprisals take a variety of forms. We documented cases where project critics and concerned community members have been the target of threats, intimidation tactics, and baseless criminal charges, as well as situations where security forces have responded violently to peaceful protests, physically assaulting community members and arbitrarily arresting them. Some women have faced sexual harassment or gender-based threats, attacks, or insults when they speak out. In other cases, critics or their family members have been threatened with the loss of their jobs or livelihoods. In many countries, these reprisals often occur within a broader effort to demonize critics as unpatriotic or “anti-development.”[7]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the grave risks that people living in communities affected by World Bank and IFC-financed projects take to speak out about the problems that they see with such projects or the harm that they face, the World Bank and IFC have done little to secure a safe environment in which people can speak freely without risk of reprisals. Bank and IFC officials failed to respond meaningfully to these breaches, doing little to support or compensate victims or to deter future attacks, despite the Group’s stated commitment to the principles of participation and accountability. In some cases, the World Bank Group has failed even to take appropriate action when people have suffered reprisals specifically because they were involved in bringing human rights concerns to the attention of Group officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "In repressive environments, the World Bank Group has often closed its eyes to the risk of abuse rather than engage in difficult conversations with partner governments.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, the World Bank Group has occasionally responded swiftly and publicly to certain high-profile incidents of reprisals. Former World Bank Group President James Wolfensohn intervened at the highest level of government, and publicly reported on his interventions when an Inspection Panel complainant and opposition leader was arrested in Chad in 2001. A World Bank official also spoke publicly against the Cambodian government’s violent crackdown on protestors in 2002, highlighting how such actions run contrary to any commitment to participation and accountability.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Although even at the time they were sporadic, such efforts by the Bank to respond to reprisals appear to have been replaced by, at best, quiet conversations behind closed doors with questionable utility. At worst, the prevailing response seems in some cases to have been one of complete apathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The World Bank should consistently emphasize to member countries that criticism of World Bank Group-financed activities is welcomed and seen as an important part of improving the impacts of development efforts—and that reprisals against critics or people otherwise involved in such activities will be publicly and vigorously opposed. Please see attached our recommendations to the World Bank Group, which apply equally to other development finance institutions.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Cultivate Space for Public Dialogue\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, a growing number of governments have embarked upon broad and sometimes brutal campaigns to shut down the space for civil society activity, in some cases going so far as to criminalize independent human rights work. These abusive measures can prevent people from participating in decisions about development, from publicly opposing development initiatives that may harm their livelihoods or violate their rights, and from complaining about development initiatives that are ineffective, harmful, or have otherwise gone wrong. These broader trends toward repression have profound impacts for IFI-supported projects in countries like Ethiopia and Uzbekistan. Not only do many community members and activists face an increasing risk of reprisal for speaking out against IFI-financed projects that enjoy government support, independent groups who could otherwise help communities articulate their concerns and perspectives about development projects face similar challenges. IFIs have not taken meaningful steps toward creating an enabling environment for participation and accountability when it finances projects in countries that are closing or have effectively closed civil society space or routinely punish dissent.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "IFIs should consider whether there is an enabling environment for public participation and accountability in developing their country strategies and partnerships. They should seize all available opportunities to support governments to open space for engagement and to confront governments that are actively working to close that space down. IFIs should consistently raise concerns with governments, both privately and publicly, when authorities use repressive tactics or introduce problematic laws; ensure opportunities for effective participation at the project level; and put additional monitoring in place to be able to detect problems, particularly in countries with a history of crackdowns on protests. In fact, IFIs have a role to play in ensuring that law enforcement is properly trained to strictly observe international standards on the use of force and provide protection to peaceful protestors during assemblies. While this is primarily a duty for states, IFIs should, at a minimum, emphasize to governments that peaceful protests about projects they finance are legitimate and should be permitted to take place outside the institution’s building, and ask governments to ensure that any law enforcement officials policing such protests are appropriately trained, supervised, and held to account for use of force that does not comply with international standards.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. IFI Accountability Mechanisms\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to our report, several IFI accountability mechanisms have been in the process of developing guidelines to prevent, monitor, and respond to reprisals. For example, on March 30, 2016, the Inspection Panel published Guidelines to Reduce Retaliation Risks and Respond to Retaliation During the Panel Process.[13] We encourage other accountability mechanisms and the institutions themselves to build on this positive development. We urge them to use every avenue available to respond to reprisals directly so as to ensure that the security of complainants and others is restored and maintained, as is their ability to continue their work as human rights defenders. This should include publicly denouncing reprisals and intervening in specific cases to push governments or companies to halt or refrain from serious abuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accountability mechanisms should also work with the institutions to develop an early warning system to identify threats or other security issues, particularly for those who have filed or are considering filing a complaint or are otherwise critical of a project. They should systematically analyze the risk of reprisals and other security risks linked to every complaint received, proactively discuss those risks with complainants, and promptly implement protection measures. The CAO has acknowledged that “the ‘culture of intimidation and reprisals within a given context should form part of any pre-project assessment of the appropriateness for engagement.’”[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "5. IFIs Should Support Governments in Realizing their Obligations to Regulate Business\n",
      "\n",
      "IFIs should also assist governments in fulfilling their obligations to regulate the practices of companies to ensure that they do not violate human rights.[15] They are well positioned to help advance rights at the national level by using their influence over member states and corporate clients. For example, in 2012, the IFC put forth “Performance Standards on Environmental and Social Sustainability” that outline how its clients should manage social and environmental risks.[16] The requirements cover consultation, risk identification and management, and grievance mechanisms, as well as security, with provisions adapted from the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.[17]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite these positive developments, more needs to be done. For example, the IFC’s Performance Standards do not address the challenges presented in environments where freedom of expression, assembly, and association are not respected or where community members and others face significant risks for being critical of proposed or ongoing projects. Moreover, the recognition of governments’ human rights obligations is absent from IFI advice on company regulation. The IFC could support improved government regulation by including country-by-country analysis of governments’ realization of this obligation in its annual “Doing Business” report.\n",
      "\n",
      "All businesses should have adequate policies and procedures in place to identify, prevent, mitigate, and account for their impact on human rights. To meet its human rights responsibilities, a company should carefully assess potential human rights risks, including in its supply chain, monitor the impact of its activities on an ongoing basis, seek to prevent or mitigate harm, and adequately address any adverse human rights impacts it causes or contributes to. Moreover, companies should not issue threats or take actions that might deter affected communities from voicing their concerns about a project or penalize them for doing so.

      "Although it developed safeguards for forced and child labor when investing in a project benefiting Uzbekistan’s cotton industry, the World Bank and IFC refused to adopt safeguards to allow independent monitors unfettered access to project sites or to prohibit retaliation against monitors, forced laborers, or whistleblowers. Civil society organizations repeatedly told Bank staff that these were critical measures, but staff advised that their legal advisors had told them such covenants were not possible.[19]\n",

      "\"It's surprising that the Turkish government has chosen to honor a foreign leader responsible for massive human rights violations,\" said Georgette Gagnon, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"The Turkish authorities should affirm their commitment to human rights principles by calling on Bashir to end the atrocities in Darfur.\"\n",

Many of them are soldiers of the former Rwandan government responsible for the 1994 genocide of Tutsi in Rwanda. The previously close collaboration recently fell apart in some units, however: the report describes how one hundred Rwandans were slaughtered by their comrades in the FNL (Forces Nationales de Libération).\n",

      "\"If a peace is cobbled together without justice for Burundi, this will be felt throughout the region,\" said Takirambudde. \"Given the bitterness of ethnic tensions in Central Africa, the failure to insist on accountability for crimes in Burundi will encourage ruthless leaders to choose ethnic slaughter as a way to defeat their enemies.

      "\n",
      "(Istanbul) – An Ankara court has ordered the detention of 17 current and former politicians and officials from the opposition Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP)and imposed judicial control conditions on three others released from custody, Human Rights Watch said today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court ordered the detentions in the scope of an ongoing investigation into the political party’s alleged involvement in violent protests in 2014.The Turkish government’s willingness to use incarceration to restrict the right to political association and crack down on an opposition party is another worrying sign of the erosion of rights and the rule of law in Turkey.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Detaining politicians from a party that won nearly 12 percent of the vote in the 2018 general election is part of the Turkish government’s policy to criminalize political opposition,” said Tom Porteous, deputy program director at Human Rights Watch. “The last few years provide ample evidence that Turkey’s courts are all too quick to do the government’s bidding, and this is the latest example.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Police arrested the politicians and officials on September 25, 2020 in connection with an Ankara prosecutor’s investigation of their alleged involvement in protests in southeastern Turkey that turned violent and led to at least 37 deaths. The protests, between October 6 and October 8, 2014, were a reaction to the Turkish government’s policy at the time toward the ISIS siege of the north Syrian town of Kobane and began as an expression of solidarity with the Kurds of Kobane. The government has made repeated statements holding the Peoples’ Democratic Party responsible for the deaths that occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the 20 people accused in the present case were at the time serving members of the central executive committee of the Peoples’ Democratic Party, the party’s main decision-making body. The Ankara prosecutor’s investigation accuses them of attempting to destroy the unity of the state, membership in the armed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and carrying out activities on its behalf, spreading terrorist propaganda, inciting and praising criminal activity, and inciting murder.\n",
      "\n",
      "The penalty, if convicted for attempting to destroy the unity of the state (separatism), is life in prison without parole. The evidence that the prosecutor has so far presented against the 20 in the ongoing criminal investigation consists of the party’s social media postings on Twitter calling on people to join the October 2014 demonstrations. The prosecutor alleges that the postings are evidence that the party was acting under PKK orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those detained is Ayhan Bilgen, the popular elected mayor of Kars Municipality in eastern Turkey. After his detention, the authorities announced that he had been replaced as mayor by the Ankara-appointed governor of the province, part of a government pattern, documented by Human Rights Watch, of replacing the democratically elected mayors from the Peoples’ Democratic Party with their own unelected appointees.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The government’s new detention orders are also a pretext for the government’s takeover of another Peoples’ Democratic Party municipality,” Porteous said. “Out of the 65 municipalities the party won in the March 31, 2019 local elections, the government has left just six small local councils HDP-controlled.”\n",

      "I. Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "Decisions about contraception and abortion are difficult, deeply personal, and sometimes wrenching.In Argentina, women are routinely prevented from making such decisions.Despite important advances in the area of women's political participation and economic independence, doctors and spouses continue to exercise control over women's reproductive health through laws and policies that subject female decision-making to arbitrary extraneous interference.Historically, successive governments have legislated on matters related to contraception and abortion as if women were instruments of reproduction and not equal human beings, contributing to an underlying sense among service providers and policy makers that birth control and reproductive health care are somehow illegitimate, immoral, or even illegal.The consequences for women's health and lives are serious, sometimes literally fatal.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Argentina's current government is making important strides toward addressing a number of the abuses exposed in this report, its efforts to date continue at times to be undermined by public health officials who are opposed to reform, or who fear retribution if they implement the needed reforms.\n",
      "\n",
      "As detailed in this report, women who want to use contraceptives face a series of imposing, sometimes insurmountable restrictions and obstacles. These barriers include domestic and sexual violence at the hands of intimate partners which authorities are not moving aggressively enough to prevent and remedy. Another obstacle is blatantly inaccurate or misleading information, too often propagated by health care workers themselves. A third is that many poor women simply cannot afford contraceptives and government promises of assistance are often not reaching those who need it most.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some women told us that their abusive partners or husbands deliberately sabotaged their access to contraceptives.\"He always told me: 'I am going to fill you up with children so that you can't leave my side,'\" said Gladis Morello, a thirty-two-year-old mother-of-eight from Buenos AiresProvince.Others said that public health officials themselves at times provided inaccurate information or did too little to combat misinformation spread by opponents of contraception and abortion.Paola Mndez, a thirty-five-year-old mother-of-ten from Buenos AiresProvince said: \"I wanted to get an IUD, but [t]he doctor himself explained to me that the majority [of newborns of women who have used IUDs]are born with the IUD in their heads.\"This warning is not supported by medical evidence and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women's access to the contraceptive method of their choice is also subject to legal restrictions.Under Argentine law, voluntary access to one of the most effective forms of contraception-sterilization-is severely limited.Many public hospitals require that women obtain their husband's consent for the operation, have at least three children, and be older than thirty-five to be eligible for the surgery.These regulations are in violation of international human rights standards on privacy, nondiscrimination, and health.Some physicians and hospitals, moreover, require women to seek judicial authorization for sterilization even when they fulfill all of the requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "When women are unable or unwilling to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, the only option for many is an illegal and therefore unsafe abortion. The toll on women's health and lives is immense: unsafe abortion is the leading cause of maternal mortality in Argentina today.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You get overwhelmed by desperation,\" said Paola Mndez, \"You seek all the ways out, pills, anything.But if there is no way out, then you take a knife or a knitting needle.\"In Argentina, more than 40 percent of all pregnancies end in illegal abortions, indicating women's lack of opportunity to control their fertility and health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch also found that women in Argentina received inhumane and sometimes grossly inadequate treatment when they sought medical assistance for incomplete abortions or infections due to unsafe abortions.A social worker from Santa FeProvince told us: \"A woman [we work with] went to the [public] hospital in a very bad state with an abortion and she was infected and hemorrhaging.A doctor started to examine her, and when he started to see her and realized, he threw down his instruments on the floor.He said: 'This is an abortion, you go ahead and die!'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2003, the government began implementing a much-needed national program on reproductive health.This program is intended in particular to address poor women's economic obstacles to accessing contraceptives by distributing certain contraceptive methods for free in the public health sector.It is also meant to address regional differences in access to contraceptives, in that the national government, through the program, commits to providing all needed and publicly approved contraceptive devices to those provinces who wish to take part in the program.\n",
      "\n",
      "After continued pressure from civil society and previous promises from the government, in April 2005 the national health ministry launched an information campaign to inform the general public about the reproductive health services available through the national program, including characterizing access to contraceptives and counseling as a legal right.Previously, in October 2004, the health ministries from all the Argentine provinces had committed to reduce maternal mortality in the country, inter alia through the provision of humane, fast, and effective post-abortion care, and through guaranteeing access to safe abortions where they are not penalized by law.As this report went to press, in late May 2005, the national government was planning to publish a guide on how to provide humane post-abortion care and distribute it to heads of maternity wards in public hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government's demonstrated resolve to realize women's right to make independent decisions about their reproduction and health, however, has so far failed to reach the women who most need assistance.This has happened for a number of reasons. First, authorities have not devoted sufficient attention to the barriers to accessing contraceptives faced by women who want to use them, such as for example domestic violence. Second, critical laws and policies are not being implemented.Public health officials continue to charge for contraceptive methods that, according to the law, should be free, and women have severely limited access to those abortion procedures that are not subject to criminal penalties: where the life or health of the pregnant woman is in danger, and where the pregnancy is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman.Third, current laws continue to arbitrarily limit women's control of their fertility and discourage necessary health care, including by restricting access to voluntary tubal ligation and abortion, and by requiring medical doctors to report to national authorities when women seek life-saving post-abortion care.While effective implementation of existing laws, policies, and programs could go a long way toward addressing the concrete harms described in this report, legal reform is essential in the long run.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opponents of contraceptives and abortion in Argentina sometimes argue that international human rights law as integrated into Argentina's constitution protects the \"right to life\" of the fetus and therefore requires the criminalization of abortion.The law does no such thing. International human rights legal instruments ratified by Argentina guarantee women's rights to life, physical integrity, health, nondiscrimination, privacy, information, freedom of religion and conscience, equal protection under the law, and the right to make independent decisions about the number and spacing of children.Taken together, this body of law, including directly relevant interpretations of this law by authoritative U.N. expert bodies, compels the conclusion that women have a right to decide in matters relating to abortion. The only regional human rights instrument that explicitly contemplates the application of the right to life from the moment of conception-the American Convention on Human Rights-contains qualifying language specifically intended by the founders of the convention, including Argentina, to allow for non-restrictive domestic abortion legislation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Safe and legal abortion is essential to women's health and autonomy and would be the most direct way to stop the loss of life and other preventable health effects of illegal, unregulated abortion in Argentina today.Even those who favor Argentina's restrictive legal regime on abortion, however, should be given pause by the cases described in this report.Given the extent of the harm and the number of women whose health and lives are destroyed as a result of current laws and practices, Human Rights Watch believes it is incumbent on all parties concerned, whatever their position on abortion, to give priority to ensuring women's independent control of their own fertility through the provision of accurate contraceptive information and full range of contraceptive methods.Priority should also be given to make sure that all women, including those suffering health consequences after an illegal abortion, receive humane and adequate health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Argentina as in many other countries, the public debate on abortion and even contraceptives and sex education has sometimes included arguments and accusations that are unworthy of a democratic society.Decisions related to contraceptives and abortion are complicated and socially contested.They are, however, also a question of human rights.It is almost twenty years since Argentina joined the international community of democratic states after a painful military dictatorship and on that occasion ratified some of the most important international human rights treaties.It is more than ten years since these treaties gained constitutional force in Argentina.It is time to have a debate about contraceptives and abortion, and to have it in a civilized manner.Human Rights Watch intends this report to further such debate.\n",
      "\n",
      "As this report was being finalized, in late May 2005, important reforms-such as the distribution and implementation of new guidelines on humane post-abortion care-were about to commence.This report illustrates the urgent need for these reforms, and the essential nature of further government action in the area of reproductive rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report is based on field research in Argentina in September and October 2004, as well as prior and subsequent research.A Human Rights Watch staff member conducted in-depth interviews with more than forty women and one girl who had experienced problems in accessing contraceptives or who had undergone illegal and unsafe abortions.These interviews took place in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Tucumn, and Santa Fe.All names and identifying information of the women interviewed have been changed to protect their privacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "These persons were identified largely with the assistance of Argentine NGOs and grassroots organizations providing services and support to low income women, women affected by domestic or sexual violence, and women living with HIV/AIDS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch also interviewed more than seventy representatives of government agencies, the United Nations, and NGOs specializing in women's rights or reproductive health; academics; religious officials; and public healthcare workers and hospital administrators.Certain identifying information has been withheld for some respondents for privacy reasons.All documents cited in this report are either publicly available or on file with Human Rights Watch, as noted.\n",

      "\n",
      "Publicly support women's rights to immediate unhindered access to safe abortion where the punishment is currently waived, and support legislative reform to facilitate women's access to voluntary and safe abortion services.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the National Health and Environment Ministry (Ministerio de Salud y Ambiente de la Nacin)\n",
      "\n",
      "Until such time as the Argentine Congress decriminalizes access to abortion, the National Health and Environment Ministry should develop a regulatory framework to guarantee access to voluntary safe abortion where the pregnant women's life or health is in danger, and where the pregnancy is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman, as provided by law.This regulatory framework should make explicit reference to the internationally accepted definition of \"health\" as put forward by the World Health Organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue to distribute the Guide on Better Post Abortion Care, and develop a mandatory regulatory framework for the provision of humane post-abortion care, and require all health care providers, public as well as private, to provide such care.The ministry should ensure that all women know and understand that they will be provided with humane post-abortion care at public and private health centers and hospitals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue and expand efforts to promote and disseminate full and accurate information on all safe contraceptive methods as identified by the World Health Organization, including through public information campaigns targeting the general population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Provide the full range of contraceptives in public health care centers as well as hospitals.Decisions on which methods to use should rest with the individual woman herself, on the basis of scientifically informed medical counseling.A full range of safe contraception would include surgical contraception, such as tubal ligation, and emergency contraception (the \"morning-after pill\").\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustain and deepen the public information campaign on the contents of the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation, and the services provided through the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proactively investigate and sanction all health personnel who willfully provide inaccurate or incomplete information on contraceptive methods, including those who withhold information on specific contraceptive methods, or who do not follow ministerial guidelines on the provision of care.Sanctions should include the suspension or revocation of medical licenses for repeat offenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eliminate all discriminatory preconditions for access to voluntary tubal ligation, including spousal consent.Develop a national regulatory framework for access to tubal ligations according to World Health Organization standards on this type of contraceptive method.\n",
      "\n",
      "To the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Ministerio de Educacin, Ciencia y Tecnologa)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure access to accurate science-based sex education in primary and secondary schools, both private and public.Sex education-tailored appropriately to age level and capacity-should include information on the inequality between men and women that hampers women's rights to health and to independent decision-making on reproductive and sexual health matters.It should also include accurate, science-based information about HIV prevention, including the use of condoms for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure the inclusion of comprehensive information on reproductive and sexual rights in university and higher education curricula for medical doctors, nurses, obstetricians, and other health personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "To Congress\n",
      "\n",
      "The Argentine congress should without delay:\n",
      "\n",
      "Legalize and ensure access to voluntary surgical contraception, including tubal ligation, including through the repeal of provisions in national law 17.132/67 (on the medical profession) and the penal code that limit such access.The law should clarify that women do not require spousal or judicial authorization to access any form of contraceptive method.\n",
      "\n",

      "III. Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Women's Political, Economic, and Social Status\n",
      "\n",
      "During the 1980s and 1990s, the women's movement in Argentina fought for and won important advances in many areas linked to women's status and participation in society on equal footing with men.In 1991, the Argentine congress-under pressure from women's rights activists and strongly supported by women politicians-approved a \"quota law\" requiring political parties to present at least 30 percent women as candidates for seats they were likely to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 1994 constitutional reform reinforced these advances, establishing a constitutional right to equal opportunity in political participation for men and women, guaranteed by positive measures.The constitutional reform also established a general duty of the national congress to \"legislate and promote positive action measures that guarantee real equal opportunities and treatment and the full enjoyment and exercise of the [all] rights recognized in this Constitution and by the international human rights treaties in force, in particular with regard to women.\"These reforms have been successful in ensuring the growing political representation of women.In 2003, women represented 31 percent of parliamentarians and 8 percent of government ministers, compared to 6 and 0 percent, respectively, in 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women in Argentina have also entered the formal workforce in stronger numbers than, for example, their counterparts in neighboring Chile.In both Chile and Argentina, women represented little over 35 percent of salaried non-agriculture workers in 1991.However, in 2001, women in Argentina represented almost 43 percent of all salaried non-agriculture workers, compared with only a little over 35 percent in Chile. By May 2003 there was little difference in average access to education in Argentina between men and women or boys and girls, and United Nations statistics from 2001 set the literacy level for both men and women at over 98 percent.Although many women in Argentina continue to work in temporary jobs without job security and to earn less than men for similar jobs, their increasing economic independence has been essential in advancing women's rights in general.\n",
      "\n",
      "A strong women's movement in Argentina has been paramount to the advancement of women's rights.For almost two decades, Argentine women from grassroots organizations, NGOs, political parties, and neighborhood groups of very diverse interests and ideologies have come together for an annual meeting of workshops, talks, and campaign coordination: the Annual Women's Meeting.In 2004, this meeting drew more than 10,000 women to MendozaProvince, and the year before a similar number of women met in Rosario in Santa FeProvince.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite advances in women's political and economic status, and despite continuous efforts, it has taken Argentina's women's movement decades to obtain even minimal advances in women's right to access modern contraception and essential health information.Though low compared to the region as a whole, Argentina's maternal mortality rate is substantially higher than that of the neighboring countries closest to Argentina in their level of material development.Though other factors, including overall access to health care services, play an important role, the high maternal mortality rates in Argentina reflect the prevalence of illegal, unregulated abortion, which in turn is a product of barriers to contraceptives and women's lack of control of their fertility and over decisions on the number and spacing of their children.Illegal abortion has long constituted the main cause of maternal mortality in Argentina as a whole, causing a third of maternal deaths.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nationalism and Women's Role as Childbearers\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the South American region, many governments and legislators have historically declared their opposition to modern birth control methods, usually with reference to Catholic church doctrine.However, in Argentina the government went so far as to prohibit the sale of all contraceptives for several decades in the late twentieth century-an extreme display of opposition to birth control even by regional standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "This position is only partially explained by reference to Catholic church doctrine.Historically, a central part of the identity of the political elite in Argentina has been that of a frontier nation to be colonized and populated by Caucasian immigrants from Europe.The most famous expression of this identity is the phrase \"to rule is to populate\" attributed to Juan Bautista Alberdi, a central figure in Argentina's political history known as the \"father of the Argentine constitution.\"Indeed, the Argentine constitution charges the federal government with the active encouragement of European immigration.Over the years-most recently during a 1995 congressional debate on legal access to contraception-the refrain \"to rule is to populate\" has been used by various political actors to justify the limitations on women's reproductive autonomy and rights, by reference to women's essential role as childbearers and-as such-tools for population growth.This pro-natalist approach has historically set Argentina apart from the rest of South America, so much so that Argentina in 1996 was the only country in the region to provide no public support of any kind for access to contraception, and in 2001 the only country to provide no direct support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government opposition to contraceptives and information about contraception began in 1974, before Argentina's seven-year military dictatorship (1976-1983).The opposition gathered force during the military dictatorship, and even continued more than a decade after the democratic government in the mid-80s ratified human rights treaties that protect women's right to make independent decisions about their health and lives.In 1974, the Pern government issued a decree prohibiting the sale of contraceptives as well as any other activities related to voluntary birth control, limiting the possibility of providing information and services. These measures affected mostly individuals and families with low incomes, since those with financial resources had access to services in other countries. The ban continued in effect during the military government as well as after the military junta relinquished power in 1983.It was finally repealed in 1985, after Argentina ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).Another seventeen years had to pass before Argentina's government place reproductive and sexual health on the national political agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "The topic of access to contraceptives continued to generate controversy in the 1990s.In 1995, a draft bill on reproductive health and state obligations regarding the distribution of contraceptives was debated and passed by the House of Representatives, but the Senate never took it up for debate, apparently considering it too contentious.In 1999, President Carlos Mnem declared March 25 to be a national \"Day of the Unborn Child\" in an obvious nod to those who opposed contraceptive methods and access to safe abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only in 2002 did the Argentine congress enact meaningful reform, overcoming vocal opposition from the Catholic church as well as several conservative legislators to pass the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation.Though the law is far from perfect and has been criticized as minimalist by many women's rights activists, it contains important provisions for the advancement of women's rights and health.Indeed, two main objectives of this law-to guarantee access to sexual health information and to contraceptive methods and related health services for everyone-would, if fully implemented, go a long way to overcome some of the violations documented in this report.However, the text of the law does not tackle the arbitrary and discriminatory denial of surgical contraception (tubal ligation), nor does it address women's severely limited access to safe and legal abortion services.The government promulgated regulations for the law's implementation in May 2003, and the law had therefore been in force for little more than a year when Human Rights Watch conducted its research for this report.This law placed reproductive and sexual health on the national political agenda for the first time in Argentina's history.The law also brought Argentina up to par with other countries in the region-including Chile and Mexico-where national reproductive health programs already had been implemented.\n",
      "\n",
      "While women in Argentina thus have seen some advances in access to modern contraceptives, access to abortion continues to be largely a closed topic despite the catastrophic effects of illegal abortion on women's health and lives.Abortion has long constituted a crime in Argentina.When legislators have amended the penal code provisions on abortion, they have done so with little concern for women's rights but instead to address the scope of doctors' discretion in deciding when they might perform an abortion without risking a prison sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the current penal code entered into force in the late 1880s, abortion was included as a crime with no exceptions. In 1922, while abortion was still illegal in all circumstances, the penal code provisions on abortion were amended to allow for three exceptions: punishment was lifted where the pregnant woman's life or health was in danger, where the pregnancy was the result of the rape, or where the pregnant woman was mentally disabled.During the 1976-1983 dictatorship, the penal code was changed to include further restrictions on abortion, requiring \"grave\" danger to a woman's life or health, and, in the case of rape, the commencement of criminal proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1984, after the reinstatement of a democratic government in Argentina, the provisions on abortion were amended again to return to the 1922 wording, with one small but substantive difference: a comma in the text was moved.The effect of this change was that women whose pregnancies were the result of a rape were no longer permitted a nonpunishable abortion unless they were mentally disabled.As a result, the current penal code provides for only two exceptions to punishment: where the pregnant woman's life or health is in danger, or where the pregnancy is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman. These restrictions remain in force as of May 2005.In 2004, there were several bills pending in Argentina's congress, all of which seek to amend the current penal code provisions to expand or limit the situations where penalties for abortion may be waived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this history, in 2004 and 2005 there has been unprecedented public debate on the topic of abortion and equally unprecedented government will to address one of the most heart-wrenching violations documented in this report: the provision of inhumane post-abortion care.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent public debate on abortion was fuelled by, among other things, the government's 2004 nomination of a female judge, Carmen Argibay, who publicly announced her support for the decriminalization of abortion.Judge Argibay's appointment to the National Supreme Court was approved by the Senate despite protests from the Catholic church and conservative groups, and was confirmed by President Nestor Kirchner.Additionally, Argentina's health minister indicated publicly that he thought women's health and lives probably would improve if abortion were decriminalized.In response, Kichner was quick to emphasize that the government's position continued to be a \"clear rejection of the legalization of abortion.\"However, Kirchner also defended his government's health minister against subsequent attacks from the Catholic church, including by asking the Vatican to retire a bishop who had suggested the health minister should be thrown into the sea with a stone around his neck for his comments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Health and Environment Ministry has also, under constant pressure from women's rights activists and health advocates, spearheaded an attempt to guarantee women access to adequate and humane post-abortion care without fear of legal prosecution, publicly recognizing the toll on women's health and lives of illegal and unsafe abortions.In October 2004, Argentina's provincial health ministries signed an agreement with the National Health and Environment Ministry on the measures that must be taken in order to lower maternal mortality in Argentina.This agreement included a commitment to ensure that \"women who are aborting are not discriminated against and that they receive humane, fast, and effective assistance, with counseling and the provision of contraceptives.\"In May 2005, the national government announced the publication of a new guide for doctors on how to provide such assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The agreement signed by the provincial health ministries also included a commitment to \"guarantee access to nonpunishable abortion services [i.e. where abortion is not penalized by the penal code] in public hospitals in fulfillment of the penal code's provisions [on abortion].\"There are no ministerial guidelines on how public hospitals should provide such services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Catholic Church Opposition to Reproductive Rights\n",
      "\n",
      "In Argentina, government policies and personal decisions on reproductive matters are developed in a context with substantial contributions from religious teachings and organizations, in particular the Catholic church.The Catholic church as well as groups claiming inspiration from Catholic church teachings have, with varying degrees of success, sought to block advances on reproductive health by lobbying the national and several provincial congresses, seeking judicial injunctions against the implementation of policies and laws that advance women's rights to health and nondiscrimination, and publicly attacking politicians and NGO representatives who support such advances.\n",
      "\n",
      "All NGO representatives, elected officials, and government health officials Human Rights Watch interviewed mentioned the impact of efforts by the Catholic church to block the implementation of policies and laws on access to contraceptives, information on reproductive health, and sex education.Graciela Rosso, deputy minister of health, noted: \"The Pope himself has asked us to repeal the law [on reproductive health].\"A member of the national house of representatives who was a member of the Santa FeProvince congress when the provincial law on sexual health was debated told Human Rights Watch: \"When we were debating the law, all the representatives received a letter from the archbishop threatening us even with excommunication [if we voted for the law].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In October and December 2004, ultra-conservative groups who identify with Catholic church teachings reportedly engaged in violent opposition to women's organizing in support of reproductive rights.Catholic church officials told Human Rights Watch in October 2004 that they did not condone the violence and vandalism carried out during the Annual Women's Meeting that same month, and that they believed the criminal acts might have been carried out by the organizers of the meeting themselves-in particular lesbians and transvestites-in order to incriminate the Catholic church.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Argentine Catholic church has focused its advocacy in three areas: staunch opposition to nearly all forms of modern contraception, to sex education, and to abortion.At the heart of this opposition lie views about women's role in the family, and about maternity and reproduction as key parts of women's identity.Increasingly, however, Catholic church officials have sought to justify their faith-based opposition to contraception and abortion in less doctrinal and more \"pragmatic\" terms, such as \"scientific\" proof that condoms prevent neither pregnancy nor sexually transmitted infections or nationalist concerns with population size and growth.Bishop Horacio Ernesto Benites Astoul from Buenos Aires told Human Rights Watch directly that he, as a nationalist, did not see the need to curb population growth in Argentina.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition to Modern Contraceptive Methods\n",
      "\n",
      "In Argentina, Catholic church officials generally do not express opposition to all modern contraceptive methods, but instead engage in a dual strategy, expressing support for \"transitional, reversible, and non-abortive\" contraceptive methods, while seeking to brand modern contraceptive methods as either non-transitional (i.e. permanent), irreversible, or tantamount to abortion.This strategy has been quite successful on two counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the Catholic church's concerns about \"transitional, reversible, and non-abortive\" contraception became part of the congressional record during the 2001 congressional debate on the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation, as a congressional member read into the record a letter from a Catholic bishop to this effect.The terms subsequently were included in the law, which stipulates that the public health system must \"prescribe and provide contraceptive methods and elements that must be of a reversible, non-abortive, and transitional character.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the Catholic church and affiliated groups have successfully advanced the position in courts that many contraceptive methods are abortive.In 2002, the National Supreme Court, in a case brought by the group \"Portal de Beln\" (The Portal of Bethlehem), prohibited the manufacture and sale of \"IMEDIAT,\" the brand name of an emergency contraceptive pill.Five of the court's nine members deemed the pill abortive and therefore unconstitutional.Several other lawsuits brought by conservative groups inspired by Catholic church teachings have focused on the definition of \"abortion\" and on the contested constitutionality of specific contraceptive methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs), oral contraceptives, and hormonal injections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition to Sex Education\n",
      "\n",
      "The Catholic church and many conservative groups have also successfully limited provisions of the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation that call for some advance on sex education and information on contraception, as well as draft laws and policies seeking to provide such access, in particular for adolescents.A lawyer from the Argentine Association on Family Planning, an NGO, lamented: \"The opposition [from the Catholic church] is so intense that you can't even have a serious debate. [The schools] teach the topic of anatomy, but nothing that goes into the more sexual issues.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition to sex education has been successful.For example, in Santa FeProvince, a law that mandates sex education in all private and public schools was adopted in 1992, but never implemented.\"It got shelved,\" said Horacio de la Torre, coordinator of Santa Fe provincial government's program on responsible procreation.\"It was never implemented for reasons related to the church.\"The law was still on the books unimplemented when Human Rights Watch visited Santa FeProvince in September 2004, more than ten years after the adoption of the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a component of civil society, the Catholic church has a right to freedom of religion and expression, regardless of the scientific or medical accuracy of the claims it makes.The Argentine government, however, has an obligation to ensure access to complete and accurate information concerning prevailing health problems, their prevention and their control.Where incomplete or inaccurate information is readily available in the public sphere-for example because it is provided by the Catholic church or other civil society entities exercising their right to freedom of expression-the state may have a responsibility to launch an affirmative public health information campaign specifically aimed at correcting the misperceptions.In April 2005 the national government did launch a public information campaign aimed at disseminating information on access to contraceptives through public hospitals and clinics.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Pervasive Barriers in Access to Contracepti ves\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch identified three primary barriers to women's access to contraceptives: domestic and sexual violence, the provision of inaccurate and inadequate information by public health officials, and economic constraints, including at times unauthorized fees for contraceptives and related health services that should have been free of charge under the National Law on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic and Sexual Violence\n",
      "\n",
      "I was with him for fourteen years.He beat me [and] the mistreatment had become normal. He always told me: \"I am going to fill you with children so that you can't leave my side.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "-Gladis Morello, age thirty-two, Buenos AiresProvince\n",
      "\n",
      "Domestic and sexual violence constitute a persistent barrier for women trying to access contraceptives and to control their bodies and reproductive health.Olga Cceres, president of a nongovernmental organization that provides shelter for battered women in Buenos Aires Province, told Human Rights Watch: \"The large majority of the women in the shelter live with violence, [including] sexual violence.In those cases, there is no freedom to decide how many children you want to have, or even when you are going to have sex.\"Cceres explained that a significant number of abusive men deliberately sabotage their wife's or partner's access to contraceptives as part of the control and abuse: \"If he gets her pregnant constantly, there is less possibility that she will leave [the abusive relationship].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The testimony of Romina Casillas, a forty-six-year-old mother of seven, presents one such example.She suffered physical violence at the hands of her husband, who prevented her from using contraceptives: \"I didn't want to have that many [children] but he didn't let me [use contraceptives]. ... I would start on the pills when he was away, and he would hide them when he came back. ... I wanted to get an IUD [intrauterine device], but he wouldn't let me. ... I never thought that I would have many children, I thought that I would have four at the most.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1999, an estimated 25 percent of all women in Argentina suffered domestic violence on a regular basis, while 50 percent were estimated to suffer some form of gender-related violence at some point in their lives.Of the forty-three women Human Rights Watch interviewed, more than half testified that they had suffered, or were currently suffering, domestic or sexual violence at the hands of their partners.The reasons for pervasive domestic violence are many and complex, not all of which the state is directly responsible for.However, international human rights standards set out specific minimum steps that states must take in order to comply with their obligation to eradicate domestic violence as a form of gender-based discrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The CEDAW Committee, which monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, noted in its General Recommendation No. 19 on Violence against Women that \"[g]ender-based violence is a form of discrimination that seriously inhibits women's ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on a basis of equality with men.\"In the same document, the committee spelled out specific obligations in terms of preventing violence against women, recommending:\n",
      "\n",
      "States parties should ensure that laws against family violence and abuse, rape, sexual assault and other gender-based violence give adequate protection to all women, and respect their integrity and dignity. Appropriate protective and support services should be provided for victims. Gender-sensitive training of judicial and law enforcement officers and other public officials is essential for the effective implementation of the Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, a body of fifty-three states that meets annually to issue recommendations on human rights, has emphasized \"that violence against women has an impact on their reproductive and sexual health\" and has encouraged states \"to ensure that women have access to health care providers who are knowledgeable and trained to recognize signs of violence against women and to meet the needs of patients who have been subjected to violence, in order to minimize the adverse physical and psychological consequences of violence.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), which monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), has noted that \"to eliminate discrimination against women, there is a need to develop and implement a comprehensive national strategy for promoting women's right to health\" of which \"[a] major goal should be reducing women's health risks, particularly lowering rates of maternal mortality and protecting women from domestic violence.\"The Committee has further noted that \"the realization of women's right to health requires the removal of all barriers interfering with access to health services, education and information, including in the area of sexual and reproductive health.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In Argentina, a 1994 domestic violence law established protective measures for victims of domestic violence, including restraining orders and temporary paternity support.In April 1999, the Argentine congress amended penal code provisions on \"crimes against sexual integrity\" to bring them more in line with international legal standards, but did not explicitly criminalize marital rape.NGOs have criticized this clear deficiency of the law, and the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has expressed concern that these legal reforms have not prevented the domestic violence problem in Argentina from worsening.Lucila Morn, a twenty-two-year-old woman who was pregnant for the second time when Human Rights Watch interviewed her, was beaten by her husband almost daily.Morn said that she could not leave her abusive relationship, as her husband repeatedly threatened her with keeping their two-year-old daughter:\n",
      "\n",
      "He beats me for anything.The other day, he almost killed me. I filed a complaint about him one time, but they [the police] told me that they couldn't help me with anything.They gave me a restraining order [but he did not leave]. I don't have help from anyone. [My husband] says: 'If you want to leave, go, but you are leaving my daughter here.'And so he has me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morn's situation was further complicated by the local public hospital's refusal to give her a tubal ligation-due to discriminatory hospital regulations-despite a heart condition that her doctor said makes pregnancy a health hazard for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "A community educator working with low income women affected by violence in Buenos Aires Province told Human Rights Watch that the government's response to domestic violence, in particular that of police officers, was seriously deficient:\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to violence, so much needs to happen. If they [the women] don't go to the police with the law in their hands, [the police] doesn't take the complaint. Because they start asking you why he hit you, and let's see if he really hit you. Sometimes they don't even want to take down a testimony, or they take your testimony, but they don't file the complaint.There are many police stations, but none of them file the complaint.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fundamental deficiency in the state's response to violence is the lack of shelters for women affected by domestic and sexual violence.A community organizer from Santa Fe Province told Human Rights Watch: \"There are two state institutions [in Santa Fe City] that deal with this subject [domestic violence], but they don't have anywhere to send the women so that they are not killed.Because they are killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation only addresses violence in passing, and implementing regulations offer no specifics as to how to prevent intimate partner violence from posing an obstacle to women's independent decision-making in the area of reproductive health.The vast majority of the public hospitals and clinics implementing the program that Human Rights Watch visited were not required or encouraged to detect domestic or sexual violence in patients and counsel patients on these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Misleading, Inaccurate, or Incomplete Information\n",
      "\n",
      "The women Human Rights Watch interviewed had limited access to contraceptives for a host of reasons, some of which had to do with a generalized level of misinformation regarding reproduction and contraception.Mara del Huerto Terceiro, a lawyer from a policy organization working on access to family planning, lamented: \"There is no permanent information, and there is no sex education in the schools.The result is that you continue to be uninformed.\"In April 2005, Argentina's government started addressing this issue, notably through the launch of a public information campaign in television, radio, and print press, announcing access to contraceptives as a right, and referring individuals and couples to public health centers for further information.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the central government's demonstrated political will does not always overcome fear and opposition from the public officials who are directly responsible for women's enjoyment of their human rights in the reproductive area.We found that public health officials at times contributed to the existing lack of understanding by providing women with misleading, incomplete, or inaccurate information about contraception.Women we interviewed were often badly placed to demand more accurate or complete information, either because they were unaware that they were being misinformed, or because they did not feel in a position to challenge a medical authority.Considering the disadvantaged economic position of most users of public health facilities, and a related disadvantage in access to education and information, public health officials, as detailed below, did not show the kind of commitment necessary to ensure that women receive essential health information. The net result was that women many times were left with severely limited choices with regard to when and if to have children, even within the already limited range of contraceptive methods legally available to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch found that, in many cases, public health officials offered women access to a more limited range of contraceptives than permitted by law or distributed by the government.Some women testified that doctors in the public health system actively discouraged them from using the contraceptives donated by the state, either by telling them that the contraceptives were not of good quality, or by giving misinformation about some methods.\"I went to a gynecologist [and] I opted for the pill.But then she said that after [taking the pill] I would have to have treatment to become pregnant again, and that it wasn't worth it,\" recalled Mara Rivara, thirty-seven, who had eight children.Paola Mndez, thirty-five and mother of ten, wanted to get an intrauterine device (IUD), but the public health doctor told her that it would not prevent pregnancies, and that it might, in fact, damage a future child: \"I wanted to get an IUD, but you know they say that many are born with the IUD in their heads.The doctor himself explained to me that the majority, almost all of them, are born with the IUD in their heads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In other cases, women were not told about side effects that may render certain contraceptive methods ineffective, such as use of antibiotics while on hormonal contraception.In the case of Laura Passaglia, thirty-two, a doctor in the public health system prescribed antibiotics to her without informing her that this treatment was likely to interfere with the effectiveness of the hormonal contraception he also prescribed to her on a monthly basis.Passaglia said: \"I took the [contraceptive] pill.But I got pregnant all the same. I was always on antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. They never told me anything about that [that antibiotics may interfere with the contraceptive actions of the pills].\"While taking hormonal contraception, Passaglia had five unwanted pregnancies, in addition to her existing three children and one miscarriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch did not interview any medical doctors who admitted to misinforming patients about contraceptive methods.However, the vast majority of the doctors we interviewed expressed some variant of the idea that they were better placed than the women they treat to make decisions about how the women should control their fertility.Lus Robles, head of the maternity program at FormosaProvince health ministry told Human Rights Watch that the hospitals in that province routinely injected women with hormonal contraception without ensuring consent, in a blatant violation of women's right to bodily integrity.Robles noted that this practice was particularly common when the women were hospitalized for post-abortion care, because in those cases it was assumed that the woman had deliberately refused to use contraceptives: \"A woman [who is hospitalized for post-abortion care] has used abortion as contraception.[When she] is discharged, we give her contraception. Whether she wants it or not, we inform her, and inject her.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Human Rights Watch did not interview women from FormosaProvince, our interviews from elsewhere in the country suggested that many women with unwanted pregnancies-whether or not they ended in illegal and unsafe abortions-had been prevented from using any type of contraception due to abusive relationships, insufficient information, or lack of financial resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "Robles' comment illustrates the fact that many competing factors impede women's possibility to make informed and independent decisions about their contraceptive use.Whereas most women Human Rights Watch interviewed were denied information about a full range of contraceptive methods in the public health system, some noted that doctors prescribed contraceptives \"as if they were aspirin\" to women with more than three children, regardless of the individual woman's desire to have more children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has interpreted the \"right to prevention, treatment and control of diseases\" to impose a positive obligation on states parties to take steps necessary for the \"prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, occupational and other diseases,\" including the \"establishment of prevention and education programmes for behaviour-related health concerns such as those adversely affecting sexual and reproductive health.\"According to the committee, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health includes the right to information and education concerning prevailing health problems, their prevention and their control.In the context of \"specific legal obligations,\" the committee notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "States should refrain from limiting access to contraceptives and other means of maintaining sexual and reproductive health, from censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting health-related information, including sexual education and information, as well as from preventing people's participation in health-related matters. . . . States should also ensure that third parties do not limit people's access to health-related information and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, accurate and full information on contraception and sexual health should be understood as being contained in the right to the highest attainable standard of health protected by article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child has explained that this right extends to adolescent girls.The Convention on the Rights of the Child, which under Argentine law is incorporated into the constitution, recognizes the right of children to enjoy \"the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.\" According to the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child which interprets the convention, adolescents \"have the right to access adequate information essential for their health and development and for their ability to participate meaningfully in society.\"This implies that states parties have an obligation \"to ensure that all adolescent girls and boys, both in and out of school, are provided with, and not denied, accurate and appropriate information on how to protect their health and development and practise healthy behaviours [including] information on safe and respectful social and sexual behaviours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Accurate information on contraception would seem particularly important in the Argentine context, where 17.5 percent of all infants were born to adolescent mothers in 2003 and 34 percent of adolescents did not use any type of contraception during their first sexual intercourse according to a 2004 poll.Indeed, Argentina's health minister has acknowledged the importance of sex education on several occasions, always drawing vehement opposition from conservative groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic Constraints\n",
      "\n",
      "Women Human Rights Watch interviewed identified their poverty as a decisive factor in their inability to access contraceptives and thus to exercise independent decision-making about if and when to have children.The government has recognized some dimensions of this problem.In fact, one of the main stated objectives of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation is to provide all legal contraceptive methods free of charge through the public health system.This policy, however, is not being implemented effectively and many poor women still are made to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of the women Human Rights Watch interviewed testified that public health workers charged them for services that should have been free under the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation.\"The state gives you the IUD [intrauterine device] for free, but they charge you for the checkup, 15 pesos [U.S.$5.05]\" said Norma Jimnez, thirty-five, who had been pregnant six times.Paola Vsquez, a twenty-seven-year-old mother of three, had the same experience: \"There are some places [public health clinics] where they give [contraceptives] for free, and other places [public health clinics] where they don't give it for free.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When the cost of a consultation, a medical analysis, or the transport to the public hospital where the program is implemented is added to the cost of the contraceptive method itself, moreover, women we interviewed were essentially left to choose between food and shelter or paying for contraceptives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this choice, many women chose to feed themselves and their families.Romina Redondo, thirty-two, exclaimed: \"One does not have 30 pesos [U.S.$10.10] every month for an injection. Where do we get 30 pesos for an injection, when we are living off the head of household program with 150 pesos [U.S.$50.14] a month?\"Marisa Rossi, thirty-six, noted that sometimes the choice was between food and condoms: \"[Condoms] cost 2.50 pesos for three.For that money, you can buy a kilo of bread or a couple of liters of milk.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In most cases, public hospitals did not allow women to set up appointments in advance or over the phone, adding to the economic burden that the access to contraceptives represented because further travel was needed or because the women had to take time off work to go to the hospital: \"You have to go at four in the morning [and] they give you an appointment at eight, nine, ten, eleven. If you don't get an appointment, sometimes they give you one for another day,\" said Romina Casillas, forty-six.Yanina Carlotto, forty-six, asked: \"If you have to feed your children, how can you spend 2.50 pesos [U.S.$0.84] on the bus [to get to the hospital]?\"Ana Snchez, forty-three, said: \"People don't have money, even if it is a small ticket.Sometimes you don't have 3 pesos [U.S.$1.01] to come and go [to the health center], and then you have to come and go again.\"Mariana Porcel, thirty-one, said of going to the public hospital for contraceptives: \"You can't work the whole morning, you have to wait twenty appointments.And if you don't go [to work] a full day, you can't feed your children.\"Women who use hormonal contraceptives based on a monthly cycle have to repeat the ordeal of getting to the public hospital every month: \"Every month you have to go get [the pills]. They give you a card, and when you get the pills, they mark it up,\" Romina Casillas said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has addressed the issue of economic constraints in its interpretative statement on the right to health, noting that \"health facilities, goods and services must be affordable for all [ and that] poorer households should not be disproportionately burdened with health expenses as compared to richer households.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most women Human Rights Watch interviewed felt that they could not afford to have more children without compromising the welfare of their existing family, yet they were also unable to afford contraceptives.The fact that economic constraints played a significant role for the women we interviewed in deciding how many children to have is, of course, not unique to Argentina, nor is it unique to so-called developing countries.However, economic constraints on voluntary motherhood impose a particularly heavy burden on women who are simultaneously denied the right to decide freely on the use and method of contraception, and on access, when needed, to safe abortions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jazmin Castaa, a twenty-four-year-old mother of three, explained to Human Rights Watch how her decisions about if and when to have children were constrained by economic concerns.Castaa had first become pregnant at seventeen, unplanned, and had decided to continue the pregnancy \"because I don't agree with abortion.\"However, despite her personal disapproval of abortion, she felt that she would not be able to justify having another child in her current economic circumstances, should her method of contraception fail:\n",
      "\n",
      "After the last [third] child, I don't want to have any more. I work in the head of household program for 150 pesos a months [U.S.$50.14]. [My husband] drives a cab, and that is bread for today and not for tomorrow. As I am doing, there is not enough [money] to have another one.I think that if I had to do it [have an abortion], it hurts my soul and may God forgive me, but I don't know that I wouldn't do it.And I am telling you that I don't agree with abortion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The implementation of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation is an essential step in making contraceptive methods affordable to more women.However, the government needs to ensure closer oversight to ensure that public hospitals do not charge women for contraceptives and services that they are required to provide for free of charge. In addition, Human Rights Watch believes that the government should help women overcome other economic obstacles to access by facilitating the implementation of the program through primary health care centers and not-as is the case now-mostly through hospitals.Primary health care centers are generally smaller, more numerous, and geographically more spread out and therefore accessible to many more women.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the national government has plans to extend the program to primary health care centers, the program is still concentrated in hospitals.There is some evidence that key officials do not see this issue as a priority.Ins Martnez, the implementation coordinator of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation, told Human Rights Watch: \"I am not worried about [the program] existing only in hospitals, because the population itself disdains the primary health level: they prefer to go to the hospital and stand in line.\" The women Human Rights Watch interviewed stated quite clearly that this was not true in their cases.Mariana Porcel, thirty-two, said: \"They should have the conditions [to give contraceptives and services] in the health centers, now they send us to the hospitals. You can't work a whole morning. [And] if you don't go [to work] a full day, you can't feed your children.Yanina Carlotto, forty-six, noted: \"Information is the basis for everything, but also access.They [the public health system] have to get closer [to their clients].\"\n",
      "\n",
      "V. Voluntary Tubal Ligation : A Case Study in Denial of Access to Contraceptives\n",
      "\n",
      "A prime example of the inaccessibility of contraceptives is the fact that many women in Argentina are arbitrarily denied access to one of the most effective forms of contraception: voluntary tubal ligation (female surgical sterilization).Argentine law restricts access to tubal ligation to situations where the intervention is warranted by a \"therapeutic reason.\"While courts and experts have interpreted this clause in different ways, medical doctors and public health officials often cite the restrictive law as justification for denying women access to voluntary tubal ligation.Many public hospitals have formulated and implemented burdensome procedures that women must comply with to obtain a tubal ligation, in violation of authoritative interpretations of women's rights to health, to privacy, to nondiscrimination, and to decide on the number and spacing of their children. Twenty of the forty-three women Human Rights Watch interviewed were denied a voluntary tubal ligation the first time they asked, and of these, fourteen had been unable to obtain a voluntary tubal ligation altogether, often despite repeated attempts.One of the women who were initially denied the operation was later granted permission for medical reasons, and the remaining five were able to obtain a voluntary tubal ligation only after great efforts to find a \"friendly\" doctor in the public health care system who performed the operation as a \"favor.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the women we spoke to who had sought to obtain a tubal ligation were required to go through arbitrary and discriminatory procedures-including the requirement of spousal consent-as a condition for access to voluntary tubal ligation in the public health system, and the majority were denied the operation even when they fulfilled the criteria.This situation subjects women's decision-making in the most intimate area of their lives to male authority or arbitrary medical intervention.As such, it constitutes a violation of women's rights to nondiscrimination, privacy, and health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tubal Ligation and the Law\n",
      "\n",
      "The routine denial of voluntary tubal ligation in the public health system has its roots in the Legal Regime for the Exercise of Medicine, Odontology, and Collaborative Activities (henceforth \"law on the medical profession\") dating from 1967, an era of political hostility to all contraceptive methods.The law requires a \"perfectly determined therapeutic indication\" and the exhaustion of \"all possibilities to preserve the reproductive organs\" in order for it to be legal to carry out an operation that results in sterilization.In addition, some legal scholars cite penal code provisions that criminalize violence which causes permanent damage to a limb as applying to sterilization procedures.These restrictive laws are in and of themselves inconsistent with Argentina's obligations and commitments under international human rights treaties.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has advised that the right to the highest attainable standard of health-protected by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights-creates a specific legal obligation of the state to \"refrain from limiting access to contraceptives.\"Voluntary tubal ligation or female sterilization is widely accepted by medical science and international health and human rights entities as a method of contraception or birth control.In fact, the WHO has declared tubal ligation one of the most effective contraceptive methods and highly appropriate where women give meaningful informed consent and the medical conditions allow the operation.In 1999, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW Committee) clarified its position on sterilization in its concluding remarks on the periodic report of Chile:\"The Committee is concerned that [under Chilean law] a husband's consent is required for sterilization and a woman who wishes to be sterilized must already have four children.The Committee considers these provisions to violate the human rights of all women.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Government officials in Argentina confirmed that public health workers deny women access to tubal ligation not because of physical and economic constraints in the public health system, but rather because the law does not recognize tubal ligation as a valid method to control fertility.\"The law does not contemplate tubal ligation or vasectomy because they are not approved methods by the ANMAT [National Administration of Medicines, Food, and Medical Techonology],\" explained Ins Martnez, who is responsible for the coordination of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation. \"The law does not permit it, does not see it as a method of contraception.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fully consistent with international human rights standards, the law on the medical profession should be amended to allow access to safe voluntary sterilization with informed consent.The National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation should include voluntary tubal ligation and vasectomy in the spectrum of contraceptive methods offered, subject to meaningful informed consent by the person involved.The U.N. Human Rights Committee reached this conclusion in 2000, when it noted with regard to Argentina,\"women should be given access to family planning methods and sterilization procedures.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch interviewed women in three provinces-Tucumn, Santa Fe, and Buenos Aires-who had been denied access to voluntary tubal ligation, usually because health officials said it was illegal or not allowed under local hospital procedures.At the same time, it is important to note that not all public hospitals deny this form of contraceptive, and that some provinces have recently passed legislation to attempt to overcome the shortcomings in the national law.However, even where provincial law or municipal decrees make voluntary sterilization more readily available, some providers still professed fear of legal consequences.For example, two weeks after a provincial law in Santa Fe had been approved to allow for voluntary sterilization in that province, Elda Cerrano, the municipal official responsible for the implementation of the reproductive health program in Rosario in the province of Santa Fe told Human Rights Watch: \"The issue with tubal ligation is a big problem, even after the law has been passed. [The professional code] has to be amended . How can I require my people to do this if they risk having their license taken away? Until now, it has been totally prohibited.It is not written down in any code how to proceed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Women's Decisions Subject to Male Authority\n",
      "\n",
      "The criteria for women to access tubal ligation vary from one hospital to the next, but a common denominator mentioned by most women we interviewed was the spousal consent requirement.\"You have to have permission from your husband\" said Valentina Rodrguez, twenty-two.Micaela Mrquez, twenty-eight, as well as ten other women Human Rights Watch interviewed in three provinces, gave a similar testimony: \"I asked about it, and they told me that you have to have a certain age, [and] you have to have spousal authorization.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirement of spousal authorization for access to tubal ligation contravenes Argentina's obligations under CEDAW and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, both of which were incorporated into the Argentine constitution in 1994.The CEDAW Committee has spelled out that \"[d]ecisions to have children or not, while preferably made in consultation with spouse or partner, must not nevertheless be limited by spouse, parent, partner or Government.\"The Human Rights Committee has indicated that the right to privacy, protected by article 17 of the ICCPR, may be violated \"where there is a requirement for the husband's authorization to make a decision in regard to sterilization [and] where general requirements are imposed for the sterilization of women, such as having a certain number of children or being of a certain age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "When a hospital requires spousal authorization for access to certain family planning services, an unmarried woman who is denied access to these services because she cannot obtain spousal consent also experiences discrimination on the basis of her marital status.This was the case for Romina Parma, who had tried to get a tubal ligation several times, both before and after the separation from her physically and sexually abusive husband.She said: \"[To have a tubal ligation] I have to be married, I have to have authorization from my husband.But if you are not duly married, they deny it again and again.\"Parma had had eleven children and thirteen pregnancies.The doctor at a public hospital in Buenos AiresCity denied her the procedure because of the lack of spousal authorization despite the weekly and sometimes daily rapes Parma was enduring at the hands of her live-in partner and despite the adverse health consequences of other contraceptive methods for her: \"The IUD gave me enormous hemorrhaging and very bad anemia.\"Parma finally decided to live alone because she saw this as the only way to avoid having any more children.\"It has been six years since I separated,\" Parma noted, \"and I don't have a husband because I don't want any more children.\"She saw what happened to her as a great injustice: \"It is illegal that they tie your tubes. But I ask you: having ten children and being thirty years old, you might have at least fifteen children more.Is that right? Maybe it is illegal, but if I could just sign a consent form, because it is my life.Not the life of any future child, but my life, physically and mentally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Women's Decisions Subject to Arbitrary Veto by Medical Authorities\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of national regulations interpreting the law on the medical profession results in arbitrary and inconsistent implementation that often gives more weight to the views on morality of local doctors and health officials than to women's own choices in the reproductive realm.Some hospitals set up elaborate and onerous local procedures and requirements, and individual doctors sometimes deny tubal ligations even where women fulfill all specified criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many public hospitals require women to obtain prior approval from social services or family planning offices, the hospital's ethical committee, the hospital's legal advisor, or any combination thereof.\n",
      "\n",
      "The women Human Rights Watch interviewed who had asked for a tubal ligation had generally done so in connection with a cesarean section, and were under the impression that the operation could not be done unless during an already scheduled cesarean section.One woman had asked her doctor at a public hospital in Buenos AiresCity if she could have a tubal ligation without her being pregnant, and was told no.Indeed, in many countries, the most common time for tubal ligation is the immediate postpartum period because of the greater convenience, lower costs, ease of surgery, and more efficient use of health resources when the surgery is carried out at this time as opposed to any other time.Where the surgery is carried out during the same surgery session as a cesarean section, these advantages are doubly relevant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Romina Redondo, thirty-two, was pregnant with her tenth child when Human Rights Watch spoke to her.She explained that when pregnant with her eighth child, she had completed all the steps required by her local public hospital, \"Dr. Jos Mara Cullen\" hospital in Santa FeCity, to have a tubal ligation.Her doctor still denied her the operation at the last moment:\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was pregnant with the eighth child, I did all the paperwork to have a tubal ligation. A lawyer seeks the consent of the husband. When I got to the hospital, I had the paperwork with me, but the doctor said that [in the time it took to] prepare me for the cesarean section they could do three natural births.It was like they were wasting their time. I insisted and insisted and they told me that I had to go back to family planning and get an IUD [intrauterine device]. But I didn't want an IUD.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an unplanned pregnancy while taking hormonal contraception, a birth, and another unplanned pregnancy, Redondo was attempting to gather the paperwork to have a tubal ligation at another public hospital, \"J.B. Iturraspe,\" when we spoke to her in September 2004.She described an onerous process where the ultimate outcome-notwithstanding endless paperwork and consultations-depended on her own ability to convince the individual doctor who was to carry out the operation:\n",
      "\n",
      "Now I have done all the paperwork at another hospital.I have to go there again for them to give me the papers. The social worker told me that I have to insist and insist, because there are doctors who don't want to do it. At first we went to talk to the director [of the hospital] then my husband had to sign, and I had to take this [his signature] to the lawyer. Then to family planning.To get an appointment you have to go early in the morning. I talked to the head [of family planning], and he gave me a piece of paper to go to the social worker. She met with a group of us [women who wanted a tubal ligation], and she told us that we have to negotiate with the doctors, and she gave us an appointment for the gynecologist.He asked me questions, and they give you a piece of paper that the husband has to sign along with two witnesses.Now I need to go ask for the form that says that they can do it, and then I have to go get an appointment so that they can put in my papers that they are allowed to do the tubal ligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marianela Casillas, thirty-seven and mother of six, explained to Human Rights Watch that she also was denied a tubal ligation at the local public hospital \"Dr. Jos Mara Cullen\" in Santa FeCity during her sixth pregnancy, against the recommendation of her gynecologist: \"I shouldn't become pregnant anymore because I have hypertension. Also I get very high blood pressure from the contraceptive pills. My organism rejects the IUD [intrauterine device], and then there is no other method. I want to get my tubes tied. The gynecologist prescribed it herself, that they should do it at the same time [when I gave birth]. But they didn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Several women told Human Rights Watch that doctors second-guessed their wishes, denying them access to tubal ligation on the reasoning that the women might change their minds later.\"What they say is that if you do it while you are very young, you might change your mind and they would have to reverse it.It is like they are in favor of you having more children,\" noted Yanina Carlotto, forty-six.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 20 percent of women sterilized at a young age later regret this decision.The WHO, however, does not advise the delay of tubal ligation for young women who are otherwise medically eligible, but rather cautions that all women should be properly counseled about the permanency of sterilization and the availability of alternative contraceptive methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Human Rights Watch's interviews show that women face questioning about their potential future husbands or partners even at a quite advanced reproductive age.\"The doctor asked me if I was going to separate and get together with someone else,\" recalled Marina Padilla, forty-one, who was thirty-nine when she asked for a tubal ligation during her seventh pregnancy at public hospital \"J.B. Iturraspe\" in Sante Fe City.Marcela Espinosa, thirty-two, captured the sentiments of many of the women Human Rights Watch interviewed when she said: \"If I don't want any more [children], and if I ask for it [a tubal ligation], no one can say to me: 'what happens if you have another husband.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases, women we interviewed managed to convince a doctor in the public health care system to provide access to a tubal ligation as a personal \"favor.\"Andrea Gonzlez, forty-six, had asked for a tubal ligation after the birth of her third child, but the doctor had denied her the operation at the public hospital \"Maternidad Nuestra Seora de las Mercedes\" in San Miguel de Tucumn.After the birth of her seventh child, another doctor told Gonzlez that she would \"help her.\"\"She put on the gloves, she didn't tell me anything.I suppose she did something. I haven't gotten pregnant again,\" Gonzlez recalled.Although Gonzlez was ultimately fortunate enough to succeed in her pleadings with her doctor, the fact remains that she was not allowed to make an independent decisions about her reproductive health.\n",

      "Economics Trumps Medical Need: Ready Access in Private Health Clinics\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the law on the medical profession applies to both public and private medical practices, it appears to have more force in the public health care system.A legislative aide in Santa FeProvince explained: \"Here you have two options.If you have money, you go to a private institute, and the same doctor who does it there [i.e. performs the tubal ligation] is the one who refuses to do it in the public sphere. In reality, this allows for a discriminatory situation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Marisa Rossi, thirty-six, who worked as a nurse in the private health system for several years, confirmed that women had access to tubal ligation upon demand if they could pay for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to do it, they will do it.You decide. Because in the private system you decide anything you want to do. They put some kind of pathology that does not exist [in your papers, to cover for the tubal ligation].And even more if you have many children, then they offer it to you, they say: 'Stop torturing yourself!' If you have money, they do anything you want.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that there is economic discrimination at play was not lost on the women who sought and were refused tubal ligations.Laura Passaglia, a thirty-two-year-old woman who had had nine pregnancies, was denied a tubal ligation by a court in Buenos AiresProvince in 2004.She said: \"If you have the money, yes [you can get a tubal ligation], but what about those of us who don't have money? I have neighbors who cannot even afford shoes.\"Nora Casas, thirty-four, echoed this sentiment: \"If you have the money, the doctor does it for you. If you have the money you can do it at any age.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, many women Human Rights Watch interviewed cited financial constraints as their main reason for wanting the operation in the first place.\"I would like to do it, because I am forty years old, I have seven children, and the economic situation is not good,\" said Marina Padilla. \"I told the doctor: 'The economic situation is worse all the time, and they just fired my husband.It is all the time more and more difficult.And there are so many of them now [my children].'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Requiring Judicial Authorization\n",
      "\n",
      "Argentina's law does not specifically require judicial authorization for tubal ligation.However, many doctors, government officials, NGO representatives, and individual women believed this to be a requirement, either legally or de facto, or saw the legal provisions as ambiguous enough that they felt compelled to seek authorization to avoid legal action.\"[N]o one has ever done a tubal ligation without judicial authorization,\" noted Ins Martnez, responsible for the coordination of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation.\"Those [doctors] who might otherwise do it [perform a tubal ligation] are afraid to go to jail,\" explained Paola Bergallo, a university professor with expertise in reproductive health law.That said, to Human Rights Watch's knowledge, no doctor had had his or her license revoked or been sent to prison for performing a tubal ligation.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Human Rights Watch interviewed women who did have a voluntary tubal ligation without judicial authorization, we also encountered women who had to go to court to ask for a judicial authorization for their operation, sometimes only to be denied authorization, or to give birth before their motion was considered or appealed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gisela Oporto, thirty-seven, told Human Rights Watch that she sought judicial authorization for a tubal ligation during her last pregnancy due to severe pregnancy-related health problems, but she gave birth before the case was finally resolved.As a result, she never had the operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oporto started suffering from hypertension during her first unplanned pregnancy, and her doctors at public hospital \"Gobernador Domingo Mercante\" in Buenos AiresProvince advised against using contraceptive pills: \"They [the doctors] didn't want to give me the pills.They told me to use condoms, but my husband says that [then] he doesn't feel anything.\"Oporto had two other unplanned pregnancies, then tried to use contraceptive pills again to avoid another health-threatening pregnancy:\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was pregnant with the third child, I got very depressed. I was really ill, I almost died with the last pregnancy. ... I started to throw up and the scar [from previous cesarean sections] started to bleed, and I couldn't breathe. After I had her, the doctor gave me pills, but they changed my nerves. I was menstruating three or four times a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oporto decided to stop taking the contraceptive pills.After six years, Oporto got pregnant again, unplanned.\n",
      "\n",
      "[The birth] had to be by cesarean section, so I decided to have a tubal ligation. ... We were trying to find out how.You have to have money.In the private clinic, the price depends, something between 600 and 800 pesos [U.S.$202-269.36], plus the days you are there. [It comes to up to] 2,500 pesos [U.S.$841.75]. ... I also checked it out at the public hospital.... The doctor said that without authorization from the judge, she wouldn't do it.\n",

      "This doctor, she gave me a note that said my life would run risk [with another pregnancy] and also supposedly the life of the baby. ... Another doctor said the same thing. ... [The court] asked for the birth certificates of my children, and for a psychological analysis ... [and] a summary of my clinical history. ... I asked the social worker for help with all of this. ... The judge denied the motion, and the baby was almost ready to be born. ... The [scheduled] birth [by cesarean section] was set earlier [than expected] , and we had to appeal to the Supreme Court [of the Province]. ... [Finally] they couldn't do it [the tubal ligation], because she was already born.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court held that there were no \"serious\" reasons for Oporto to require a tubal ligation, and moreover that she had not proven that it would be impossible for her to use other types of contraception that did not require sterilization.However, neither the court nor the doctors at the local public hospital specified what those methods might be: \"No one at the hospital has given me any information about contraception. ... If I go to the gynecologist and I ask for pills or an injection, she says that she cannot [give them to me] because of my high blood pressure.As for the IUD [intrauterine device], because I am fat, they are afraid that the IUD will fall out.\" Oporto concluded: \"They should make it easier for women who decide to have a tubal ligation, especially when their lives are in danger.\"\n",

      "Laura Passaglia, thirty-two, had a similar experience, also in Buenos AiresProvince.When Human Rights Watch interviewed Passaglia, she had had nine pregnancies, including two miscarriages and a premature child that died soon after birth.She tried to get a tubal ligation for the first time when she plunged into deep depression after that child died: \"The fourth child was the baby that died. I was in a state, I didn't want anything, neither the children that I already had, nor the ones that might come. I was asking around for a tubal ligation.They said no, that there was no law.That with money, yes, but I would have to take food away from my children to get the 1,000-2,000 pesos [U.S.$336.70-673.40] needed [for the operation].\"Several pregnancies later, Passaglia consulted her doctor at public hospital \"Larcade\" in Buenos AiresProvince about the possibility of having a tubal ligation once more.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked the doctor, and she said no, that there was no law [that allows tubal ligations]. I thought I was going to die, but I wanted to do it, because I thought it was my decision to make. In the hospital, they set up every possible obstacle. The head of the hospital told me that it was the same as having an abortion.At that point I was four months pregnant.\n",

      "Passaglia filed a case for judicial authorization.She told Human Rights Watch that the public hospital kept presenting obstacles that prevented her from complying with the court's demands:\n",
      "\n",
      "I needed to get the summary of my medical history. They gave metwo or three pages [of it].They made me pay, but they didn't give [all of] it to me. They charged me 10 pesos [U.S.$3.37] and I had to wait for a month for them to give it to me. You can't get your medical history just like that. The expert witness said that having many children is not an added health risk or anything.[But] I was having contractions during the whole pregnancy, and I didn't have help at home, I had to keep going.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court that reviewed Passaglia's case admitted that the evidence presented proved that she had high blood pressure and repeated urinary tract infections; that the medicine she received did not help her; and that she was under medical order only to carry out light tasks and not to walk around, but that she was unable to do so because of her other children.The court nevertheless denied Passaglia the tubal ligation based on the testimony of the expert witness chosen by the court, who noted that there was \"no medical reason\" for the operation even though he considered Passaglia's pregnancy-related health problems serious enough to add that Passaglia should seek medical attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all women who have asked for judicial authorization for tubal ligation have been denied the operation.Some courts have ordered hospitals to honor such petitions.However, the fact remains that women's right to access voluntary tubal ligation-a safe, highly effective contraceptive method-depends on spouses, judges, doctors, social workers, and personal finances.\n",

      "\n",
      "An estimated half a million women undergo illegal and therefore generally unsafe abortion every year in Argentina, representing 40 percent of all pregnancies. Some public officials told Human Rights Watch that, in the public health system in their provinces, for every woman giving birth, approximately one other woman is hospitalized with health complications as a consequence of an illegal abortion.Unsafe abortions have constituted the leading cause of maternal mortality in the country for decades.The extraordinarily high proportion of pregnancies ending in abortions bears testimony to women's lack of access to effective family planning information and services.This chapter documents the tragic personal consequences of Argentina's restrictions on women's human rights in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Argentina's penal code stipulates that abortion is a crime in all circumstances, though the penalty may be waived if the life or health of the pregnant woman is in danger or if the pregnancy results from the rape of a mentally disabled woman.In practice, such \"nonpunishable\" abortions are rare because there are no clear policies regulating access.\n",
      "\n",
      "The criminalization of abortion leads women to take desperate measures, such as attempting to abort with knitting needles, rubber tubes, parsley sprigs, or the use of abortive medicines without adequate medical assistance.It also enables clandestine abortion \"clinics\" to operate with little regard for women's health and lives.When women hemorrhaging or suffering from life-threatening infections or injuries caused by botched abortions show up at public hospitals, health care personnel sometimes scorn them and deny them treatment.Doctors performing post-abortion curettage-the highly painful scraping of a woman's uterus with a sharp instrument-sometimes do so without anesthesia.Women who fear criminal proceedings are discouraged from seeking necessary post-abortion care, often to the serious detriment of their health.Some women who have had abortions are sentenced to prison, in a further assault on their human rights.\n",

      "Argentina's penal code declares abortion illegal in all circumstances, though the penalties are suspended in two circumstances: 1) where a doctor decides that the pregnant woman's life or health is in danger and cannot be saved in any other way than by inducing an abortion; and 2) where a mentally disabled and pregnant woman is pregnant as a result of a rape and her guardian or legal representative allows the abortion.[166]However, there are no national regulations to ensure women's access to such non-punishable abortions.In fact, some provincial government officials Human Rights Watch interviewed were not aware that any exceptions existed in the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confusion and fear about the legal consequences of abortion prevent women from accessing what is their right: a nonpunishable abortion when their health or life is in danger, or when the pregnancy is the result of the rape of a mentally disabled woman.\"There is a lot of fear,\" said Juliana Weisburd, coordinator of the National Program on Sexual Health and Responsible Procreation at the Santa FeProvince ministry of health.Weisburd noted that while the penal code does not require judicial authorization for an abortion, judicial authorization had become a de facto requirement because most doctors would not carry out the procedure without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Walter Barbato, a reproductive health expert with years of public health experience, told Human Rights Watch that it is very difficult for women to access nonpunishable abortion: \"It is practically impossible, because the [Penal] Code does not leave you any possibilities, because of the resistance from the doctors, and because they [doctors] are afraid of sanctions.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reproductive health expert, the head of a maternity ward at a public hospital, told Human Rights Watch that he did not believe that judicial authorization was required to carry out abortions, and therefore never sought it.Yet he regularly consulted a judge privately to get an informal go-ahead for abortions, more for his own peace of mind than out of legal necessity.Either way, an additional and arbitrary level of approval is added to a woman's access even to abortions that are not punishable under Argentine law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2000, the U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concern about Argentina's restrictive abortion laws:\"the Committee is concerned that the criminalization of abortion deters medical professionals from providing this procedure without judicial order, even when they are permitted to do so by law, inter alia when there are clear health risks for the mother or when pregnancy results from rape of mentally disabled women.\"The Committee recommended that Argentina remove all obstacles to obtaining abortion procedures where not punishable by law.\n",

      "As with access to contraceptives, the quality and therefore the health consequences of illegal abortions seemed to depend on the economic standing of the women.This situation is not limited to Argentina.The World Health Organization has warned that poor women and those living in isolated areas worldwide are at particular risk for unsafe abortions performed by unskilled providers when abortion services are legally restricted.The U.N. Human Rights Committee has expressed concern about this situation in Argentina specifically, noting its \"concern over discriminatory aspects of the laws and policies in force, which result in disproportionate resort to illegal, unsafe abortions by poor and rural women.\"Notwithstanding the relatively safer services in the more expensive clandestine abortion clinics, the illegal nature of these clinics means that their operations escape government regulation and oversight.Such regulation and oversight are crucial to protect women's health and lives.\n",

      "\n",
      "Introduction of a foreign object into the cervix carries a high risk of infection when the object is not sterile.In physiological terms, the introduction of an object into the cervix generates contractions and sometimes punctures the amniotic sac, which may result in an abortion.However, self-induced abortions are often incomplete, which further heightens the need for life-saving post-abortion care.A guide to abortion methods for medical doctors notes:\n",

      "In the 643-page World Report, its 28th edition, Human Rights Watch reviews human rights practices in more than 90 countries. In his introductory essay, Executive Director Kenneth Roth writes that political leaders willing to stand up for human rights principles showed that it is possible to limit authoritarian populist agendas. When combined with mobilized publics and effective multilateral actors, these leaders demonstrated that the rise of anti-rights governments is not inevitable.\n",

      "After the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, Vietnamese authorities engaged in a renewed crackdown against rights activism, arresting dozens of bloggers and activists and sentencing many to long prison terms. Basic rights including freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement, and religion remain severely restricted in Vietnam’s one-party state. State-sanctioned thugs often attacked dissidents, while police brutality, including deaths in police custody, remains a serious problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "“During the TPP negotiations, Vietnamese authorities knew it looked terrible to arrest activists,” said Brad Adams, Asia director. “But they have dropped their mask since the Trump administration pulled out of the TPP, and started handing out heavy prison sentences to citizens peacefully calling for democracy and an end to one-party rule.”\n",

Blogger Nguyen Van Dai and his colleague Le Thu Ha remain in police custody since December 2015 without trial. The initial charge against them was propaganda against the state. In July 2017, it was changed to subversion.\n",

      "The Communist Party of Vietnam presides over a one-party state that severely limits basic freedoms and punishes dissent. At least 119 people are currently serving lengthy prison terms for expressing critical views of the government, taking part in peaceful protests, participating in religious groups disapproved of by the authorities, or joining civil or political organizations that the ruling party deems to be threats to its monopoly on power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vietnam bans independent political parties, labor unions, and human rights organizations. Religious groups can only operate under government management. The police use various means to repress religious groups that operate outside of official, government-registered, and government-controlled religious institutions, including constant surveillance, intimidation, harassment, forced denunciation, public criticism, and sometimes excessive force.\n",

      "Rights bloggers and activists are subject to constant harassment, intrusive surveillance, detention, bullying interrogation, and the application of pressure on employers, landlords, and family members. Police place them under extrajudicial house arrest or in brief detention so they cannot participate in public events such as pro-environment protests, human rights discussions, or meetings with foreign diplomats, or attend trials of fellow activists. The authorities also prohibit rights activists and bloggers from traveling abroad, sometimes citing vague national security reasons. In June, Vietnam stripped former political prisoner Pham Minh Hoang of his Vietnamese citizenship and deported him to France.\n",

      "Physical assaults against rights bloggers and campaigners occur frequently.

      "US Secretary of State John Kerry set out in considerable detail on Friday the evidence for why the United States believes Syrian government forces were responsible for this month’s horrific chemical-weapon attacks on rebel-held portions of the Damascus suburbs. But he gave less detail about the reasons for the military response that by all accounts seems imminent. President Obama did not elaborate in remarks delivered a short time later.\n",
      "\n",
      "The gist of Kerry’s rationale for military action is that Syria seems to have breached an important and long-established international norm against the use of chemical weapons. These weapons indeed are despicable, as made vivid by the ghastly videos and photos of their dead and dying victims. Stopping any further use is a laudable aim. And drawing the line on chemical weapons will help to deter the use of other weapons of mass destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it is unclear how the US government plans to proceed beyond the military action that both Obama and Kerry have said would be limited. Kerry talked about holding President Bashar al-Assad “accountable”—a term more appropriate for the International Criminal Court (which the United States studiously avoids mentioning in the Syrian context) than military action. Others have talked about punishing Assad—a dubious goal given his demonstrated willingness to accept all manner of cruelty toward his people and the rapid destruction of his state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the norm against using chemical weapons is not the only international standard at stake. There is also international law prohibiting deliberately and indiscriminately killing civilians, which the Syrian government has flouted on a much larger scale. Against the 1,429 people whom Kerry said were killed by the chemical attack outside Damascus are the tens of thousands of civilians whom Syrian troops and militia have killed in two-and-a-half years of war. Armed opposition groups have also committed their share of indiscriminate shelling and serious abuses against suspected government supporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Upholding the norm that civilians should never be gassed is important. So is upholding the law against this broader killing of civilians—which Obama previously described as “a core national security interest.” As the United States prepares to lead a military attack in Syria, the campaign will be measured by its consequences. Will it enhance protection for all Syrian civilians, regardless of how they are attacked? Or does the United States have other plans for doing that? Neither Obama nor Kerry has said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kerry was eloquent when he said: “History would judge us all extraordinarily harshly if we turned a blind eye to a dictator’s wanton use of weapons of mass destruction against all warnings, against all common understanding of decency.” Reinforcing the “red line” against chemical attacks is certainly important. But if the effect is to retain a “green light” for Assad’s massive slaughter of civilians by other means, it will be a hollow victory. A military response may not be the answer, but what is the plan for these other victims? That’s a question that should be answered—by not only the United States but also Russia, the Arab League, and the many others who are doing so little to help. For the countless civilians whose lives are still in jeopardy from conventional weapons, will it be more of turning a blind eye?\n",

They have also been charged with treason, for which the authorities have said they will be tried later.Elchin Gambarov, a lawyer for Leyla Yunus, told Human Rights Watch that medical workers administered injections to Arif Yunus before and during the hearings on August 4 and 5, but that Yunus, who walks with difficulty, could barely sit up and spent the trial lying in his wife’s lap in the glass-enclosed defendants’ cage.During a preliminary hearing on July 15, Leyla Yunus also told reporters that her husband has a walnut-size visible lump on his head that has not been diagnosed or properly treated. In the past 18 months, Arif Yunus has been diagnosed with a heart condition and has suffered two strokes.The trial, which began on July 27, is already in its final stages, with the prosecution’s closing statement expected on August 6. The defense requested 10 days to prepare its closing, and the judge is expected to rule on that request soon. Authorities have prevented nearly all independent journalists and observers from attending the trial. A handful of diplomats have been allowed to observe.Authorities arrested Leyla Yunus on July 30, 2014, and have kept her in custody since then, despite her serious health problems and her credible allegations that she has faced harassment and ill-treatment in detention. She suffers from severe diabetes and Hepatitis C and requires regular treatment, including a special diet. Gamborov, her lawyer, reported on July 31 that she was suffering from abdominal pain, spasms, and vomiting but did not receive appropriate medical care.Authorities charged Arif Yunus together with his wife on July 30, 2014, but released him under police supervision because of his poor health. Police took him into custody on August 5, 2014, while he was on his way to deliver food and medicine to his wife in detention, for allegedly violating the terms of his house arrest, including by giving media interviews and meeting with someone who was under criminal investigation.The arrest and trial of the couple are part of Azerbaijan’s fierce campaign of arrests, imprisonment, and intimidation against human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers, and opposition political activists.In April 2015, Azerbaijan courts convicted two other human rights defenders, Intigam Aliyev and Rasul Jafarov , and sentenced them to seven-and-a-half years and six-and-half years of prison, respectively. On appeal, Jafarov’s sentence was reduced by three months.Preliminary hearings against an investigative journalist, Khadija Ismayilova, also accused of economic crimes and of driving a person to attempt suicide, began in late July, and the trial is expected to recommence on August 7.“Leyla and Arif Yunus need medical care, not prison,” Williamson said. “Azerbaijan’s international partners should flatly and unanimously condemn this mockery of justice.”\n",

      "This week, justice came to Chad. On Thursday, a Belgian judge, acting under the authority of his country's controversial, and since repealed, long-arm anti-atrocity statute, indicted Hissène Habré, the exiled ex-dictator who brutalized the impoverished African country from 1982 to 1990, on charges of torture and crimes against humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice came because of Souleymane Guengueng, a modest civil servant who watched hundreds of cell-mates perish from torture and disease during two years in Habré's prisons. Guengueng took an oath before God that if he ever got out of jail alive, he would bring his tormenters to justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Habré was finally chased out by his former chief of staff, Idriss Déby, in 1990 and fled to Senegal — where he lived safely in a seaside villa enjoying the $14 million he reportedly looted from the treasury as he fled — Guengueng, a walking skeleton, used his considerable charm to persuade hundreds of still-frightened victims to form a group to prepare a case against Habré. Déby's new government soon brought on many of Habré's henchmen, however, and gave up on seeking his extradition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ten years later, inspired by the London arrest of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, Guengueng and his colleagues traveled to Senegal with the help of international rights groups to ask the courts there to arrest Habré. Even they were surprised when a bold young Senegalese judge listened to their testimony and indicted Habré on torture charges and placed him under house arrest.\n",
      "\n",
      "But soon after, the young judge was transferred off the case, and the prosecution was dismissed on the ground that Senegalese courts had no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Chad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guengueng did not give up, however. He and other victims, including several who had taken up exile in Belgium, pressed charges against Habré in that country, whose famous \"universal jurisdiction\" law allowed its courts to hear atrocity cases from all over the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Belgian judge approved the case and went to Chad, where he and a police team visited Habré's former prisons and mass graves together with Guengueng and other ex-detainees. Witnesses lined up to tell their story.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working with Guengueng, I made frequent trips to Chad to build the case against Habré. Once, I stumbled onto the abandoned archives of Habré's personal Gestapo, the feared \"DDS.\" Tens of thousands of documents strewn on the floor, including daily lists of dead prisoners, surveillance reports and arrest records, detailed how Habré had placed the DDS under his direct control, attacked rival ethnic groups and organized the repression of political opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two years ago, the case again looked dead. Under heavy U.S. pressure following charges filed there against U.S. officials, Belgium repealed its ambitious anti-atrocity law. Guengueng and I went to Brussels, however, and won a grandfather clause for the Habré prosecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, 15 years after Habré was deposed, and more than five years after he was first arrested in Senegal, a Belgian judge has indicted the former tyrant and is seeking his extradition. Senegal's president has said he has no objection to turning Habré over. Habré's trial in Belgium would be a wake-up call to dictators in Africa and elsewhere that if they commit similar atrocities, they could also be brought to justice one day.\n",

      "The coup leaders of the self-proclaimed National Committee for the Reestablishment of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDR) said they had overthrown the government because of the inadequate support for the army in its military operations against the rebellion by the separatist Tuareg National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which seeks autonomy for the north they call Azawad. Since the outbreak of fighting, the Malian army has lost several major military bases, most recently the strategic base of Amachach, near Tessalit. On January 24, the rebels overran the Aguelhoc military base, allegedly summarily executing at least 70 Malian soldiers.\n",

Amadou Sanogo,had detained at least two government ministers – the foreign affairs minister,Soumeylou Boubèye Maïga, and the territorial administration and local authorities minister, Kafougouna Koné – as well as several loyalist military officers. There were also reports of looting of the presidential palace, shops, and gas stations in Bamako. As a result of soldiers firing in the air, numerous civilians are reported to have been shot by stray bullets. During a speech on national television, Capt. Sanogo called for calm and denounced all looting.\n",

      "Human Rights Watch is concerned that the unrest provoked by the coup could result in attacks against minority populations, notably the Tuareg and Arab ethnic groups, and called on the coup leaders to ensure that the rights and safety of all Malians are respected. In early February, civilians carried out scores of reprisal attacks against the homes and businesses of Tuaregs in Bamako, Kati, Sikasso, Koulikoro and Gao. The attacks provoked widespread panic and the flight of tens of thousands of Tuaregs from Mali.\n",

      "I write on behalf of Human Rights Watch to urge you to ensure that the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs embraces the need for global drug policies based on human rights principles and addresses the serious human rights harms of current global drug policy through significant reforms of that policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades and in numerous countries, Human Rights Watch has documented abuses that are often inextricably linked to global drug policies that heavily emphasize criminalization of drug use, possession, production and distribution. We believe the 2016 UNGASS offers a unique opportunity to reassess these policies, engage in an open and wide-ranging debate about their harms, and consider alternatives to the current approach to global drug control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifically, we urge you to ensure that the following key human rights concerns are at the heart of the debate:\n",
      "\n",
      "National and international responses to drugs have often involved large-scale abuses and discriminatory practices in the name of enforcing criminal laws or ensuring “treatment” of people who use drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The heavy emphasis on criminalizing the drug trade has dramatically enhanced the profitability of illicit drug markets, fueling the operations of groups that commit abuses, corrupt authorities, and undermine democracy and the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criminalizing personal drug use is itself problematic in terms of human rights, as it tramples on the person’s right to privacy and basic concepts of autonomy underpinning all rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drug policies often compound harms to the health of people who use drugs by driving them away or denying them essential health services and information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Restrictive drug policies impede medical and scientific use of controlled substances in numerous countries, condemning millions to needless suffering from pain and other symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "While this is not a comprehensive list of all the human rights concerns raised by existing global drug policies, we believe it encompasses many of the central issues that the 2016 special session should tackle directly. We provide additional detail on each of these issues in an annex to this letter. We urge you to make each of them an explicit item on the agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "For additional information about Human Rights Watch’s position on drug policy reform, we urge you to review our essay, “The Human Rights Case for Drug Reform,” which we attach for your reference. In addition, we attach a list of our many publications dealing with various human rights issues related to drug control policies, which we encourage you or your team to consult as you work on the agenda for the session.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you in advance for your consideration of these suggestions. We look forward to discussing our concerns further in coming months.\n",

Beyani, who was investigating the plight of hundreds of internally displaced members of the Lumad ethnic minority group, castigated the AFP for attributing to him an assessment of the situation that was “incorrect, unacceptable, and … a gross distortion of my views.” He was in the Philippines from July 21 to July 31 at the invitation of the government.\n",

      "\n",
      "This illustrates the yawning gap between the AFP’s rhetoric on respect for human rights and the far more abusive reality. The AFP has a well-documented track record of trying to create the illusion of being a rights-respecting entity while ignoring serious rights abuses within its ranks. Those efforts, which include the operations of the AFP’s Human Rights Office, paint a veneer of proactive concern about rights abuses to hide the military abuses that local activists – and UN officials like Beyani – routinely expose.\n",
      "\n",
      "A spokesman for the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command has apologized and resigned over the Beyani statement fiasco. But the AFP owe Beyani and the Philippine people accountability, not just an apology. This episode highlights the urgent need for AFP chief Gen. Hernando Iriberri to address the rot within its ranks and get serious about tackling human rights abuses. One important place to look would be a thorough and transparent inquiry into the role played by the military and paramilitary groups in the displacement of Filipinos, particularly vulnerable ethnic minority groups, in conflict zones in Mindanao.\n",

Shortly before he left office in January 2017, President Obama signed an executive order to temporarily lift economic sanctions and give Sudan six months to make “progress” in five key areas before lifting them permanently.

      "The government has extended a unilateral ceasefire and reduced indiscriminate bombing and shelling of civilian areas, but its armed forces still use scorched-earth tactics and in May burned seven villages in North Darfur and killed at least 10 civilians. And while Sudan nominally relaxed restrictions on aid groups, it still blocks their access to conflict-affected areas, restricts peacekeepers’ movements, and has yet to agree on how to get critical humanitarian aid to civilians in rebel-held Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile.\n",

      "Meanwhile, authorities continue to detain human rights activists like Dr. Mudawi on trumped-up charges that carry the death penalty, violently break up student protests, and shut down events and local organizations. Authorities have also continued with threats to kick out South Sudanese refugees. In December, a British journalist and his American-Sudanese translator, who entered Darfur to investigate Amnesty International’s report that Sudanese security forces used chemical weapons against civilians in Jebel Marra, were detained for nearly two months and severely tortured with beatings, electric shocks, and mock executions.\n",

      "(Bangkok) – The government of Bangladesh is blocking aid groups from providing any meaningful education to Rohingya children in refugee camps and banning the children from attending schools outside the camps, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The government should urgently lift the restrictions that unlawfully deprive almost 400,000 Rohingya refugee children of their right to education.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 81-page report, “‘Are We Not Human?’: Denial of Education for Rohingya Refugee Children in Bangladesh,” documents how Bangladesh prohibits aid groups in the refugee camps in the Cox’s Bazar district from providing Rohingya children with accredited or formal education. There is no secondary-level education, and groups are barred from teaching the Bengali language and using the Bangladesh curriculum. Rohingya children have no opportunity to enroll in or continue their education at private or public schools outside the refugee camps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bangladesh has made it clear that it doesn’t want the Rohingya to remain indefinitely, but depriving children of education just compounds the harm to the children and won’t resolve the refugees’ plight any faster,” said Bill Van Esveld, associate children’s rights director at Human Rights Watch. “The government of Bangladesh saved countless lives by opening its borders and providing refuge to the Rohingya, but it needs to end its misguided policy of blocking education for Rohingya children.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch interviewed 163 Rohingya children, parents, and teachers, as well as government officials and staff at humanitarian groups and United Nations agencies. Human Rights Watch also analyzed government policy documents and aid plans, and researched how aid groups have tried to deliver education programs for children in the camps while working within the government’s restrictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rohingya refugee children have been watching their chance for an education and a better future evaporate, and two years on there is still not even a plan to enroll them in schools. Bill Van Esveld Human Rights Watch\n",
      "\n",
      "Bangladesh has provided refuge to generations of ethnic Rohingya who fled previous waves of persecution in Myanmar but has never allowed Rohingya children to access to formal, accredited education. After Bangladesh opened its borders to an additional 740,000 Rohingya fleeing the Myanmar military’s deadly campaign of ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity that started on August 25, 2017, the government prohibited aid groups from using even an existing, informal version of the Bangladesh curriculum in the camps. It claims that the Rohingya will return “within two years” to Myanmar.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, and other UN agencies have repeatedly stated, though, that conditions in Myanmar are currently not conducive for safe, voluntary, and dignified returns of Rohingya. No refugees have been willing to return despite two repatriation exercises organized by Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myanmar also refused to approve the use of its curriculum in the camps, so UNICEF, the UN children’s agency, developed an informal education program from scratch. The program, submitted for government approval in April 2018, was designed to avoid the Bangladesh government’s ban on formal education, but Dhaka took a year to approve the first two “levels,” equivalent to preschool and the beginning of primary school. The government has still not approved the informal program’s upper three levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "The informal program is a substantial improvement over the lack of any structured learning, but falls far short of meeting Bangladesh’s obligation to ensure Rohingya children have access to quality education without discrimination, Human Rights Watch said. The program is not accredited, nor does it recognize children’s previous education in Myanmar. Even if the government fully approves all five levels of the informal program, children will still not be able to take national examinations or continue their education through secondary school.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Myanmar, the government continues to deny nationality to Rohingya, and worsening restrictions on Rohingya’s freedom of movement have also blocked children from attending school there, particularly since 2012. Myanmar is obliged to ensure the safe, voluntary, and dignified return of the refugees, and should take steps toward ensuring their citizenship rights and holding those responsible for countless serious violations to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Persisting with the ban on formal education is harmful to Bangladesh’s own interests and devastates a new generation of Rohingya children, and the future of the Rohingya community as a whole, Human Rights Watch said. Children deprived of education are at increased risk of child labor and child marriage, of being trapped in poverty, and of being unable to fully participate in their societies. Refugee children who receive an education are less likely to fall under the influence of criminals or armed groups, and are able to contribute to the welfare of their host communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with international standards, refugees should participate in planning, implementing, and monitoring education programs. Aid groups that work in education should work more closely with Rohingya refugees, including former teachers who have established unofficial schools in the camps that teach the Myanmar curriculum. These schools are the only option for children who attended school in Myanmar to continue their studies especially at the secondary level. But because they lack Bangladesh’s approval, they receive no international support. Rohingya refugees said the lack of quality education in the camps had also contributed to the growth of Islamic religious schools, but they usually only provide basic religious instruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myanmar should immediately approve and support the use of its curriculum in the camps, and Bangladesh should allow aid groups to provide quality education, including using formal Bangladesh and Myanmar curricula.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to Bangladesh’s obligations to ensure the right to education for all children under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights treaties, the 2018 Global Refugee Compact, which Bangladesh endorsed, calls for the integration of refugee children into national education systems. Foreign governments and UN agencies that joined the Compact also pledged that refugee children should have access to quality education within three months of being displaced, but have applied almost no public pressure on Bangladesh to lift unlawful restrictions on Rohingya children’s education.\n",
      "\n",
      "International donors should continue to fund school refurbishments in host communities and support education for Bangladeshi children in the Cox’s Bazar district, which has the worst student-teacher ratios and out-of-school rates in the country. Donors should ensure adequate resources are available for both Bangladeshi and Rohingya children in the district and press Bangladesh to respect the rights of all children, including refugees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN-coordinated humanitarian plans for the Rohingya in Bangladesh should include clear benchmarks to fulfill the right to education without discrimination, and donors and humanitarian groups should set timelines for Rohingya children’s access to formal, certified education. Donors should provide transparent, multi-year support to ensure education for Rohingya and host community children. As of October 2019, 60 percent of $59.5 million in humanitarian funding requirements for education for 2019 were still unmet.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Rohingya refugee children have been watching their chance for an education and a better future evaporate, and two years on there is still not even a plan to enroll them in schools,” Van Esveld said. “Depriving an entire generation of children of education is in no one’s interest, and the international community needs to act and demand that Bangladesh and Myanmar change course.”\n",

      "Those have not been empty threats.

      "The Shia Muslim community in Sampang regency, East Java, knows firsthand both the depredation of violent extremists and official apathy in confronting them. On Aug. 20, 2012, hundreds of Sunni militants attacked the community, torching some 50 homes, killing one man and seriously injuring another. The local police, warned ahead of time of the impending violence, stood by at the scene of the attack and declined to intervene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such government indifference to the plight of religious minorities targeted by groups like the FPI or intolerant neighbors is a growing concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "In several incidents we investigated, local officials and security forces facilitated harassment and intimidation of religious minorities — in some cases even blaming the victims for the violent attacks. Officials have made discriminatory statements, refused to issue building permits for houses of worship even when all relevant regulations were complied with, and pressured minority congregations to relocate. In two cases, local officials have refused to implement Supreme Court decisions granting minority groups the right to build houses of worship.\n",

      "Indonesian government institutions in some instances have exacerbated religious intolerance, in direct contravention of the guarantee in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Indonesia ratified in 2005, that “persons belonging to [...] minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Religious Affairs Ministry, the Coordinating Board for Monitoring Mystical Beliefs in Society (Bakor Pakem) under the Attorney General’s Office, and the semi-official Indonesian Ulema Council, have eroded religious freedom by issuing decrees and fatwas (edicts) against members of religious minorities and using their position of authority to press for the prosecution of “blasphemers”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Official responsibility for the state failure to adequately confront rising extremism goes to the very top of Indonesia’s government. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s response to rising incidents of religious intolerance and related violence has been empty rhetoric rather than decisive action in support of besieged religious minorities and the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even worse, Yudhoyono has turned a blind eye to members of his government who have explicitly encouraged abuses, including Religious Affairs Minister Suryadharma Ali, whose hostile comments about the Shia and the Ahmadiyah have included a speech he made at a March 2011 political convention exhorting the government to “ban Ahmadiyah”and comments in September 2012 suggesting mass conversion of Shia to Sunni Islam as the solution to anti-Shia sentiment and violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police appear to have taken their cue from those poor examples. Police have on some occasions sided with Islamist militants at the expense of the rights of religious minorities, ostensibly to avoid violence. Rather than investigating and arresting groups and individuals implicated in threats or physical attacks on religious minorities, police have sometimes opted to persuade the victims of such attacks to leave the area or close their houses of worship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shamefully, police have in some cases colluded with the attackers for religious, economic, or political reasons. In other instances, they choose a course of inaction due to a lack of clear directives from above or concerns that militants outnumber the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the board, the absence of effective police action reflects an institutional failure to hold perpetrators of violent crimes to account and uphold the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of leadership by President Yudhoyono to stand down religious militants and defend religious freedom and tolerance is serving only to ensure that religious minorities continue to face harassment, intimidation and physical attack by vigilante thugs espousing a creed at violent odds with Indonesian law.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the targets today are mostly members of relatively small, politically weak minority groups, the situation could well multiply if the violence and harassment are not nipped in the bud. Intolerance has a way of spreading, and a few years down the road one could see competing groups within the Sunni majority in Indonesia trying to impose their will on co-religionists through intimidation and violence rather than persuasion.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is needed is swift and decisive action by President Yudhoyono beginning with a clear message to police and prosecutors that alleged perpetrators of violence against religious minorities must face investigation and prosecution. Such “zero tolerance” for violence should be put into effect immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch believes the president should also make clear that all government officials, including members of his own cabinet, who make discriminatory comments or condone or encourage harassment of religious minorities will face immediate consequences, up to and including dismissal.\n",

      "I. SUMMARY\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the end of thirty years of military dictatorship and the election, nearly three years ago, of the country's first civilian president in three decades, the Republic of Korea is a more open country with a government that pledges respect for international human rights. Nevertheless, the government of South Korea has not lived up to its pledges. Key laws that suppressed human rights in the country during the decades of military rule have not been changed, and President Kim Young-sam has used them against political opponents and labor activists.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is still legal in South Korea for the security forces to carry out arbitrary arrests and detentions, and for the government to suppress free association, expression and assembly, for workers and other dissidents. Provisions of South Korea's labor laws, the Trade Union Law, the Labor Dispute Adjustment Act, and the Public Servants Act, suppress basic labor rights. These include the internationally guaranteed protections for freedom of association, freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, as well as the right to engage in collective bargaining and peaceful collective action. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has called on the Korean government to amend the National Security Law.1 The country's repressive labor law provisions have been condemned by the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations' Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.2 As South Korea applies to become a member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), we believe that OECD member states must press the Republic of Korea to bring its labor legislation into conformity with international standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "This report focuses on labor rights violations in the Republic of Korea during the last eighteen months. Human Rights Watch/Asia conducted its investigation in June 1995 just prior to the country's important local and provincial elections held on June 27, 1995, when President Kim's government sought to quell labor activity through excessive force and persecution of widely supported labor leaders. The report discusses the legal regime that is used to justify continuing violations of labor rights and examines four case studies of labor disputes involving railway and subway workers, Hyundai Motor employees, Korea Telecom workers, and the Korean Teachers and Educational Workers Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "After crushing the June 1994 railway workers' strikes using mass arrests, President Kim issued provocative statements in May 1995 to inflame an already tense situation and then cracked down on auto and telecommunications workers just prior to the June 27 elections. In response to May's wildcat strike by Hyundai Motor workers, he sent in the police to conduct a raid in Ulsan; in June, he ordered the arrests of workers involved in collective bargaining with Korea Telecom. In addition, his government has continued to harass teacher activists associated with an \"illegal\" teachers' union. These violations take on greater urgency in the face of the scheduled launching on November 11, 1995 of a new national center of independent trade unions. The attempt to establish this autonomous union confederation, with between 400,000 and 500,000 members, will be a decisive test of the South Korean government's respect for labor rights in the \"new Korea.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "III. BACKGROUND\n",
      "\n",
      "Positive Changes\n",
      "\n",
      "When President Kim Young-sam took office in February 1993, he promised a \"new Korea\" that would be \"a freer and more mature democratic society,\"5 and in the early months of his administration there was some genuine progress in improving respect for human rights. A presidential amnesty on March 9, 1993 led to the release of 144 people, at least eighty of whom were political prisoners. Two subsequent amnesties resulted in further releases, and by June 1994 the government had released a total of 226 political prisoners.6\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 1995, to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of liberation from Japanese rule, the Korean government granted amnesty to a total of 1,780 prisoners, including twenty-five political prisoners (approximately 465 political prisoners remain incarcerated).7 Those released included Kim Sun-myung, one of the world's longest-serving political prisoners, who had spent forty-three years and ten months incarcerated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to prisoner releases, President Kim ushered in significant reforms of the country's electoral and finance laws that have succeeded in making the political system more transparent.8 As a result of these initiatives, senior military officers were purged for corrupt practices, while bank accounts-the source of much past corruption-were required to have actual individual names (not aliases) and campaign activities were subjected to closer scrutiny.9 The Korean public welcomed the changes; Kim's approval rating ran as high as 90 percent for the first few months of his tenure, strengthening his popular base. As the government failed to meet expectations of deeper reform, however, publicopinion shifted. In addition, a series of industrial, construction and transportation accidents raised questions about the high social cost of Korea's rapid economic development. President Kim's popularity was reported to be at an all-time low in May 1995.10 As evidence of the country's increasingly vibrant and open political culture, in the hard-fought June 1995 election campaign for some 5,550 local and provincial offices, the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) suffered a clear setback. Opposition and independent candidates won all but five of the fifteen mayoralties and governorships at stake.11 The opposition Democratic Party (DP) candidate won the Seoul mayoral contest depriving the DLP of the country's largest metropolitan administration. In part, this was believed to be dissatisfaction with the incomplete nature of President Kim's reform program.12\n",
      "\n",
      "Until the government of South Korea embarked on political reforms in June 1987, the official program to promote economic growth had, over twenty years, depended on maintaining tight restrictions on the labor movement.13 From the time of Gen. Park Chung-hee (1961-1979), Korea's military rulers regarded unions as inherently left-wing institutions; thus, the restrictions were also aimed at keeping workers from being exposed to \"communist\" ideas, to protect national security. Some of the largest corporations in the country, such as the Hyundai conglomerate, allowed no unions at all, and the government openly intervened to break strikes throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. In the clashes that ensued both sides used violence. While the use of force by police in controlling demonstrations may have been justified in some cases, the government used a range of techniques to curb the labor movement which violated fundamental human rights, including severe physical abuse of workers in detention and repeated and grossly excessive use of force to break up workers' rallies and strikes. Compared with his predecessors, President Kim's government does represent some real improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Economic Growth and the Effort to Stall Progress on Labor Rights\n",
      "\n",
      "As one of Asia's most economically successful conutries, Korea's production has expanded dramatically in the last two decades, and Seoul is extremely eager to play a greater role on the world's economic stage. In 1994, GDP grew at a rate of 8.4 percent, and in the first quarter of 1995 it reached 9.9 percent growth. Korea is now the world's eleventh-ranking economic power and the thirteenth-largest trading nation, with total trade reaching $198.4 billion in 1994.14 In 1995 the figure is expected to top $220 billion, and per capita income in South Korea is expected to reach $10,000. Korean companies are rapidly moving to establish manufacturing bases in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Central America.15 Korea is among the leading countries in several global industries, including auto, telecommunications and aerospace.16 Based on its dazzling economic performance, in March 1995 the Republic of Korea applied for admission to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the club of industrialized democracies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Linked with this rising international economic stature, Kim Young-sam has made the policy of \"globalization\" the centerpiece of his presidency. According to Kim, \"globalization is the quickest way to build the republic into a first-rate nation in the coming century. The administration is now concentrating all its energies on this task.\"17 The impetus driving \"globalization\" is largely external. In order to meet the World Trade Organization's standards and join the OECD, Korea must open and liberalize its economy.18 While the specific meaning of \"globalization\" remains vague, the government's actions in the name of this policy have led to a dizzying speed-up in production and privatization.. To enable Korean capital to expand abroad and remain competitive as the domestic market opens to goods produced in the international economy, President Kim's program has pressed for greater efficiency, and this has led to worsening labor conditions, including repression of independent unions, greater production quotas for workers, increased industrial accidents, broader implementation of \"flex time\" regimes that reduce overtime payments and longer work days.19 Discerning the labor movement's unhappiness with these conditions, the government's numerous research institutes, some staffed by American-trained Ph.D. of \"the Chicago school,\" have studied the experience of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in breaking the power of the miners' union and air traffic controllers in their respective countries.20 The government has justified suppressing independent labor activists by invoking the need to expand Korea's economy in today's international market. This has led, however, to an increase in labor unrest. In the first five months of 1995, the export losses resulting from production stoppages jumped 115-fold compared with the same period the year before: $95 million in 1995, compared to $814,000 in 1994. At the same time, the number of workers participating in strikes increased from 5,491 to 14,085. The main reason for the huge loss in exports and production was the labor dispute at Hyundai Motor, discussed below.21\n",
      "\n",
      "Reform Stalled\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of \"globalization,\" the government's early commitment to some human rights reform has clearly ebbed; President Kim has cited the need to maintain economic growth as the justification for suppressing labor rights. Unlike countries in other regions where \"truth telling\" played a critical part in the transition from dictatorship to more democratic government, Korea has experienced virtually no accountability for human rights abuse under recent military rule. Nor has there been legal justice for victims of past abuses. On July 18, 1995, for example, the Seoul High Prosecutor's Office dismissed a lawsuit brought against former Presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo and thirty-four others for their role in the infamous 1980 Kwangju Massacre, in which at least 2,000 were killed and thousands more seriously injured.22\n",
      "\n",
      "The limitations of President Kim's \"new Korea\" were all too vividly demonstrated in the streets of Seoul and Ulsan during May and June of 1995. Intensifying labor protests in the auto and telecommunications industries coincided with the first local and provincial elections since 1962, and with the stakes so high on the election outcome, the government repressed the independent labor movement in the automobile and telecommunications industries. A wildcatstrike at Hyundai Motor and subsequent police raid in May, the intense negotiations that followed and the arrest of Korea Telecom union leaders in June dramatizes the dangerously incomplete transition to respect for human rights and the urgent need for further reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. THE LEGAL CONTEXT\n",
      "\n",
      "The Republic of Korea joined the International Labor Organization in 1991, despite the fact that several key Korean laws violate the fundamental principle of the right to freedom of association contained in the ILO Constitution. These include the Trade Union Law, the Labor Dispute Adjustment Act, the Public Servants Act and the Private School Act. The ILO's Governing Body has repeatedly urged Seoul to reform the violative provisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prohibition on Multiple Trade Unions\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trade Union Law provisions on the formation of unions were designed to prevent the establishment of a rival organization to the government-controlled unions or national trade union confederation. Thus, the Trade Union Law prohibits the formation of a union or union federation whose potential \"membership is the same as an already existing trade union.\"23 This provision effectively outlaws any alternative to the company-sponsored unions or the union federations created during the military dictatorship. Thus, by law, Korean workers are limited to joining unions or union federations that are approved by the authorities. The statute denies a worker's right to join the union of his or her choosing and it has resulted in a large sector of South Korea's labor movement lacking any legal status. These requirements contravene provisions of the Korean Constitution which guarantee the right to organize,24 as well as ILO Convention No. 87.25 In practice, worker-initiated trade union organizations have been blocked by employer manipulation of bogus management-created unions that exist only on paper. These unions, however, obtain legal recognition and their existence, by law, prevents the organization of any other unions regardless of worker support . Similarly at the industry level, though trade unions in the automobile and shipbuilding industries formed new federations after 1987, they were unable to obtain legal recognition because of the existence of workers' federations associated with the officially recognized and government-supported Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU).\n",
      "\n",
      "ILO norms have been interpreted to mean that governments may not require prior authorization for union formation and that workers may \"join whatever union they wish.\"26 However, under the Trade Union Law, the establishment of a union is not final until a report has been filed with the local authorities or the Ministry of Labor and a certificate of report has been issued to the union officers. Security force inquiries into the accuracy of the required data have been used to delay or deny recognition of legitimate unions.27 The principal criterion used by the authorities is that the purpose of the union must not be to \"hamper the normal operation of an already existing trade union.\"28\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, there is a sharp difference of views among workers about the union affiliation they prefer. The Trade Union Law's monopoly franchise for FKTU affiliates does not allow dissident workers to form a competing union or otherwise associate with an alternative organization they find preferable. This practice violates the ILO's protections for the right to organize and bargain collectively.29\n",
      "\n",
      "A government that recognizes a single union per industry as the bargaining agent for their workers is not necessarily in violation of an international labor standard, as long as mechanisms exist in the law that allow workers reasonable opportunities to decide, in a democratic election: 1) who among them should be elected leaders of the recognized union; and 2) which association should be recognized by the government as the bargaining agent. If the law establishes a single union and then makes it impossible for workers to challenge the leadership of that union or its official status, the law infringes upon freedom of association and labor rights as recognized in international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trade Union Law, with its restriction on forming unions whose membership may overlap with the \"membership...[of] an already existing trade union,\" prohibits a worker organizing another union at an enterprise where a union already exists and is thus denied the exercise of his right of free association.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FKTU\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trade Union Law was first introduced in 1953 when Park Chung-hee's military government revised the country's labor laws to prevent the establishment of the National Trade Union Council in favor of the FKTU. In 1987, the provision on union formation was amended in response to a strong request from the FKTU to close the remaining loopholes to the emergence of autonomous labor organizations. Although democratic, independent trade unions have been increasing in number and influence since 1987,30 the FKTU remains the sole lawful, national trade union federation. A newly established union has to formally apply for membership in an industrial federation under the FKTU.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Trade Union Law restricts the establishment of new federative workers' associations as well as enterprise level unions, thus favoring the FKTU. Conferring such a monopoly on the leadership prevents workers from exercising their freedom of association. The structural protection for existing associations shields them from risk that the rank and file might desert a coopted leadership. Legal restrictions on the establishment of alternative labor organizations help to entrench the incumbent leadership of the FKTU and national industrial federations.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FKTU comprises twenty industrial federations and fifteen regional offices. Although it claims 1.2 million members, there are only 600,000 dues-paying members.31 The National Convention, which convenes annually, is the supreme body within the FKTU. But most of the important matters are discussed and decided at the Representatives Conference of Industrial Federations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Independent Organizing and the KCTU\n",
      "\n",
      "Pressure from within the labor movement to form more representative unions was therefore strong. The trade unions organized after 1987 created the \"democratic trade union camp,\" setting up regional councils in the major industrial areas. These regional councils founded the Korea Trade Union Congress (KTUC, or Chunnohyup) in January 1990. At its inaugural congress, the KTUC declared its intent to build a national center of independent, industry-wide trade unions. At that time the KTUC represented around 200,000 members from 700 company-affiliated unions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the non-manufacturing sectors, as well, industry-wide federations or councils were established after 1987. Together these formed the Korean Congress of Independent Industrial Trade Union Federation (KCIIF) in May 1990. KCIIF affiliates include the federations of trade unions of employees in industries such as the press, hospitals, construction, clerical and financial sectors, printing, cargo transport, teaching, and foreign corporations. After the Korean Federation of Hospital Workers' Union gained legal status from a High Court and Supreme Court ruling that its organizational subject did not overlap with the existing trade union federation, other federations, formerly without legal standing, gained legal recognition. These included the Korean Federation of Professionals' and Technicians' Union, and the Korean Federation of Construction Workers' Unions.32 In addition to these industry-wide federations, the trade unions of the large conglomerates (the chaebol) like Hyundai, Daewoo, and Kia, formed group trade federations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1993, these two new federations (KTUC and KCIIF), together with the conglomerate-wide unions, formed a larger confederation, the Korean Council of Trade Unions (KCTU, or Chunnodae). In November 1994, the KCTU decided to build a national trade union center and formed a preparatory committee to coordinate the launching of an organization that would rival the size and organizational structure of the FKTU. In 1995, the KCTU had 440,000 members and included 1,000 company-level unions. The new initiatives have also attracted support outside KCTU's formal affiliates. For example, in November 1994, the public service trade unions formed the Council of Public Service Trade Unions (Gongnodae) in order to secure basic trade union rights and oppose the government's wage control policy. Gongnodae's constituent unions come not only from the democratic trade union camp but also from FKTU affiliates and independent unions including the large and influential 53,000 member Korean Telecom Union of telecommunications workers. During 1995 the momentum of independent organization continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the Trade Union Law renders most of these efforts illegal. Some of the human rights consequences of the law on multiple trade unions are illustrated in the Korean Locomotive Council's June 1994 collective action. The Korean Locomotive Council, with a membership of 7,000, had functioned as a de facto union but was not recognized as a lawful trade union because of the existence of the FKTU-affiliated Korean Railway Trade Union. The Korean Locomotive Council's lack of legal recognition \"allowed\" the railway management to refuse to negotiate with the union leadership. Days before a strike deadline, riot police raided the railway workers' peaceful sit-in protest. Hundreds of Locomotive Council members were taken into custody and held for questioning. Twenty-nine activists were formally arrested for participating in an illegal strike action and \"business interference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, the KCTU's planned national center of democratic trade unions, which is scheduled to be launched on November 11, 1995, is, under the law, considered to be a competitor of the FKTU and would therefore be an illegal organization. As a result, two co-presidents of the KCTU face criminal charges (see Korea Telecom section below). On May 8,1995, the Supreme Public Prosecutor issued a \"special order of arrest\" for leaders of the KCTU alleging that the independent and unlawful labor federation was intending to link upcoming collective bargaining over wages with June 27 local and provincial elections.33\n",
      "\n",
      "In South Korea today the independent trade union organizations are allowed to open offices, elect officials and distribute publications. They are not, however, permitted to function as trade union organizations to conduct collective bargaining or labor actions. Thus, while not prohibited as associations, workers are prevented from exercising their basic rights through these organizations. When these organizations function as a trade union group to mobilize support for workers engaged in collective bargaining or strike actions, their leaders are charged with \"third party intervention.\" One independent trade union activist told Human Rights Watch/Asia:\n",
      "\n",
      "Because Korea's Constitution guarantees freedom of association, they can exist as organizations, but because of the provisions of the Trade Union Law, they are non-trade union organizations. When they they act as trade union organizations, they are suppressed.34\n",
      "\n",
      "As the ILO Governing Body noted at its March 1993 session, the Trade Union Law's prohibition on multiple unions denies workers the right to join the organization of their choosing. The ILO called on the Korean government to amend the Trade Union Law to enable workers to establish and join the organization of their choice without restriction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Denial of Freedom of Association for Public Servants\n",
      "\n",
      "The denial of freedom of association to public servants, including school teachers, is another serious infringement of human rights. Public school teachers are classified as educational public servants and under the National Civil Service Act, they are prohibited from organizing, engaging in collective bargaining, and taking collective action.35 The Private School Act extends this prohibition to private school teachers.36\n",
      "\n",
      "The government claims that public officials have a duty to be \"servants of the entire people\" as stated in Article 7 of the constitution. However, Article 7 merely expresses the principle that public officials should not act to benefit only a part of the people, a certain class or political faction, but should always perform their function for the benefit of the whole people. This constitutional mandate has no direct relevance to public officials' labor rights-their right to organize, bargain collectively, or act collectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The South Korean government contends that teachers' unions have no legal basis because teachers are public officials and cannot, in any case, be treated as ordinary workers. However, this position contradicts ILO standards. ILO Convention 151 specifically protects the right of public workers to organize.37 It mandates that public employees' organizations \"shall enjoy complete independence from public authorities.\"38\n",
      "\n",
      "At its March 1993 session, the Governing Body of the ILO concluded that workers, without distinction, should be able to form and join organizations of their own choosing to protect their interests.39 It called on the South Korean government to take the necessary measures to enable public servants and private and public school teachers to exercise freely the right to organize.40 Furthermore, in May 1995, the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights recommended that the South Korean government \"immediately amend its laws and regulations concerning the freedom to form trade unions and the right to strike....In particular, measures should be taken to ensure that teachers, civil servants and others have the right to form trade unions and to take strike action.\"41\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prohibition on \"Third Party Intervention\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Two major Korean labor laws stipulate that \"any person other than a worker who has actual employment relations with the employer or the concerned trade union...shall not engage in an act of interference\" to influence the formation of a trade union42 or instigate a dispute.43 Such \"interference\" has come to be known as \"third party intervention\" and it can include anything from individual advocacy to organized, peaceful displays of solidarity. The ban on \"third party intervention\" has been used to grossly violate the right to free expression in the context of labor disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government bases the prohibition on the supposed need to protect the essential nature of a trade union as an autonomous workers' organization and to prevent radical external forces from influencing a union's activities.The ban has been used to justify criminal prosecution and imprisonment of union leaders for their speeches and statements supporting collective action by other unions.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1993, the ILO decided that the prohibition on \"third party intervention\" violated ILO Convention No. 87, as a \"serious restriction on the free functioning of trade unions\" and strongly recommended that the South Korean government repeal the offending provisions.44 The South Korean government then announced that it was reviewing their repeal. As of October 1995, the government had not submitted a revised bill to the national assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "In an important decision, the United Nations Human Rights Committee considered a case brought by a Korean worker, Sohn Jong-kyu, convicted of \"third party intervention\"; Sohn had issued a statement supporting a shipyard strike and had been sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. In August 1995, the committee found that his imprisonment violated Article 19(2) of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression.45\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Business Interference\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the most commonly used government strike-breaking techniques, in violation of international standards of freedom of association and freedom of assembly, is the practice of charging striking workers under a provision of the Criminal Code prohibiting \"business interference.\"46 The authorities have increasingly relied on this charge. As described below in the case studies, many of the workers at Hyundai and all sixty-four leaders of the Korea Telecom union were charged with violation of \"business interference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Under this provision, a person may be arrested for posing a \"threat of force,\" rather than the actual use of force, while interfering in the business of another. The statute, as applied, violates Korea's obligations under international human rights standards and represents a misuse of the criminal law and process. In Human Rights Watch/Asia's view, for the law to be fairly applied, two criteria must be satisfied: 1) there must be real business going on to be interrupted, and 2) there must be a credible, demonstrated threat of force. Satisfying a high threshold for both criteria is necessary; otherwise there is a real risk of violation of free expression obligations.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a noted authority on Korean labor law, \"business interference\" had been applied by the Korean authorities with no clear distinction between illegal activities and legitimate activities. Normally, interference with business activities is an obvious purpose of collective labor action. The charge has been used to prosecute strikers for aggressive strike activities. For example, in April and May 1990, ten striking workers at the Taehwa Dyeing Company in Taegu were arrested for beating drums outside the plant. All were charged with \"business interference,\" but only one worker was charged with committing physical violence. 47\n",
      "\n",
      "In the cases of the Korea Telecom unionists arrested in June 1995 (see below) the prosecution has argued that \"business interference\" was justified because the union was using aggressive tactics in pursuit of objectives beyond the scope of collective bargaining.48 This represents overreaching by the prosecution to make \"business interference\" apply to conduct arbitrarily deemed appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to another knowledgeable Korean labor lawyer, although the Korean authorities could use provisions of the Labor Dispute Adjustment Act, they do not regard a wildcat strike as a labor dispute but prefer using a Criminal Code offense against militant laborers.49\n",

      "V. CASE STUDIES\n",
      "\n",
      "The June 1994 Railway and Subway Strikes\n",
      "\n",
      "In June 1994, the Korean Locomotive Council (Chongihyup) attempted to initiate collective bargaining with the Korean National Railway (KNR) over working hours, overtime pay and a weekly day off. Because its membership overlapped with employees in the already existing government-approved railway workers federation, under the labor law's prohibition on multiple trade unions, Chongihyup, in violation of the universally guaranteed right to free association, had no legal standing to function as a trade union organization.50 Citing the Council's unlawful status, the government refused to recognize or negotiate with it. A massive police raid on peaceful railway worker protests, resulting in hundreds of arbitrary arrests, was the other half of the government's response-a clear violation of the right to free assembly and of a worker's right to form a union of his or her own choosing. This action provoked a strike and massive dismissals, which in turn crushed Chongihyup.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chongihyup had been established on May 15, 1989, by the locomotive drivers and mechanics employed by the Korean National Railroad. The railway workers had been represented by the FKTU-affiliated and legally recognized 30,000-member Federation of Railroad Workers Union. The drivers and mechanics decided to form their own union, because they believed their interests were not being served by the official union, which they considered to be pro-government. In 1994, Chongihyup's membership had reached 7,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "During 1993 and 1994 working conditions on the railways had deteriorated. Maintenance workers were forced to work a flex time system with twenty-four hours on, twenty-four hours off. They received neither a regular weekly day off nor overtime pay. Since the KNR did not acknowledge many hours as real work hours, on the grounds that they were \"waiting hours,\" and the number of hours worked a day was averaged over the entire month, there were lower overtime payments than if the standard overtime provisions had been applied.51\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 24, 1994, 2,000 railway workers gathered to demonstrate in front of Yongsan railway station in Seoul to demand the abolition of flex time and the reinstatement of four dismissed workers. The government refused even to begin negotiations, finding that the group lacked legal standing. The authorities warned that if Chongihyup took collective action, they would respond with strong measures.52 On June 2, the workers organized a nonviolent protest meeting in downtown Seoul attended by 4,000 railway and subway workers. The next day, the government issued arrest warrants-on charges of \"business interference\"-for twenty Chongihyup members stemming from an event that occurred at the May 26 convention of the legally recognized union, where several Chongihyup members had thrown eggs at the union president.53\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 15, 300 to 400 workers began a sit-in at the KNR office building near Yongsan Train Station in Seoul at the same time railway workers staged similar protests at nineteen Korean National Railway offices around the country. These protests did not interfere with train service. The union members called the sit-in to protest the government's refusal to negotiate, to demand the release of jailed Chongihyup members, and to demand the improvement of working conditions and wages. Chongihyup announced a decision to strike on June 27 if the government refused to negotiate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four days before the June 27 strike date, police arrested 250 workers in Seoul. Similar raids were carried out in Pusan, Masan, and Sunchon. Nearly 600 workers nationwide were detained for questioning.54 These arrests took place with minimal resistance. The workers claimed that their actions had been consistent with state laws and regulations; they had neither refused work nor disrupted normal operations. Most were held for the legal limit of two days for questioning and then released. They were questioned about the organization and its structure. The police demanded that the arrested workers sign a promise to apologize for their actions. Many refused to do so, and those were the last ones released from custody.55\n",
      "\n",
      "The raid provoked a work stoppage on the country's railroads. The police sought arrest warrants for seven leaders of Chongihyup, including Vice Chairman Pak Sang-soo, on charges of abandonment of duty.56 The FKTU and its affiliated railway union urged the workers not to strike and to \"return to the workplace.\" The Korean National Railroad announced its intention to fire the engineers who did not report to work by 10:00 a.m. on June 25.57\n",
      "\n",
      "The Prime Minister called the railway strike illegal since it was staged by public officials who had no right to engage in collective action.58 Korean National Railroad Administrator Choe Hun told the press that he was ready to use one hundred novice railroad engineers and would sack 210.59\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 24, the day after the police raid on the railway workers, subway workers in Seoul went on strike. They were demanding a 14.5 percent pay increase instead of the 3 percent raise offered by the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corporation (SMSC). In response, the SMSC sued forty-one active union members for damages allegedly caused by the strike and relieved twenty-four leading union officials of their duties.60 Nevertheless, Pusan subway workers also went on strike on Saturday morning, June 25.61\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 26, a Sunday, the authorities took action against both railroad and subway workers. More than 5,000 police broke into Kyung Hee University around 5:00 a.m. that morning to disperse nearly 1,800 railway and subwayworkers and sympathizers and make arrests. Most of the students and union members had fled at 4:00 a.m., before the raid, but some resisted forcibly, hurling firebombs and wielding steel pipes for nearly twenty minutes before retreating. Around 800 of the students who left Kyung Hee University went to Dongduck Women's University, where sixty union members and twenty-three students were apprehended in a police raid at about 6:30 a.m. Police also raided a church in downtown Seoul to apprehend striking subway workers who had been staging a sit-in there. Arrest warrants were issued for Kim Yeon-hwan, head of the union at the SMSC, and Seo Sun-won, chairman of Chongihyop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The KNR classified the strikers according to their participation in order to decide punishment for them. Some 500 employees, including 210 who had not returned to work after they were released by the police, were given a warning; the same penalty was handed out to the executives of the union headquarters and branch offices.62 But 108 strikers were fired, including twenty-eight members of Chongihyop and seventy engineers who abandoned their trains or removed engine parts when the strike started.63 By June 28, the country's railroad operations had returned to normal-the KNR reported that 98 percent of all striking locomotive and assistant engineers had returned to work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government's crackdown broke Chongihyup. According to a dismissed railway worker interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia,\n",
      "\n",
      "The independent organization doesn't exist anymore. After the arrests the government forced the workers to retreat. The railways management asked the members to withdraw from Chongihyup by threatening them with further mistreatment, including transfer to other jobs.64\n",
      "\n",
      "The government's refusal to negotiate with the union, based on its claim that the organization was \"illegal,\" violated Korea's international obligations to uphold freedom of association and contravened a worker's right to join a union of his choosing. This abusive pretext provided the basis for the police action against the strikers and the railway's actions in disciplining the participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subway workers continued their strike for several days. On June 30, the Catholic cardinal, the Anglican primate bishop, the president of the Korean Bar Association, and others all appealed to the striking workers to return to work.65 That afternoon the union withdrew its strike, asking the workers to return by 9:00 p.m. the following day. The 127 workers who remained absent were severely disciplined by the SMSC. Union chair Kim Yeon-hwan and seventeen other union leaders, against whom warrants had already been issued, decided to carry on their sit-in regardless of the decision to end the strike, and they were arrested.66\n",
      "\n",
      "The government used the \"third party intervention\" provision of Korea's labor laws to prosecute union leaders, in violation of international standards protecting freedom of expression. Seo Sun-won, a railway worker and leader of Chongihyup, was charged with \"third party intervention.\" The authorities claimed that he had attended a meeting of subway workers before their strike action in June 1994 and had stated, \"let's struggle together.\" The court convicted Seoand sentenced him to two years of imprisonment.67 On appeal, his sentence was shortened to eighteen months.68 Kim Yeon-hwan, president of the Seoul subway trade union, was originally charged with both \"business interference\" and \"third party intervention\" and originally sentenced to two years of imprisonment. On appeal, the original decision was annulled, and his sentence was reduced to imprisonment for one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 28, 1994, arrest warrants on charges of \"third party intervention\" were issued for Kwon Young-kil and Yang Kyu-heon, two co-presidents of the Korean Council of Trade Unions (KCTU). Among other bases for the charges, authorities cited the two leaders' speeches at the \"Resolution Rally for Railway and Subway Workers' Solidarity Struggle\" on June 2, 1994 and statements at a press conference held in the press room of the Ministry of Labor the same day. The prosecutors claimed that these speeches by the KCTU co-presidents instigated strikes at the Korean National Railroad, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corporation, and the Pusan subway. They also cited speeches at the KCTU-sponsored \"Resolution Rally for `94 Wage Hike Campaign and Reinstatement of Dismissed Unionists\" held on May 1, 1994, as well as a comment at the KCTU National Council Meeting on May 20, 1994.69\n",

      "Hyundai Motor\n",
      "\n",
      "In May 1995, deteriorating working conditions and increased production quotas took their toll at the Hyundai Motor plants in Ulsan: a dismisssed union shop steward burned himself to death in protest against company policy, and the workers launched a wildcat strike to echo and support his protest. On the night of May 19, the work stoppage culminated in a police raid on an encampment of workers inside the factory gates. Although the workers offered only passive resistance, police officers pounded them with batons and heavy shields while taking them into custody. Human Rights Watch/Asia recognizes the need to use police force in certain circumstances, but in this case the initial use of force was excessive and unjustified. Furthermore, the raid at Hyundai Motor was followed up by arbitrary criminal charges-third party intervention-against union leaders, and the Hyundai strike was used to scapegoat and target independent workers' organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hyundai Group, founded in 1947, is Korea's largest producer of automobiles and ships and a number of other industrial items. Several of its subsidiaries, including Hyundai Engine, Hyundai Shipbuilding, Hyundai Motors and Hyundai Heavy Industries, are located in the port city of Ulsan, 175 miles southeast of Seoul. The Hyundai Group grew rapidly in the 1970s as a result of President Park Chung-hee's economic strategy favoring heavy industry. Hyundai workers were in the forefront of the labor movement when controls on union activities eased in 1987. Thus the events at Hyundai in May 1995 were viewed as siginificant for the labor movement as a whole. According to one independent labor activist:\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor action at Hyundai Motor had far-ranging significance: it galvanized the labor movement at other large companies. The government and business community sees Hyundai Motor as an important test case because they want it to be a model of collaborationist union policy. The strike exposed the reality of the so-called \"labor-management collaboration\" and had a profound effect on the mood on the shop floor.70\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hyundai automotive operations, the country's largest auto manufacturer, produce some 4,700 passenger cars daily. In 1994 Hyundai produced 1.14 million cars, exporting 390,000.71 Union activists interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia emphasized that there had been a dramatic deterioration in working conditions at Hyundai Motors in the last two years. They linked this to President Kim's \"globalization\" policy and to the 1993 elections of what they called a \"collaborationist\" union leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been a campaign of labor intensification at Hyundai. Since 1993, and the election of a new union leadership, there has been a 30 percent increase in working hours and a doubling of the rate of industrial accidents. In 1992, there were 315 industrial accidents at Hyundai Motor. By contrast in 1994, there were 600 industrial accidents.72\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 1995, Yang Bong-soo, a twenty-eight-year-old union shop steward with five years' seniority, helped lead a work stoppage on his production line to protest labor intensification at the Hyundai Motor No. 1 Plant. On February 20, Yang was dismissed along with a number of other activists. Nevertheless, Yang was legally authorized to continue serving as a shop steward, and at the end of April he attended a meeting on company premises with union and management personnel to discuss problems arising from the intensified production quotas and workloads. Plant security guards forcibly removed him from Hyundai property during that meeting; and the guards beat him, such that Yang required two weeks of medical treatment. Yang then filed a lawsuit against two guards and a manager over the beating.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 12, Yang was prevented by company personnel from entering the plant to attend another union meeting.73 He is reported to have shouted, \"Dismissed workers have the right to enter the plant and carry on union activities, so stop preventing us from entering,\" as he doused himself with paint thinner. He then shouted to the guards, \"If you approach me, I will set myself on fire.\" Yang moved onto company property, and as five security guards closed in on him, he set himself aflame. With third degree burns over 75 percent of his body, he was taken to Tongsan Hospital in Taegu for treatment.74\n",
      "\n",
      "Twelve workers, including three former Hyundai Motor union presidents-Lee Sang-bum, Lee Hun-koo, and Yoon Sung-keun-formed a \"Countermeasures Committee for Yang Bong-soo's Self-Immolation\" to continue the struggle on his behalf. The group, which was launched without the approval of the existing Hyundai Motor union leadership, issued several demands: that the company pay Yang's medical expenses, that Hyundai reinstate dismissed workers, and that the officials involved in the May 12 incident be punished.75\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 13, workers at Car Plant No. 2 began a protest work stoppage. Nearly 1,000 night-shift workers halted the assembly line at 4:15 a.m. Then, 1,200 morning- and afternoon-shift employees refused to go to work, and nearly 1,500 workers staged a rally at the company's administration hall at noon that day to demand that all the workers dismisssed for labor actions be reinstated and that those Hyundai officials responsible for Yang Bong-soo's attempted suicide be punished.76\n",
      "\n",
      "On Monday, May 15, a work stoppage closed down assembly lines No. 1 and No. 2. The following day workers shut down lines No. 3 and No. 4 to protest Yang's dismissal and ask for his immediate reinstatement as well as an apology. The stoppage virtually eliminated the company's entire daily production quota. It was not, however, supported by the elected Hyundai Motor union leadership. That leadership, accused by the Countermeasures Commmittee of being pro-management, charged that the militant workers were instigated by outsiders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other units of the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions, an organization of unions at the various Hyundai units and a pillar of the democratic trade unions forces, began to mobilize support for the Hyundai Motor workers. 77 For example, Yoon Jae-koon, president of the Federation, spoke openly in support of the automobile workers. On May 16, management filed a complaint with the police against the twelve members of the Countermeasures Committee accusing them of agitation and interference in production. Police issued summonses and began collecting evidence for criminal charges. 78 On May 17, Hyundai Motor Co. announced that it was suspending production and closing down the automobile plants in a lock-out. Hundreds of union activists remained inside the gates nevertheless.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the first time in nearly two years, Hyundai's auto production stopped. The company feared heavy losses at a time when Korea's auto industry was enjoying a lift as a result of a strong Japanese yen.79 Hyundai officials claimed that the strike was costing the company nearly $50 million a day, estimating that since the beginning of the labor action, a week earlier, Hyundai's production schedule had been set back some 16,000 units.80 It was a particularly tense moment nationally, as well, with manufacturers facing tense labor negotiations over a government-imposed wage guideline at the same time the country was preparing for the first local and provincial elections in thirty years.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 17, some 5,000 workers rallied on the grounds of Hyundai Motor in defiance of a veiled warning by the government that it would deploy riot police to quell \"illegal\" acts.81 Labor Affairs Minister Lee Hyung-koo strongly hinted that the government would use police force to break the strike and detain the twelve militant union leaders, including three former Hyundai Motor union leaders.82 The labor minister also warned the other components of the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions against joining the striking automotive workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 18, the police obtained arrest warrants-on the charge of \"business interference\"-and detained the twelve leaders of the Countermeasures Committee, who were convicted in the ensuing months for their role in the May protests. Five received one-year sentences. These include: Lee Sang-bum (a former union president), Lee Hun-koo (a former union president), Yoon Sung-keun (a former union president), Kim Kwang-sik (shop steward, Plant 1, Rigging Department), and Lee Jae-in (Plant 2, Rigging Department 2). Six others, convicted on \"business interference\" charges, received three-year suspended sentences. These include: Lee Duck-kee (deputy shop steward, Plant 3), Moon Yong-moon (Plant 4), Baek Yong-ho (Plant 2, Frame Department 2), Son Tae-hyun (shop steward, Plant 1), Kim Hwa-sik (deputy shop steward, Plant 2), and Kim Kee-nam (Plant 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 26, the authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the chair of the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions, Yoon Jae-keon, for violating the prohibition on \"third party intervention.\" The charges were based on two speeches Yoon had made on May 13 and May 17 outside the Hyundai Motors plant gate supporting the striking autoworkers. In addition, the prosector's office levelled \"third party intervention\" charges against Lee Yong-jin, general secretary of the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions, and Lee Seung-pil, head of the Masan Regional Council of Trade Unions. These two leaders also made public statements supporting the Hyundai Motor workers at the May 17 solidarity rally. The legal charges blatantly violated Korea's international obligations to respect freedom of expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government's motivation for pressing these charges was revealed in a statement by Economy and Finance Minister Hong Jae-hyung just hours after the pre-dawn raid of May 19. He told reporters, \"The government will crack down hard on any illegal labor disputes and will not hesitate in using police force. We must not miss the current economic boom because of illegal labor disputes.\"83 Later that same day, the government issued a warning, read by Deputy Prime Minister Hong Jae-hyung, that labor disputes could seriously hurt the country's booming economy.84 The Prosecutor General's Office followed with an announcement that it would launch an investigation of two militant union groups it accused of plotting \"to topple\" moderate union leaders-the Federation of the Hyundai Group Trade Unions and the KCTU-affiliated groups preparing the launching of the national democratic trade union center.85 The government's rhetoric suggested that the groundwork was being laid for future attacks on independent union organizations. Meanwhile the authorities called in 4,000 riot troops to Ulsan from other cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Police Raid\n",
      "\n",
      "At 4:00 a.m. on May 19, over 1,000 riot police raided the Hyundai Motor plant. The police had massed at a nearby crossroads and entered through the front and Myongchon gates. The workers, who had erected tents for shelter inside the main gate of the plant, put up only passive resistance to the police. Several hundred riot police searched the plant for the twelve members of the Countermeasures Committee. In all, 279 striking workers were taken into custody. Lee Sang-bum, a member of the Countermeasures Committee and a former union president, was arrested for \"business interference.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "One Hyundai Motor unionist who worked closely with Yang Bong-soo and was interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia gave the following account:\n",
      "\n",
      "The police had arrest warrants for the twelve leaders [the members of the Countermeasures Committee]. In the tents were members of the Countermeasures Committee. The workers tried to protect the leaders by making a human chain. They began shouting, \"No violence, no violence.\" The police knew the leadership was in the tents behind the human fence so as many as four riot police grabbed one worker at a time to take apart the human chain. The workers guarding the leaders were arrested. Five members of the Countermeasures Committee were arrested on charges of \"business interference\" that morning. Two workers resisted arrest, and the police used a lot of violence against them, punching them. The riot police destroyed the tents and trampled on them to arrest the workers. It took thirty minutes to carry out the arrests.86\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrested workers were placed in special riot police buses with iron bars on the windows. The workers were put on benches and told to put their heads on their knees. When they resisted, they were beaten with batons. The military police were young, and they kicked the workers, who were generally much older, with their military boots while using humiliating language. The workers were taken for interrogation to police stations in Ulsan.\n",
      "\n",
      "While there was no worker-initiated violence at the automobile plant, there was a violent protest as 200 workers fought with police outside of Hyundai Precision Industries (HPI) next door to Hyundai Motor. According to one Hyundai worker interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia, some of the workers who had been at the tent encampment had eluded the police raid and jumped across the wall from the auto plant to the adjacent HPI plant. They began to hurl bricks at the police, who responded with tear gas. The relatively small group of workers retreated to a nearby market. It was early morning, and there were many old people at the market. The police used tear gas, which affected the older people at the market, and arrested nearly twenty workers, beating them with heavy shields. The detained workers were then loaded on police buses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers on the bus were ordered not to talk, and when they resisted in any way, they were hit. Once inside the police station, they were ordered to sit on the ground and face downward. The police held them for the maximum twenty-four hours allowable without charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to another worker at the scene:\n",
      "\n",
      "The workers who were arrested for participating in stone throwing were taken to Ulsan Eastern station. The police knew I was among the workers who had thrown stones and I was beaten in retaliation. It is not uncommon for the police to put an arrested person who resists in a darkened room and beat him harshly with batons and boots. This happened to one man I know, Suh Yong-taek.87\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to the arrests, the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions held protest rallies at five other Hyundai facilities during the lunch hour on May 19.88 The leadership of the Hyundai Motor union issued a statement expressing regret over the raid and demanded that the police remaining inside the plant be withdrawn immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Riot police remained on alert in Ulsan to thwart posible worker protests, but on May 23, 1,500 officers withdrew from the areas around the Hyundai Motor facilities,89 and workers began to return to the assembly lines. Also on May 23, the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions, the organization of the unions at the Hyundai conglomerate which had actively supported the automobile workers's strike, retracted its previous instructions to members to boycott overtime work. The workers' anger persisted, however. On May 30, some 2,500 riot police were deployed around Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) in response to a strike threat at that shipbuilding facility.90 Police searched ships entering and leaving the HHI docks and shipyards, while a police helicopter flew overheard in an effort to arrest two union leaders wanted on \"third party intervention\" charges, Yoon Jae-keun (chair of the Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions) and HHI union secretary general Lee Yong-jin. The charges were based on the speeches these union leaders had given at the May 17 solidarity rally for the striking automobile workers. Police teams were stationed at intersections throughout Ulsan and carried out house-to-house searches for the two. At the docks, a group of 150 union activists locked the entrances and stayed overnight in an effort to prevent police entry. Nine other Hyundai subsidiaries in Ulsan decided to boycott overtimework despite the leadership's instructions.91 Then, after they lost track of the union leaders who had gone into hiding, police suspended plans to raid HHI.92\n",

      "This was the situation when Yang Bong-soo died of complications from his self-immolation at Tongsan Hospital in Taegu early in the morning of June 13.93 Police deployed 2,000 officers around the hospital morgue where Yang's body was being held. Hyundai management held an emergency meeting to discuss Yang's death and dispatched officials to the hospital to discuss funeral arrangements with his family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thousands of Hyundai Motor union members held a memorial rally near the auto plant in commemoration of Yang Bong-soo on June 14. The Federation of Hyundai Group Trade Unions declared a week-long memorial period for Yang and held a rally in Ulsan on Monday, June 19.94 In a union election three months later, the autoworkers ousted the Hyundai Motors union leadership, which had been criticized by the Countermeasures Committee and its supporters as being \"collaborationist. \"\n",

      "Korea Telecom\n",
      "\n",
      "Korea Telecom (KT) is the government-run monopoly at the center of the country's telecommunications network. KT handles domestic and foreign telephone calls and other aspects of Korea's telecommunications. In May 1995, as negotiations over a wage ceiling and company privatization plans began to intensify, the authorities coupled inflammatory rhetoric with arbitrary arrests to undermine protections for freedom of assembly and the right to engage in collective bargaining. Hours after the pre-dawn police raid on the Hyundai plant on May 19, President Kim Young-sam warned that his government would take \"stringent measures\" against any striking union members at KT. According to the president, any intention to strike KT was tantamount to intent to \"overthrow the government.\"95 The same day, Communications Minister Kyong Sam-hyon told a Seoul press conference that \"lawbreakers\" at Korea Telecom would \"certainly be punished\" and that a strike would wreak havoc with the country's communications network.96 In this highly charged situation, provisions of Korean criminal law were used to authorize arbitrary arrests and detentions in violation of basic labor rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "On April 25, 1995, the Ministry of Information and Communications and the mangement of KT accused sixty-four union officers, including eleven members of the union's bargaining committee, of \"business interference.\" According to a spokesman for the union, the charges against the leaders of the Korea Telecom union grew out of two 1994 incidents: 1) the occupation of the office of the Minister of Information and Telecommunications and 2) obstruction of business at a KT Board of Directors meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the first incident, on July 27 and July 28, 1994, twenty to thirty workers occupied the offices of the Minister of Information and Telecommunications located in the Korea Telecom building. They left when the minister promised to consider the changes they had requested. The second incident was the culmination of an intense argument betweenworkers and management. When the company's Board of Directors met on December 15, 1994 to discuss the sale of a large number of stocks, the union argued that at least some of the money should be set aside for the workers. There were two bargaining sessions on this, and just before the planned third session, the Board of Directors scheduled its own meeting. The union asked for a postponement because of the special collective bargaining already in process, but the company and the ministry refused. The workers protested first by holding a silent sit-in protest outside the room. The company moved the meeting to a secret location. The workers discovered the location and tried to enter the meeting. When they were refused access, they entered anyway, protested verbally and pulled out some ceiling tile. Tension remained high for a few hours. The police were not called because, while the atmosphere was tense, there was no threat of physical violence. On December 19, 1994 Korea Telecom President Cho Baek-je announced that the company would allocate funds for the KT workers. There was no threat at that time of the legal reprisals that would follow in April 1995.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in early May 1995, KT union leaders called for collective bargaining to end a government-imposed wage ceiling, to review the opening of the telecommunications service market to foreign companies and to privatize the company. 97 According to a KT union spokesperson:\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue of privatization lurked in the background of the negotiations. The union's position is not absolutely against privatization, but we want to investigate and air the issues. The government is against open discussion, and our raising the question angered the authorities.98\n",
      "\n",
      "Revealing the government's larger purpose, on May 8 the Supreme Public Prosecutor's office issued a Special Order for the arrest of leaders of the Korean Council of Trade Unions (KCTU). The KCTU was preparing to launch a new autonomous national trade union center on November 11, 1995. The wanted unionists included the two co-presidents, Kwon Young-kil and Yang Kyu-heon. The arrest order stated that the KCTU leadership was intending to link negotiations over wages-including the Korea Telecom bargaining-with the June 27 election. At 11:00 a.m. on May 16, just hours before another scheduled round of collective bargaining, KT management held a press conference at the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications to announce that it was disciplining sixty-four union officers for engaging in \"illegal activities and preparing a strike.\" The union condemned the disciplinary action against its officers, including the union's negotiators, while negotiations were underway. The company promptly refused to meet with those union representatives against whom disciplinary action had been taken, thus breaking off negotiations. In response, the union issued a call for protest rallies on May 17. The same day, KT President Cho Baek-je issued a statement saying he was firing union activists \"to prevent a strike.\" At 7:00 p.m., 7,000 union members rallied at KT headquarters demanding that the punishments be withdrawn and that the suppression of the union be ended.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 18, the prosecutor's office issued arrest warrants on charges of \"business interference\" for the union leaders against whom the Ministry of Information and Communications had taken disciplinary action.99 Citing the warrants, Korea Telecom management again refused to meet with the union's leadership. The next day the union threatened to strike unless the company rescinded its plans to punish the its leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 19-the same day riot police stormed the workers' tent city inside the gates of the Hyundai Motor Plant-President Kim Young-sam issued his statement characterizing the strike threat at Korea Telecom as tantamount to a struggle \"to overthrow the state.\" Such language, ignoring universally recognized guarantees of freedom of association and expression, inflamed an already tense situation. In response, the workers began a work slowdown and the union stated that it would launch a strike, if the police moved against its members. The Supreme Prosecutor's Office moved to arrestfifteen Korea Telecom union leaders, including chair Yu Duk-sang, for their \"illegal labor activities\" and pushed ahead with prosecutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to one independent labor activist interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia:\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 19 President Kim made his notorious statement that the KT workers were planning violent and illegal activities leading to strikes and the overthrow of the government. Because the president put it in these terms, all government forces were mobilized for a harsh crackdown. 100\n",
      "\n",
      "On May 20, the union called for a ten-day cooling-off period to promote good faith negotiations and avoid a disruption of telecommunications. The union urged the government and management to refrain from any disciplinary steps or legal actions and promised the union would not unilaterally take any collective action.101 A union spokesperson later told Human Rights Watch/Asia that the government was hoping to create a backlash against the independent labor movement that would favor the ruling party in the June 27 elections. In May 1995, President Kim's approval rating was reported to have hit an all-time low since his February 1993 inauguration and there was speculation that he was seeking to project a strong image to appeal to conservative voters.102 The Telecom spokesperson also told Human Rights Watch/Asia that the government was attempting to destroy or cripple an important component of the KCTU before the November founding of the national center of independent trade unions. 103\n",
      "\n",
      "The minister of information and telecommunication promptly rejected the union's proposal and began to take emergency measures to handle a possible strike, including the use of military personnel. The senior presidential economic secretary, Han Yi-hon, stated that the KT union had initiated a dispute on subjects not proper for collective bargaining but for ulterior political purposes.104 This was one of several government efforts to portray the KT union's actions as politically motivated-or , as one unionist described it, to use \"red scare\" tactics to create an anti-union backlash. A week later, South Korea's Prime Minister, Lee Hong-koo, publicly stated that the government was adopting a tough response to the threat of collective action at Korea Telecom to prevent labor disputes from spreading. He went on to announce that the Korea Telecom workers appeared \"to have links with the outlawed trade unions.\" Reinforcing this theme, an unnamed presidential aide, suggesting North Korean instigation, said, \"It's no coincidence that this is occurring at an organization vital to our national defense.\"105\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days after President Kim's statement, a massive crackdown began. Starting late in the night of May 21 and continuing into the early morning hours of May 22, some 20,000 police officers were mobilized to hunt down and arrestthe KT union leaders before the June 27 elections.106 Police squads raided the homes of union officials and apprehended five. Three were arrested, and two were booked and then released.107\n",
      "\n",
      "Later on Monday, May 22, the government issued arrest warrants for the other KT union officials, including President Yoo Duk-sang, and closed down the union's offices.108 The authorities intensified their efforts to apprehend other KCTU officials, Kwon Yong-mok (chair of the Executive Committee) and Heo Young-koo (chair of the KCTU Executive Committee). In an effort to publicize their demands, six KT union officers, including the disputes director, the education director and the women's director, established an emergency office in a room of the human rights committee of Myongdong Cathedral, a highly respected religious center in downtown Seoul that the police had never forcibly entered, even during military rule. The next day, 3,000 union members gathered outside the cathedral to support the leaders meeting inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, the government's anti-union drive crossed over into confrontation with the political opposition. At dawn on May 23, forty riot police stormed the headquarters of the opposition Democratic Party, where members of the \"Special Committee for Restoration of Arrested, Dismissed and Wanted Unionists to the Status Quo\" were holding a peaceful sit-in to protest the crackdown on labor. Chang Young-kil (chair of the Special Committee), Kim Je-yeon (general secretary of the Korea Telecom union), Park Jung-soo (a dismissed Daewoo Precision worker), and Heo Tae-koo (a dismissed Poongsan worker) were apprehended and arrested. Meanwhile, hundreds of riot police maintained a tight blockade around Myongdong Cathedral in downtown Seoul, where KT union leaders had sought refuge to continue their union work.109\n",
      "\n",
      "Simultaneously, the government ordered riot police to take up positions at the KT union offices and prevent worker access to them. Management fired eleven union officers, including Yoo Duk-sang, and summoned sixty-four union officials to appear before a company disciplinary board.110 On May 28, hundreds of riot police sealed off Chogye Temple, another revered religious institution in downtown Seoul where seven KT union leaders were on hunger strike. At the same time, the police tightened their blockade around Myongdong Cathedral.111 On May 29, Prosecutor General Kim To-on told the press he would \"pursue Korea Telecom union leaders to the end\" and bring them to justice for \"taking the national telecommunication network hostage and staging illegal collective actions for political purposes.\"112 He added that the demands posed by the union were all related to the government's economic policies and as such were not appropriate for labor-management discussion.113 An Kang-min, director of the Public Security Department of the Prosecutor General's office, said that \"if the situation lingers on, we would find it unavoidable to use police under legal procedures.\"114 Late on May 30, the police presented arrest warrants to religious officials at the cathedral and the temple, triggering angryprotests from both religious communities. In a statement, Myongdong Cathedral officials said \"Myongdong Cathedral has been playing a moral role as a sanctuary, even during the past military dictatorship. We feel sad to see this role being marred by the civilian government.\"115 A group of Catholic priests also issued a statement, warning of all-out resistance by the Catholic church and joint action with the Buddhist community if their sanctuaries were invaded. They stated that the Korea Telecom workers had not carried out their strike threat and urged the government to delay executing the arrest warrants, and open talks with the union. On May 29, a group of 223 professors at thirty-seven universities across the country issued an appeal to the government to stop suppressing \"legitimate unionism.\"116\n",
      "\n",
      "That same day, Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo stressed that the labor dispute at KT had to be resolved within a week to prevent labor problems from spreading. \"Should the dispute continue beyond this week, it will be linked with progressive labor organizations and make the situation more complicated. Accordingly it should be resolved within the week...Once the dispute comes to have links with outlawed trade unions, it will quickly spread across the country. This should be prevented from happening.\"117 Implying that the places of worship would be raided, Yi said, \"There is no need whatsoever for the civilian government to protect the interests of a specific organization. This should be well publicized to the citizens.\" 118Agreeing with the prime minister, Vice Information and Communications Minister Yi Kye-chol said, \"The situation will subside if and when core union leaders are detained. In the event the dispute is prolonged, chances are high it will be linked with illegal trade organizations and expanded.\"119 In a related move, KT President Cho Baek-je called upon the heads of the two places of worship to persuade union leaders to end their sit-in and surrender themselves.120\n",
      "\n",
      "Early on June 6, the riot police stormed Myongdong Cathedral and Chogye Temple. Yonhap Television news showed plainclothes police dragging the thirteen men out of tents and makeshift shelters constructed at the two religious centers. Among those the police seized at Myongdong were Chang Hyun-il (head of the dispute department), Park Soo-ho (bargaining director), and Chung Yong-chil (a union branch secretary). Yang Han-woong (KT union adviser), Kim Jong-keun (head of the union organizing department), Kim Se-ok (union international director), and Park Choong-bum (union wage director) were among those arrested at Chogye Temple. They were charged with \"business interference\" and \"violence.\" 121\n",
      "\n",
      "According to one activist, the union made a major concession in an effort to meet the company's terms by not insisting on the old negotiating team. Just before the police raids on Myongdong Cathedral and Chogye Buddhist Temple, the Korea Telecom union had decided to exclude the union leaders who were facing charges before the corporate disciplinary board. The union had accepted the company's claim and wanted to resume negotiations.122\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 7, the authorities resorted to the use of excessive force again. Following a pro-union street demonstration that had proceeded peacefully, riot police charged a human barricade of priests and lay followers into MyongdongCathedral to rout dozens of students who had taken refuge there. Church officials quoted eyewitnesses as saying that, inside the cathedral, police badly beat students in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary as appalled priests and nuns looked on.123 This was the second police invasion of the cathedral in two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "To prevent KT labor unrest from spreading, on June 7, the government also sent riot police to block a meeting of 300 Korean Telecom union chapter leaders from around the country in the National Council of Christian Churches Building in downtown Seoul. The arriving trade unionists were confronted by some 400 police in addition to officials from Korea Telecom, who violating the workers' right of free assembly, prevented the KT unionists from entering the building. Police arrested and questioned thirty-two union leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same day, the government moved to toughen Korea Telecom management's stance even further. President Kim Young-sam fired Cho Baek-jae as head of KT, and appointed a retired four-star general, Lee Jun, as his successor.124 After firing Cho, Kim Young-sam made clear the signal he wanted to send by General Lee's appointment. The president told the press, \"The way this incident is handled will demonstrate the government's determination that no illegalities will go unpunished.\"125 The appointment had wider political motives as well. The selection of Lee Jun was seen as part of President Kim's effort to woo conservatives, as his base of political support was shifting rightward among factions in the ruling party. Cho had come under increasing fire from the ruling party for failing to contain the dispute at Korea Telecom, which was becoming a political liability for the government as the June 27 elections neared. The elections were increasingly seen as a mid-term referendum on President Kim and his policies.126\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 9, twenty-seven senior Catholic Church leaders issued a statement demanding that the government apologize for sending police into Myongdong Cathedral. \"We will ask the government to sincerely apologize to the church and the nation and promise that such an incident will not recur ... We urge a prompt government response and will watch whether the government complies or not.\"127\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the raids on the Cathedral and Chogye temple and mounting denunciations by religious leaders, there were growing indications that the government's tactics had lost it popular support and the union, which had not initiated any strike action, began to gain sympathy among the public for its flexibility. There were several demonstrations in downtown Seoul protesting the government's raid on the religious centers. For example, on June 13, 25,000 people gathered in the capital to demand that President Kim apologize, dismiss the arrest charges and promote a climate for negotiations.128 Religious leaders met with government officials and tried to mediate the dispute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting the negative public reaction, Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo issued a statement to the press on June 16, belatedly expressing the government's regrets over the June 6 police raids at Myongdong Cathedral and Chogye Buddhist Temple. The statement said:\n",
      "\n",
      "I express deep regrets over inconveniences and sufferings inflicted upon the church and the temple which have special status and historic meaning in our society. I deeply understand the fact that the religious circles are expressing deep worries and sufferings over the matter.129\n",
      "\n",
      "The statement went on, however, to reiterate the government's position that churches and temples should not be considered \"safe areas for illegal struggle\" or \"extraterritorial areas.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Denial of Freedom of Association for Teachers\n",
      "\n",
      "Public school teachers in South Korea are regarded as part of the civil service, and private school teachers are treated as if they were civil servants. As such, they are not permitted, under Korean law, the enjoyment of the right to choose their own union and associate freely. Under Korean law, teachers are classified as educational public servants and under the Public Servants Act, they are prohibited from organizing, engaging in collective bargaining, and taking collective action.130 The Private School Act extends this prohibition to private school teachers.131 The government contends that teachers' unions have no legal basis because teachers cannot be treated as workers. Accordingly, teachers have been dismissed-1,500 in 1989-and arrested for activities in support of an independent union known as the Korean Teachers and Educational Workers' Union (Chunkyojo).\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunkyojo was launched on May 28, 1989 despite a legal ban on collective action by public sector employees and the arrest and dismissal of one hundred union organizers less than two weeks earlier. Before Chunkyojo was formed, the only organization representing the interests of teachers was the government-sponsored Korean Federation of Education Association (KFEA), which included administrators as well as teachers and functioned more like a professional association than a union.132\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunkyojo, without lawful status to represent teachers, nonetheless claims to have fifteen provincial offices, 157 municipal branches, and 3,000 school branches serving 15,000 members, with 30,000 additional dues-paying supporters.133 The organization engages in various activities to improve the educational system, to obtain better treatment for teachers, to eliminate \"ideologically motivated education,\" and to increase the education budget. Members meet regularly to discuss school curricula and to organize other activities on subjects ranging from environmental protection to reunification with the North.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a Chunkyojo spokesperson:\n",
      "\n",
      "The government says that under the circumstances that Korea is a divided country, it cannot allow a teachers' union. It reinforces that with reference to Confucian ideology that a teacher is not a worker. We can only function as a professional association, discussing professional issues, but not as a union. The government can prohibit our having a union, but they cannot prohibit our managing an office.134\n",
      "\n",
      "The Public Servants Act and the Private School Act were cited to justify massive dismissals when Chunkyojo was founded in 1989. For their union membership, 1,487 teachers were fired. An additional 200, almost all private school teachers, were subsequently dismissed due to their union sympathies. There followed a long struggle to reinstate the dismissed teachers. After 1989 many dismissed teachers brought lawsuits to gain reinstatement. Most of these cases were rejected, but the courts did order some teachers reinstated when the judges found that their activities had caused no harm to the \"social order or education.\"135 In December 1989, a district court in Kochang ordered the reinstatement of two private school teachers on these grounds.136 However, the Ministry of Education refused to obey the court's judgment and the two were not reinstated until a petition drive and sympathetic public opinion compelled Kim Young-sam's administration to re-instate over 1,300 dismissed teachers.137\n",
      "\n",
      "Teachers who were still employed formed an organization, the Council for Reinstating Teachers, and they began a signature campaign for reinstatement. Dismissed teachers, teachers still employed, and non-teachers as well took signature boards into the streets, collecting more than 1,000,000 signatures by the end of 1992. This was the largest petition drive in the country's history.138 Some members of the Council for Reinstating Teachers were themselves dismissed, under the Public Servants Act, as a result of the campaign. Other teachers were arrested and charged with various offenses. The authorities claimed that there was no public support for teacher unionizing, but the success of the signature drive suggested that there was a great deal of popular support for the union.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the terms of reinstatement for those dismisssed in 1989 required those teachers to sign a form stating that they had withdrawn from the Korean Teachers and Educational Workers' Union. The government-issued form stated, \"It [was] a clear violation of the law when teachers formed the trade union. It [was] against the national sentiments and our conventional views on education that teachers pretend[ed] to be workers and forwarded their demands through trade union activities.\" The statement continued: \"The Government came to the conclusion that only those who declare publicly their withdrawal for Chunkyojo should be reinstated.\"139\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 18, 1993, the Minister of Education issued a statement declaring that: \"Those who ran for election [for the position] of regional or branch chairman or are involved in Chunkyojo meetings and rallies at the schools or [work at Chunkyojo office] will be excluded immediately from the list for reinstatement.\" The statement added that the act of \"demanding legal recognition of the teachers' trade union, collective action in the name of teachers' rights or interference with the justified school management by school masters will be subject to serious disciplinary actions.\"140\n",
      "\n",
      "In a \"personal statement\" drafted by the Ministry of Education that was addressed to the chairmen of the Provincial School Authority, teachers were required to promise not to support union activities. The statement read, \"I shall not join in any Chunkyojo activities. Upon returning to school, I shall direct all of my enthusiasm and efforts towardteaching students.\"141 Teachers were excluded from reinstatement if they refused to sign the declaration. In addition, the government declined to reinstate over forty applicants who wrote that they withdrew from Chunkyojo but believed the union should be legalized.\n",
      "\n",
      "The union accepted the conditions and Chung Hae-sook, president of Chunkyojo, issued a statement saying, \"The governmental will to reform is not strong enough to settle the reinstatement problem without conditions. Chunkyojo will accept the reinstatement condition so that the dismissed teachers can return to school to carry out true education.\"142\n",
      "\n",
      "Continued Denial of Free Expression for Teachers\n",
      "\n",
      "Of similar concern is the continued harassment of teachers actively expressing their views on educational reform, a clear violation of their right of free expression. On May 10, 1995, activist teachers in Seoul unveiled the \"One Hundred Teachers' Declaration for Genuine Educational Reform\" and presented it in summary form to the government's Educational Reform Committee, which is directly responsible to the President Kim Young-sam's office. Subsequently, the Seoul Education Board took punitive action against five of these teachers, including three representatives who had lobbied the Educational Reform Committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Seoul Education Board has demanded that these teachers confess their involvement with the declaration or undergo further investigation. After acknowledging that the teachers had not violated any law by submitting the declaration, the Seoul Education Board then accused the teachers of \"undertaking collective action\" and pressing for \"the legalization of the illegal Korean Teachers and Educational Workers' Union.\"143 The board demanded that the teachers repeal their declaration and sign promises that they would never again undertake such actions. It also took serious disciplinary action against five teachers in the form of salary reductions, suspensions, and dismissals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunkyojo has attempted to register its newspaper, Chunkyojo Shinmoon, with the Ministry of Information and Telecommunications so as to publish it \"officially,\" but the ministry rejected the application on the grounds that it was a platform for activities of an illegal organization. Despite this, 80,000 copies are published \"unofficially\" every ten days.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a teacher interviewed by Human Rights Watch/Asia:\n",
      "\n",
      "The government continues to repress teachers who participate in activities like the sixth commemoration of the founding of our union on May 28, 1995. The teachers who spoke at the rally were warned by their local school boards that they would be punished. Teachers who press for educational reform receive written warnings from the education authorities. In Taegu this spring, 300 teachers received written warnings.144\n",

      "VI. THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA'S APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION TO THE OECD\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 1995, the Republic of Korea applied for membership in the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the organization agreed to consider the application. Korea is the first Newly IndustrializedCountry (NIC) in East Asia to apply for membership, and this is the OECD's initial opportunity to consider regional labor laws and practices as part of its admission process. The way the OECD handles Korea's admission could define how carefully the organization adheres to its own human rights provisions in considering this and future applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch/Asia has urged the OECD to weigh Korea's labor laws and its labor rights practices carefully when evaluating its application for admission. A rights-sensitive approach is entirely consistent with the OECD's broader purpose. The organization, while obviously focused on economic issues, is rooted in a set of underlying principles expressed in its convention which emphasizes the importance of the \"preservation of individual liberty.\"145 The organization's commitment to human rights was underscored in its 1990 Ministerial Council Communiqué, which enumerated the \"common features\" of OECD countries, including \"respect for human rights.\" The 1992 Ministerial Council Communique emphasized that respect for human rights is intrinsically linked to economic development. In reviewing Korea's application, the OECD has the opportunity to emphasize an important principle-respect for international labor standards-and press the Korean government to revise its abusive labor legislation as an integral part of the process of admission.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the admission process, the organization's Trade Union Advisory Committee (TUAC) held a two-day seminar in mid-September to discuss Korea's labor laws and worker rights violations. Eager for admission to OECD, the government for the first time had agreed to meet not only with representatives of the officially permitted unions and OECD member states but with delegates of the country's independent-but not legally recognized-labor federations. At the last minute, however, the labor minister withdrew from participation in the meeting. His withdrawal signaled Seoul's intention to avoid confronting OECD labor rights concerns. It also posed an important challenge to the OECD itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Korean government's decision to boycott the OECD seminar followed a series of maneuvers aimed at thwarting OECD scrutiny of its record. Seoul had pressed to keep the representatives of the independent trade union federations from participating at all. After several months of negotiation, a compromise was reached that permitted their participation without mention of their \"non-lawful\" status. In the end, the government chose to send only unofficial \"observers.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "According to seminar participants, the discussion, focusing on provisions of Korean labor law that have been criticized by the International Labor Organization and United Nations, was productive.146 There was a consensus between the government-supported unions and the independent federations that the prohibition on \"third party intervention\"-authorizing arrest for merely expressing support of striking workers-should be abolished. On the other hand, while many questions arose about the country's labor laws, the government's absence made it impossible for participants to determine official attitudes or even get answers to questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This does not constitute adequate progress to justify Korea's admission. As part of its final report on the advisability of Korea's admission, the Trade Union Advisory Committee-and the OECD itself-must obtain specific governmental commitments to labor law reform within the shortest feasible timetable.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the completion of the seminar, the secretary-general of the OECD-TUAC publicly stated that the country's labor laws needed to be amended to allow for free and independent trade unions in accordance with OECD values.According to the secretary-general, respect for the basic rights of free association and the right to collective bargaining were urgently needed.147\n",

      "\n",
      "Like other governments, the Hungarian government anticipated that Covid-19 patients would quickly outnumber available beds in hospitals, and on April 7, ordered that hospitals free up 60 percent of their beds by discharging non-Covid-19 patients as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order aimed to free up 36,000 beds, though the exact number of patients affected is unknown because the government has not shared that information. What we do know is that many patients were kicked out but we also don’t know how many of them – some of whom have cancer or other chronic or terminal illnesses and require constant care – ended up in alternative care facilities or were sent home to be cared for by family members.\n",
      "\n",
      "Athina Nemeth, a hospice and volunteer home care worker in Budapest, told Human Rights Watch that she had cared for 10 patients who were sent home from hospitals abruptly, with no arrangements for care or treatment. She said patients’ families were only notified the day before or on the same day of their loved ones being discharged. One was sent home with an open stomach wound, another with a stoma bag. Other patients lacked diapers or oxygen. Nine of her patients have since died. Athina was able to secure placement in a private rehabilitation clinic for another patient discharged following an amputation. Independent media outlets have reported similar stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of May 3, there were 2,998 recorded cases of Covid-19 in Hungary, with 1,008 infected people in hospital and 340 deaths. We don’t know how many thousands of hospital beds might be empty, while other seriously ill people suffer at home with families unable to care for them properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measures to protect public health should be proportionate and necessary, and the response to medical demands of a pandemic should not deprive people of other essential health care. The Hungarian government should ensure the April 7 order does not create another human rights crisis, including by denying particularly vulnerable patients access to adequate medical care. They should ensure adequate numbers of beds in alternative care facilities and support the home care system with necessary funding. The authorities should also respond to concerns from professionals, patients, and their relatives with full transparency on the fate of patients removed from the care they were receiving.\n",

      "(Baghdad) – Militants who carried out a series of bomb attacks in Iraq on July 29, 2013, deliberately killing more than 60 people committed crimes against humanity, Human Rights Watch said today. Crimes against humanity are some of the most serious crimes under international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Islamic State of Iraq, as Al-Qaeda in Iraq now calls itself, has claimed responsibility, saying publicly that it organized and committed the July 29 attacks and a series of others over the last four months. Al-Qaeda in Iraq has issued statements claiming responsibility for numerous lethal suicide, car bomb, and other attacks in Iraq that, taken together, amount to an ongoing and systematic policy of killing civilians in gross breach of international law. On August 6 and August 10, another series of car bombs targeted busy markets, shopping streets, and parks where families were celebrating the end of Ramadan in and around Baghdad, killing at least 130 people, though no one has claimed responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The July 29 attacks, coming on top of other horrific attacks in recent months, provide clear evidence that Al-Qaeda in Iraq is guilty of crimes against humanity,” said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “No political goal or grievance can possibly justify this widespread and organized murder campaign, which is wreaking terrible suffering on Iraqis.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The July 29 attacks were some of the deadliest of 2013. The car bomb explosions, predominantly in Shia neighborhoods in Baghdad, killed more than 60 people and injured hundreds more, including many civilians. They were part of a surge of bomb attacks by al-Qaeda and other militant groups during Ramadan in both Shia and Sunni areas. Attacks also targeted state institutions and military installations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Together, these attacks made July the bloodiest month in over five years according to the United Nations. On August 1, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) released figures showing that acts of terrorism and violence in July claimed the lives of 1,057 Iraqis and wounded 2,326 others. The dead included 204 police officers and 129 members of the Iraqi Security Forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "The acting special representative for Iraq of the United Nations Secretary-General, Gyorgy Busztin, issued a statement on August 1 warning that the past months’ violence may herald a return to an era “when the blind rage of sectarian strife … inflicted … deep wounds upon this country.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to a report from the Institute for the Study of War, an independent research organization based in Washington, DC, Al-Qaeda in Iraq has repeatedly carried out attacks with vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices during a recent 12-month period. The report said these attacks – as many as eight bombings a day – “became more frequent and lethal” in spring 2013,” sometimes occurring twice a week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Islamic State of Iraq claimed responsibility on July 30 for the July 29 bombings. On July 23, the group issued a statement claiming responsibility for attacks two days earlier on two Baghdad-area prisons, Abu Ghraib and al-Tajji, which led to a mass escape of prisoners. According to a Justice Ministry statement, the attack on Abu Ghraib killed at least 68 members of the security forces and an unknown number of prisoners. Between 500 and 1,000 detainees escaped.\n",
      "\n",
      "In claiming responsibility for the prison attacks, the group said that attack, and others during the previous four months, were retaliation for an attack by government security forces on a Sunni protest camp in Hawija on April 23 that killed 51 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 6, car bombs in northern, eastern, and southern Baghdad targeted areas crowded with shoppers and worshipers near a mosque, mainly in Shia neighborhoods. A bombing at a football field on June 30 killed 12 people, mostly boys under 16. In another, on July 12, 10 people died when a car bomb explosion at a Shia funeral in Moqdadeya, west of Baghdad, was followed by a suicide bomber’s attack on emergency services workers going to assist the first set of casualties. Other attacks have targeted cafes in a busy Shia neighborhood of Baghdad, government security installations, and both Sunni and Shia mosques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other armed groups, including Shia militias, have also carried out numerous suicide and car bomb attacks, as well as targeted assassinations. Residents of Moqdadeya town told Human Rights Watch that umat least 100 families fled their homes after the Shia militia group Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq distributed flyers threatening to kill Sunni residents who failed to vacate the area. One local man told Human Rights Watch that he believed that the militia group had issued the threats in reprisal for the attack on the funeral procession. Neither Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq nor Iraqi Hezbollah, another Shia militia, have claimed responsibility for attacks, but the threatening flyers, which Human Rights Watch saw, clearly bear the logo of Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq. A third Shia militia, the Moqtar Army, has claimed responsibility for several recent attacks, including repeated attacks on Camp Liberty, where members of an Iranian dissident group are currently accommodated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Crimes against humanity are crimes of universal jurisdiction, meaning that those responsible, including those complicit in such crimes, can be prosecuted anywhere in the world. As a matter of customary international law, the term “crimes against humanity” includes a range of serious human rights abuses, including murder, committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack by a government or organized non-state group against a civilian population.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who commit crimes against humanity, order, or are otherwise complicit, should be held individually criminally responsible for their actions, Human Rights Watch said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iraqi authorities’ failure to hold anyone accountable for security force violence against Sunni protesters, their widespread use of torture to extract confessions from detainees, regardless of their sect, and the courts’ reliance on secret informant testimony that the defense cannot see and coerced confessions to issue arrest warrants and obtain convictions may constitute a failure to take the necessary steps to prevent and prosecute crimes against humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iraqi authorities need to take all possible measures to protect the right to life through ending these attacks. They should identify, arrest, and prosecute those responsible, and others complicit in assisting the attacks. To do that, Iraqi authorities should undertake urgently needed criminal justice reforms, including revising the Draconian anti-terror law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iraqi authorities should also repeal criminal procedure code articles that allow the use of secret informant testimony and coerced confessions that taint court proceedings. Judges and security officials should base convictions on evidence, not on confessions, which may be coerced. The government should put into effect a zero-tolerance policy for bribery, which permeates much of the justice system, ranging from detention officials who seek bribes to release detainees to security forces who bribe judges for false or after-the-fact arrest warrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past 12 months, Human Rights Watch has spoken to at least 20 current and former detainees who allege that police, army, or other security forces that answer directly to Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki held them in prolonged incommunicado detention due to corrupt relations between those holding them and judges who issue detention orders or to coerce them to confess. Some detainees’ families told Human Rights Watch that security forces demanded sums of over US$6,000 to release their relatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the prison breakout on July 21, reports from members of parliament and local activists suggest that the security forces have carried out mass arrests in the Sunni areas, to which they believe the escapees have fled. A member of the parliament’s security and defense committee told Human Rights Watch that Abu Ghraib and Tajji residents told him that security forces had conducted numerous mass arrest operations in these areas, detaining several of their family members at a time, but that he had been unable to verify them because of a security forces clampdown in the areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "A Ramadi lawyer told Human Rights Watch that, according to Anbar residents, the security forces had arrested “entire families” of escaped prisoners to coerce the escapees to surrender. The two prisons remain “on lockdown,” Ali Shubbar, a member of the parliament’s Human Rights Committee, told local media. He said that he and other members of an official investigation into the prisoner escapes and allegations that guards shot prisoners during the attack could not yet visit either prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the current climate, attacks are committed by all sides – Sunni insurgent groups, Shia militias, and government security forces – and each invokes the others’ violence as a justification for their own,” Stork said. “Rather than responding with increased brutality and resorting to torture, forced confessions, mass arrests, and unfair trials, the government needs to take the lead to end this brutal cycle.”\n",

      "\n",
      "In your recent remarks to the Annual Meeting of the President’s Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, you noted that Cambodian men are trafficked to sea to become slaves aboard fishing vessels. As a group of human rights and labor organizations concerned with this issue, we were pleased to see you address it in your remarks. We write today to ask that you ensure the U.S. Department of State takes the next step to putting an end to this practice and downgrade Thailand, whose labor and immigration policies allow trafficking to flourish in the seafood industry and others, to Tier III in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government of Thailand does not meet the minimum standards of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, nor is it taking real steps to meet those standards. Thailand was placed on the Tier II watch list in the 2013 Trafficking in Persons Report, which documented the Thai Government’s failure to “adequately regulate brokers, reduce the high costs associated with registration, or allow registered migrants to change employers.” The 2013 TIP Report review of Thailand also cited “pervasive trafficking-related corruption and weak interagency coordination” that “continued to impede progress in combating trafficking” in its assessment of the Government’s efforts to combat human trafficking. Nothing about this system has changed significantly in the course of the last year, and the government continues to be at best complacent, at worst complicit, in the trafficking of migrant workers from neighboring countries to provide inexpensive labor for export industries.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of 2013, there were an estimated 3-4 million migrant workers in Thailand, around 2 million of whom were legally registered to work. The majority of these workers, 80 percent, came from Burma to work in the most dangerous, dirty jobs, including manufacturing, seafood harvesting and processing, and domestic work. Of these, trafficking in Thailand’s seafood industry has gotten the most attention from international observers, and the most engagement from the Thai Government. The Thai Government is engaged with the International Labor Organization (ILO) in a program to clean up the industry, yet the ILO issued a report in 2013 indicating that, “the implementation of policies for prevention and suppression of forced labor and trafficking in the fishing sector remain insufficient.” The Thai Government’s participation with the ILO alone is not sufficient to address human trafficking, particularly while the Government refuses to heed ILO recommendations for legal reform and enhanced enforcement practices that would reduce the financial incentive for trafficking to continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "A report by Reuters in December 2013 exposed Thai government officials profiting from human trafficking when it uncovered they had sold Rohingya refugees to human traffickers. As many as 70,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled ethnic violence in Burma, many of them trying to reach Malaysia. Thailand is often a transit country for Rohingya Muslims. The Thai government detained more than 2,000 of them in what was called a “temporary protection” regimen between January and October 2013, with men and in some cases boys sent to extremely cramped and over-crowded immigration detention centers; women, girls and younger children were sent to government-run shelters. Finally, starting in October 2013, many Rohingya in detention were told they were being sent back to Burma via the town of Ranong, and asked to sign consent forms in Thai that they could not read to assent to the return. But instead, Thai authorities sold at least some of them to human traffickers. The refugees were held for ransom in jungle camps with armed guards, and beaten if their friends or relatives could not pay. Some who could not pay were apparently sold to fishing boats, and traffickers killed those who tried to escape. Only 154 Rohingya remained in Thai government detention at the end of 2013. Thai authorities implicated in these schemes have not faced serious investigation or prosecution. The Thai Government has, however, brought criminal defamation charges against two journalists who covered the story. The latest reports indicate as many as 40,000 Rohingya, including those who had been detained by Thai officials as described above, may have been trafficked through jungle camps in this manner. The Thai Government, however, refuses to identify the Rohingya as trafficking victims.\n",
      "\n",
      "To truly make sufficient progress in addressing human trafficking, the Thai Government should implement the reforms that have been repeatedly recommended by the U.S. State Department, other governments, NGOs and international bodies in several key areas, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "Improving victim identification and protection: The Thai Government reports identifying significantly more Thai nationals as victims of trafficking than other nationalities, though research indicates migrants are more likely to be trafficking victims. Labor inspectors frequently do not bring translators when conducting inspections, relying on the information they receive from Thai-speaking managers, do not know what signs to look for to identify human trafficking, and misclassify trafficking victims as illegal migrants to be deported.\n",

Fighting corruption: Instances of gross abuse by government officials against migrant workers continue to be common. Owners of factories or boats frequently bribe police to allow human trafficking to continue, migrant workers are frequently victims of shakedowns and deportation threats by police, and some trafficking victims have even reported being forced to work for Thai officials while being held in custody after being identified as victims of human trafficking.\n",

Reforming immigration policies : A complicated, expensive registration process that requires nationality verification and lack of a refugee law leaves stateless people (mostly Rohingya from Burma), migrant workers, and refugees at the mercy of labor recruiters to arrange for the documents they need to live in Thailand legally. Even through the official state process, brokers are not licensed or regulated, workers are responsible for paying the majority of the registration costs, and there is no state mechanism through which to apply for asylum outside the camps on the Thai-Burma border. Thus, many workers find themselves in some form of debt bondage to brokers. Additionally, tight limits on how long documents remain valid and continually shifting rules leave many workers who went through the legal process with expired documents through no fault of their own. This is an urgent concern as registration has expired for more than 250,000 workers who often paid several times more than the official rate to register under the National Verification System four years ago. As their documents expire, and official directives of how they must renew them remain in flux, more and more migrant workers are going to find themselves in the country illegally and more vulnerable to trafficking.\n",

As their documents expire, and official directives of how they must renew them remain in flux, more and more migrant workers are going to find themselves in the country illegally and more vulnerable to trafficking. Revising labor laws: Migrant workers cannot apply for work permits themselves. Their employer must apply on their behalf, and the permit binds the worker to that employer. Changing employers is very difficult, even if employers violate labor laws, and workers often face physical abuse and other forms of retaliation if employers find out they complained to the authorities to seek better treatment or to transfer to another employer. Work permits are tied to registration documents, so even legally registered workers wanting to leave an employer could face immediate deportation for doing so. The government has continually failed to amend the Labor Relations Act 1975 by which non-Thai nationals are also forbidden from forming or serving in the leadership of labor unions, denying migrant workers the ability to organize to protect themselves from abuses and enabling trafficking to continue even in formal work settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "We understand that Thailand is an important ally of the United States, and that you have a number of bilateral issues to consider. However, the United States should make very clear its concern about the systematic abuse of migrant workers in Thailand, who produce products destined for the U.S. market. If Thailand is allowed to continue its practice of undertaking cosmetic efforts at addressing the issue of human trafficking while ignoring or even encouraging the root causes of the problem, it will continue to get worse. The United States should evaluate the Government of Thailand rigorously and hold it accountable to the standards laid out in the TVPRA by moving Thailand to Tier III in the 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report. Far from making credible efforts to fight trafficking, the Thai government has perpetuated policies that foster trafficking of migrant workers within its borders and deny them access to protection and redress.\n",

      " Australian filmmaker James Ricketson arrives at the Municipal Court of Phnom Penh, Cambodia August 23, 2018. Reuters/Samrang Pring\n",
      "\n",
      "Dear Foreign Minister,\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch writes to urge you to press the Cambodian government to quash the conviction and immediately release imprisoned Australian journalist and filmmaker James Ricketson. We ask you to publicly denounce his trial and six-year sentence for what it is: farcical legal proceedings on bogus espionage charges. The muted response thus far by the Australian government to Ricketson’s conviction follows what had been more than a year of wholly ineffectual “quiet diplomacy” pursued by previous Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Australia’s “quietly, softly” approach to human rights diplomacy in Southeast Asia seems to have made it easier for Cambodia’s government to ignore “soft messages” from Australia and confidently jail an Australian citizen without a credible basis for 14 months without fear of repercussions. During the seven-day criminal trial that ended on August 31, no evidence was produced that demonstrated Ricketson had committed espionage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Australia has yet to condemn a prosecution widely seen as a politically motivated attempt by the Cambodian government of Prime Minister Hun Sen to silence independent journalists in the country ahead of the discredited election on July 29.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 3, 2017, police arrested Ricketson in Phnom Penh without informing him of the reasons for his arrest. He was held at the immigration police headquarters without charge for four nights, beyond the legal period of 72 hours. On June 9, an investigating judge charged him with espionage and sent him to pre-trial detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day before his arrest, Ricketson had flown a drone without a permit over an opposition rally in the capital. However, the case quickly surpassed any legal violation from the use of a drone. Ricketson had long been vocal about corruption and poverty in Cambodia, and the Cambodian government’s involvement. He also had produced several documentaries about the main political opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), and was in contact with its leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "On November 16, 2017, the Supreme Court arbitrarily dissolved the CNRP, effectively turning the upcoming election into a one-party contest. That court judgment mentioned Ricketson as one of the key players in fomenting a so-called “color revolution,” which the government had alleged without credible evidence was led by the CNRP, supported by civil society, and financially assisted by foreign governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Cambodian criminal law, espionage is defined as the collection by a foreigner of information that undermines the national defense. The crime requires the suspect to have obtained such information with the intent to share it with another country. The court never made such a finding, prompting Ricketson to ask during the proceedings: “Please, tell me, which county was I spying for?”\n",
      "\n",
      "The prosecution’s entire case rested on three pieces of evidence from Ricketson’s emails that demonstrated no crime, let alone espionage: a letter to then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull critical of the Cambodian government, an email to former Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy regarding an arrest warrant and another containing detail of Hun Sen’s personal bodyguard unit, and a dozen photographs of riot police at an opposition protest in Freedom Park in Phnom Penh. Given the government’s control over the courts in Cambodia, particularly in political cases, a conviction was a foregone conclusion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hours after the verdict, Australia’s new Prime Minister Scott Morrison told the media that it was best “to deal with these things calmly, directly and in a way that best assists the citizen,” but said nothing about the charges or the conduct of the proceedings.\n",
      "\n",
      "That day, you “acknowledged” the conviction, and stated that, “Ricketson is subject to legal proceedings under Cambodian law and must now consider his response to the court’s decision using the avenues open to him under Cambodian law.” You added, “the [Australian] government continues to provide full consular assistance” and “will consider what further appropriate support we can provide during that time.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This weak response sends a message to the Cambodian government that Australia does not intend to support its citizen against an outrageous prosecution before a politicized legal system in violation of his basic rights. We urge you to strongly, publicly and persistently condemn Ricketson’s trial and imprisonment and seek his immediate release. The horrendous conditions inside Cambodia’s prisons makes it critical that Australia’s consular officials ensure that Ricketson has adequate food and medical care for however long he is incarcerated. And you should make clear that Australia-Cambodia relations cannot be “business as usual” so long as he is unjustly imprisoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "More broadly, Australia’s failure to press the Cambodian government on this case sends a message to abusive governments everywhere that Australian citizens can be used for political purposes without repercussion. This ultimately puts all Australians abroad at risk. If there was a clear case for Australia to send a contrary message – one of support for its citizens abroad – the James Ricketson case is it.\n",

      "Killings and enforced disappearances have continued since Aquino took office. Despite strong evidence of military involvement in several cases, police investigations have stalled, the military persists in making blanket denials, and arrest warrants against alleged perpetrators have not been executed, Human Rights Watch said. Aquino continues to defend the use of poorly trained and supervised paramilitary forces, which have long been implicated in serious abuses to fight New People's Army insurgents and Islamist armed groups, in spite of their ongoing misuse as \"private armies\" of politicians and other power brokers.\n",

      "(New York) – Vietnam is using vague national security laws to stifle dissent and arrest critics, Human Rights Watch said today. The United States and other signatories to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) should press Vietnam to drop proposed legislation that would add even more rights-abusing penalties to its already draconian criminal code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Click to expand Image Vietnam's Public Security Minister General Tran Dai Quang at the National Convention Center in Hanoi on August 18, 2015. © 2015 Reuters\n",
      "\n",
      "In November 2015, the public security minister, General Tran Dai Quang, reported to the National Assembly that from June 2012 until November 2015, “The police have received, arrested, and dealt with 1,410 cases involving 2,680 people who violated national security.” He said, “During this same period, opposition persons have illegally established more than 60 groups and organizations in the name of democracy and human rights, which have about 350 participants from 50 cities and provinces.”“The Vietnam government’s announcement of thousands of arrests, while admitting that it is targeting democracy and human rights groups, is deeply troubling,” said Brad Adams , Asia director. “This suggests the government is massively overusing the country’s repressive national security laws to criminalize peaceful expression and persecute critics.”Vietnam’s National Assembly is considering a revised penal code and code of criminal procedure at its current session, which will close on November 28. The proposed amendments appear to be aimed at activists and critics. Instead of repealing its draconian laws, the government has proposed even harsher punishments for bloggers and rights activists.Vietnam has a continuing record of detaining people for long periods for alleged national security violations, without access to legal counsel or family visits, and with inadequate medical care. The status of each of the 2,680 people Gen. Quang mentioned should be clarified as soon as possible. The Vietnamese government should release information on each of these cases, including the person’s name; the charges filed, if any; whether the person has been convicted; the amount of time each person was or has been held in custody; and other relevant details.Vietnam frequently uses vaguely worded and loosely interpreted provisions in its penal code and other laws to imprison peaceful political and religious dissidents. These include “activities aiming to overthrow the people’s administration” (penal code article 79, penalty up to death sentence); “undermining national unity policy” (article 87, penalty up to 15 years in prison); “conducting propaganda against the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam” (article 88, penalty up to 20 years); “disrupting security” (article 89, penalty up to 15 years); “fleeing abroad or stay abroad to oppose the people’s government” (article 91, penalty up to life sentence); and “supplemental punishment” which strips former prisoners convicted of “national security” crimes of certain rights, puts them on probation for up to five years, and allows confiscation of part or all of their property (article 92).\n",
      "\n",
      "Current laws are bad enough and often used arbitrarily by the government to silence critics. But to imprison someone for up to five years just because the government thinks they may speak out or organize dissent is simply absurd. Brad Adams Asia director\n",
      "\n",
      "Vietnam also uses other articles in the penal code to target peaceful dissent, including “abusing rights to democracy and freedom to infringe upon the interests of the State and the legitimate rights and interests of organizations and citizens” (article 258), “causing public disorder” (article 245), and charges such as tax evasion.Among the harsher provisions proposed are new clauses in article 109 (originally article 79), article 117 (originally article 88), and article 118 (originally article 89), which has a new clause that states, “The person who takes actions in preparation of committing this crime shall be subject to between one and five years of imprisonment.”“Current laws are bad enough and often used arbitrarily by the government to silence critics,” Adams said. “But to imprison someone for up to five years just because the government thinks they may speak out or organize dissent is simply absurd.”During 2014 and 2015, in the midst of negotiations over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Vietnam released 14 bloggers and activists under pressure from the US. However, others remain in police custody, some of whom have not been put on trial. Those serving sentences include the bloggers Tran Huynh Duy Thuc Father Nguyen Van Ly ; the musicians Tran Vu Anh Binh and Vo Minh Tri ; the rights activists Dang Xuan Dieu, Ho Duc Hoa, and Nguyen Dang Minh Man ; and the land rights activist Ho Thi Bich Khuong . Others who have not been put on trial include the bloggers Nguyen Huu Vinh (known as Anh Ba Sam), Nguyen Thi Minh Thuy , and Nguyen Dinh Ngoc (known as Nguyen Ngoc Gia), who were arrested in 2014.With the spotlight on labor rights, in June 2014 Vietnam released labor activist Do Thi Minh Hanh , who was arrested and charged in 2010 under article 89 for helping organize a wildcat strike. Hanh’s fellow activists Nguyen Hoang Quoc Hung and Doan Huy Chuong remain behind bars. If the revised penal code is passed, Hanh, Hung, and Chuong could be arrested simply on the basis of the authorities’ worry that they might help organize strikes.According to Gen. Quang’s report, the police have “timely prevented activities of opposition persons in the country who stirred and agitated the people to gather, march, and protest against the Party and the State. [The police] have actively attacked against [opposition groups] in the political realm and divided and isolated leading figures in order to prevent them from gathering forces in the form of ‘civil social organizations.’” Gen. Quang insisted that the tasks for the police include “preventing any plan to form and publicize domestic opposition political organizations, as well as activities that form and publicize illegal groups and organizations on the Internet.”“It appears that the Vietnamese government played nice during TPP negotiations, but now that the agreement has been signed it is taking steps to tighten government control over critics,” Adams said.\n",

The case was based on his comments on Facebook encouraging people to join a street protest over the killing of a would-be migrant by Morocco’s Coast Guard.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Soufian al-Nguad did nothing but express his anger and urge protests over the killing of an innocent woman,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The charges against him are illegitimate, and he should be freed immediately.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 25, 2018, the Moroccan Coast Guard fired on a boat in the Mediterranean, killing Hayat Belkacem, 20, a student, and wounding three other passengers, as they tried to migrate to Europe. Morocco’s state news agency said that the Coast Guard opened fire after the boat acted “suspiciously” in Moroccan waters and the pilot disobeyed their orders. Authorities said they would investigate the killing but have not disclosed any findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 27, al-Nguad criticized on Facebook the silence of Moroccan political parties after Belkacem’s killing, praised Tetouan’s “ultra” soccer fans who called for a black-clad protest in remembrance of the slain student, and encouraged people to join the protest. Six days later, police arrested and interrogated al-Nguad, whom Tetouan’s prosecutor charged with disobedience, incitement to disobedience, spreading hate, and insulting Morocco’s flag and symbols.\n",
      "\n",
      "In its written judgment, the court held that al-Nguad “confessed that he was [the author] of the [Facebook] post calling for public protests, in which he participated, wearing black alongside other black-clad protesters, despite his previous knowledge that demonstrations require authorizations to be delivered by competent authorities.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment also says that al-Nguad wrote in another Facebook post: “Congratulations to the noble royal Coast Guard, who killed Hayat while she was trying to emigrate clandestinely to flee the government, the corruption, and the kingdom of Morocco.” The tribunal found that this post included “expressions inciting to hate and to calls for violence,” and that the usage of the word “kingdom” in such a context was “a core insult to the country’s flag and symbols.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch reviewed the Facebook posts over which al-Nguad was indicted, and found nothing in them that supported the charges against him. He was imprisoned merely for criticizing the government and urging others to protest, speech protected by international human rights law, Human Rights Watch said. Moroccan law should not criminalize such acts. And as long as laws remain on the books that make such charges possible, authorities should refrain from bringing them.\n",
      "\n",

      "Dear President Obama,\n",
      "\n",
      "We write to urge you to raise a number of critical human rights concerns with Prime Minister Hayder al-Abadi, both in private meetings and in any public comments related to his visit to Washington later this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "As you know, Human Rights Watch and others have documented numerous horrific abuses by the extremist group Islamic State (ISIS) and by Iraqi security forces and sectarian militias that have assumed a major role in the government’s fight against ISIS. As militias and government forces have advanced in recent months, violations of the laws of war and other abuses by these forces have increased. in the area around Amerli and more recently in and around Tikrit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent comments from a range of senior US officials expressing concern about these abuses and their implications for Iraq’s long-term security are very important, but such criticism is undermined by the US’s policy of providing unfettered military aid to the government of Iraq.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their enhanced role, the sectarian militias have carried out abductions; summary executions, including beheadings; torture and other ill-treatment; and forcible displacements of thousands of families in areas recaptured from ISIS. We are concerned by recent statements from Prime Minister Abadi that appear to walk back from – or negate – earlier commitments to address accountability for these serious abuses both by reining in the militias and taking steps to deal with its own forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance, the appointment of a member of the abusive Badr militia as interior minister and another Badr member as human rights minister reflects an inability or unwillingness on the part of the al-Abadi government to rein in militias, despite their history of atrocities. The government also failed to protect civilians in the area around Amerli after Iraqi government forces and affiliated militias recaptured it from ISIS last September, with the assistance of US air strikes, and reports from Tikrit indicate that similar abuses recurred there as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The increased influence of militias on Iraqi military operations has led to an escalating crackdown on local and international media, which runs counter to Prime Minister al-Abadi’s pledges to enhance media protections. Recently the prime minister has backtracked on earlier statements that he intended to hold militia leaders accountable and protect press freedoms. The prime minister’s inability or unwillingness to make good on his pledges to hold militia members accountable for grave abuses has reinforced the prevailing climate of impunity, further empowering militias to intimidate their critics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iraqi government’s failure to enact key reforms relating to the country’s desperately corrupt and inept criminal justice system has allowed state security forces to enjoy complete impunity for serious rights violations alongside impunity for government officials within state institutions—some of which the US had a role in setting up, such as the Integrity Commission and Inspectors General in the Interior and Defense Ministries. The deeply problematic Anti-Terrorism Law remains in place, leaving suspects in criminal trials with little or no access to an adequate defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iraq faces serious security challenges but these are being exacerbated by the government’s failure to adopt a range of urgently needed reforms. This has undercut security for all Iraqis. Since ISIS took control of Mosul in June 2014, the expanded fighting and widespread abuses by ISIS and by government forces and militias have brought the number of internally displaced Iraqis to almost two million. Tens of thousands have no basic services, lack adequate food and shelter, and remain vulnerable to attack by ISIS and militias.\n",
      "\n",
      "Iraqi government officials and members of the security forces as well as ordinary Iraqis have told Human Rights Watch that they believe the tactical gains that US air strikes have achieved against ISIS have been badly undermined by the abuses of security forces and militias. By providing effectively unrestricted military assistance to Iraq despite increasing militia abuses, the US sends a message – despite public statements to the contrary – that they are not of serious concern.\n",
      "\n",

      "With thousands of people fleeing Aleppo toward the Turkish border and talk of the European Union’s future at stake, Europe’s debate on the refugee crisis is taking on an air of desperation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many inside and outside the Netherlands have seized upon a plan by the Dutch Labor leader Diederik Samsom to return all asylum seekers to Turkey from Greece in exchange for the voluntary resettlement of 150,000 to 250,000 refugees from Turkey to the EU. While the plan has some positive aspects, other elements raise serious human rights concerns. Equally important, it does nothing to move forward the vital EU plan to share responsibility for asylum seekers among EU states.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasing refugee resettlement from Turkey is worth pursuing. Making enough places available could offer a credible alternative to smugglers and deadly boat crossings. Increased EU action could help encourage rich countries elsewhere in the world to pitch in. But that will be a challenge given the EU’s paltry record of resettlement admissions. By mid-January, fewer than 800 people had been brought to Europe to carry out a 2015 commitment by EU governments to relocate 22,500 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Resettlement offers should not require a trade-off, though, against the right to spontaneously seek asylum in Europe. To do so would risk moving Europe toward an Australia-style system that has led to horrific abuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Responding to criticism of the plan, Samsom said that for Greece to return people to Turkey, it would first need to meet EU standards as a “safe third country,” a designation he acknowledges is not yet merited. That designation would make it lawful under EU law to send back asylum seekers who are not Turkish to Turkey without determining their asylum claims in the EU. The European Commission hinted that it could support the plan but the Turkish government has flatly rejected it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to improve Turkey’s capacity to fairly process and humanely host asylum seekers are sensible but will take time. Turkey is struggling with 2.5 million Syrian refugees. While it grants them temporary protection, they are not entitled to refugee status. Other refugees, including Iranians, Iraqis and Afghans, have even less legal protection. While Turkey is bound by the Refugee Convention, it retains an exception that excludes from protection anyone not originally from Europe. And it has a track record of deporting Syrians in violation of international law. By these measures it fails the EU test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turkey deserves credit for taking some steps to make life easier for Syrians, notably by agreeing in early 2016 to let many apply for work permits. But Syrians and others still face huge problems accessing education, health and other services. The 3 billion Euro in aid tied to the controversial EU-Turkey migration deal could help improve life for Syrians and others in Turkey if targeted effectively, but that won’t happen overnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its aims, the EU-Turkey deal has yet to have much impact on departures to Greece across the Aegean, a journey 850,000 people made last year and 68,000 since January. But with its border with Syria already effectively closed, Turkey has made it even harder for people to enter the country from Syria, leading Lebanon to deport at least 200 Syrians being to Damascus in January. Turkey announced new visa restrictions for Iraqis in early February.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, despite its generous hosting of Syrians, Turkey won’t be a safe country of asylum any time soon. Acting as though it can be made safe by declaring it so, as some European politicians, including Greece’s interior minister, seem to think, is a dangerous illusion. It’s also why the Samsom Plan is not the right way forward.\n",

      "The Dutch presidency of the EU Council is an opportunity to show the way toward resolving the crisis. That means ramping up resettlement without strings and addressing the chaos inside European borders with a properly functioning common EU asylum system and shared responsibility across all member states. The Dutch presidency has committed to push for implementation of the faltering EU plan to relocate 160,000 asylum seekers from overburdened Greece and Italy, yet it has relocated only 50 people. Resettlement and relocation. That’s the plan the Netherlands and Europe should back.\n",

      "(Washington, DC) - Equatorial Guinea's government has spent lavishly on diplomatic accommodations while neglecting the rights of the country's poor in the lead-up to hosting the African Union summit, Human Rights Watch and EG Justice said today. The government has also sharply limited public dissent and critical reporting. While most citizens of Equatorial Guinea languish in poverty, President Teodoro Obiang's government, which holds the revolving AU chairmanship, spent more than US$830 million to construct a luxury complex for the summit outside the nation's capital, Malabo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The Obiang government hopes that foreign visitors will be favorably impressed by the deluxe facilities built for their enjoyment,\" said Tutu Alicante, executive director of EG Justice, an organization based in Washington, DC. \"But visitors should instead question why the government is building villas for the rich while Equatorial Guinea's poor live in slums without reliable electricity or drinking water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The theme of the AU Summit, which runs from June 23 to July 1, 2011, is \"Accelerating Youth Empowerment for Sustainable Development.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Oil revenues make the country's per-capita wealth in 2010 equivalent to that of Germany, Japan, or the United Kingdom, but living standards are very poor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current statistics are hard to obtain for the country, which does not always produce reliable data. More than three-quarters of the country's people live in poverty, according to a 2007 study by the government of Equatorial Guinea, whose findings the government has cited as recently as 2009 but now disputes. Equatorial Guinea's child mortality rates have declined somewhat, in line with global trends, but 2009 UNICEF figures indicate that the country ranks the 14th worst in the world on this indicator. The government has not produced updated figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Obiang government has at times denied that poverty is a serious problem, while on other occasions it has recognized the need to improve social welfare. It recently dismissed as \"absurd\" outside criticisms about extreme poverty in the country, stating that Equatoguineans \"now enjoy a status envied around the world.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2007, it adopted a long-term development plan that largely focuses on infrastructure but also calls for social improvements. Social spending levels have increased, compared with spending in past years. But overall allocations to meet social needs remain relatively low in light of available funds, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "Education spending as a percentage of GDP is lower in Equatorial Guinea than in neighboring countries, including Cameroon and Gabon, despite the fact that Equatorial Guinea is the wealthiest nation in sub-Saharan Africa on a per-capita basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Education spending was approximately $200 million in 2008, the most recent year for which the figure could be calculated. That sum is less than one-quarter of the government's expenditures on building the complex to host the AU summit.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is difficult for citizens of Equatorial Guinea to challenge the government's spending choices from inside the country, given the lack of press freedom and crackdowns on those who criticize the government or try to mobilize to defend their rights, EG Justice and Human Rights Watch said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Malabo event, unlike other AU summits, will not include a parallel civil society gathering for foreign and domestic groups. No public explanation has been offered.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government has said that it is \"reinforcing surveillance\" to ensure \"perfect security\" for the meeting. It closed schools a month early in what may be a measure designed to deter youth protests. Earlier in the year, it banned public demonstrations. Opposition groups and human rights monitors have reported incidents in which political activists, students, and migrants were detained between April and June. United Nations experts and others have documented serious and widespread abuses by Equatorial Guinea's security forces, including systematic use of torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both domestic and international journalists have faced obstacles in reporting freely. Some foreign journalists have been denied visas, while others who have worked in the country report being under surveillance, harassed, and detained.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, on June 11, Equatorial Guinea security agents expelled journalists from the German television network ZDF after interrogating them for several hours and deleting footage the agents felt showed the country in an unfavorable light, including images of poverty. In April 2010, the sole foreign correspondent in Equatorial Guinea, an Agence France-Presse reporter, was detained and held for several hours while attempting to cover the arrival of foreign dignitaries for a summit meeting.\n",

      "The new complex built for the summit, called Sipopo, is about five kilometers outside of Malabo. A June 10 government announcement says it features a high-end hotel with the country's first spa, part of the Sofitel chain, a major new conference center, a mile-long artificial beach, 52 luxury beach-front villas (at a cost of $140 million), an 18-hole golf course, a new highway, a heliport, an ultra-modern hospital, a fiber optics network, and a police station. The Obiang government has said that it hopes Sipopo will serve as a destination for foreign tourists after the weeklong summit concludes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has noted the relatively low social spending in Equatorial Guinea in light of needs, and expressed concern about skyrocketing spending on infrastructure. It warned in a May 2010 report that the level of public spending is unsustainable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IMF also expressed concern about high poverty in the country and urged the government to make projects that \"raise living standards and productivity\" their priority.\n",

      "Equatorial Guinea's government, for its part, has argued that spending to build facilities for the AU summit would boost tourism prospects and the economy. The country will also co-host next year's African Cup of Nations, from January 21 to February 12, 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Equatorial Guinea has tremendous resources at its disposal that should be spent to benefit the population,\" said Daniel Bekele, Africa director at Human Rights Watch. \"The stark contrast between the luxury facilities for the summit and the poor state of education, health, and civil rights for too many of the country's young people should make the international community question the government's priorities.\"\n",

      "With its decision to bring Chinese dissident Wang Dan to trial on October 30 on the charge of “conspiracy to subvert the government,” the most serious charge in the Chinese criminal code, the Chinese government has signaled its determination to deny freedom of speech and association to any citizen daring publicly to raise fundamental criticisms of government policy. The charge sends a message to China’s dissidents that the courts will no longer draw a distinction between political speech or writing on the one hand and concrete action on the other: both levels of dissent are henceforth to be indiscriminately treated as “endangering state security.” It casts serious doubt on the commitment of top Chinese officials to the vaunted reform of the country’s legal system. And it shows conclusively that Western mantras about economic growth producing political liberalization notwithstanding, Chinese leaders are growing increasingly intolerant of dissent. In addition, by holding Wang Dan’s trial just weeks before the visit to Beijing of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and just weeks after visits of German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, Beijing has chosen to disregard international expressions of concern over its human rights record.\n",

      "\n",
      "We are writing to you before the December 31 announced closure of Camp Ashraf (also known as Camp New Iraq) to urge the government of Sweden to take proactive steps to help prevent the stand-off between the Iraqi government and the leadership of the Mohjahedin-e Khalq (MEK) from deteriorating further at a critical moment in Iraq’s precarious transition to democratic rule.\n",
      "\n",
      "A demonstration of concrete support by the Swedish government for UN initiatives could help to avert a confrontation that could become even more violent than the two previous clashes that have already occurred at Camp Ashraf leading to loss of life on both April 8, 2011 and July 29, 2009, and to help the UN to navigate a resolution to the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 5, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called on UN member states to indicate their willingness to accept Camp Ashraf residents for resettlement and on December 6 the UN envoy to Iraq, Martin Kobler, called upon the Iraqi government to extend the December 31 deadline for closing the camp\n",
      "\n",
      "We urge you to support both calls publicly. However, if the Government of Iraq insists on keeping the December 31 deadline for closing the camp, we also call on you to engage Swedish diplomats in Iraq in coordination with the UN and other diplomatic missions in Iraq to monitor the situation at Camp Ashraf, particularly near and at the time of the deadline, and during any transfer of its residents to other locations in order to try to prevent serious human rights abuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also recommend strong Swedish diplomatic engagement with both the Iraqi government and the MEK leadership to convince each side to allow the UN to move camp residents to a protected location, under UN supervision and where the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will be able to screen camp residents privately and individually to determine possible refugee claims or grounds for exclusion from refugee status.\n",
      "\n",
      "While recognizing that the Iraqi government may choose to close the camp, your engagement will be critically important to ensuring that this is done in a peaceful and orderly way. With respect to the Iraqi government, your intervention would help to ensure that the camp is closed in ways that respect the human rights of the former camp residents, including protecting them from refoulement to Iran, forcible return that could expose them to torture and persecution in Iran. With respect to the MEK leadership, your intervention would help to ensure that they allow camp residents the individual choice to leave the camp, whether or not the conditions of the MEK leadership have been met, and to make choices about their futures, including the individual choice of voluntary repatriation to Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch has previously documented abuses by the leadership of the Mojahedin-e Khalq in Camp Ashraf against camp residents, including prolonged incommunicado and solitary confinement, beatings, verbal and psychological abuse, coerced confessions, threats of execution, and torture. We believe there could be a substantial number of the more than 3,200 camp residents who have been held in the camp involuntarily, including people who were coerced to join or to remain with the MEK against their will. Our 2005 report, No Exit: Human Rights Abuses inside the MKO Camps , ( https://www.hrw.org/legacy/backgrounder/mena/iran0505/iran0505.pdf ) included accounts from former Camp Ashraf residents indicating that the camp leadership detained MEK members who requested to leave the organization in solitary, incommunicado confinement.\n",
      "\n",
      "With regard to the UN Secretary General’s appeal to UN member states to indicate their willingness to receive Camp Ashraf residents for resettlement, we take note of the fact that the European Union removed the Mojahedin-e Khalq from its list of terrorist organizations in 2009 and that there is no longer a generalized bar on the admission of MEK members to Sweden. While we recognize that some residents of the camp may not lodge refugee claims or may be excluded from refugee status, we also believe that many of the camp residents would face persecution in Iran so would qualify as refugees. If UNHCR is given the opportunity to conduct private and confidential interviews with individuals outside the camp it may determine this. We ask that you announce your willingness to consider resettling to Sweden persons that UNHCR individually recognizes as refugees and refers to you for resettlement, who do not fall under the Refugee Convention’s exclusion clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "We understand from a Wikileaks cable ( http://dazzlepod.com/cable/09BAGHDAD2698/ ) that 16 Camp Ashraf residents are Swedish passport holders. We would also ask that you publicly affirm that Swedish passport holders will be allowed to exercise any rights to enter Sweden that were previously granted, and that you also consider allowing their immediate family members to enter as a way to maintain the integrity of the families and contribute to the overall resettlement of Camp Ashraf residents. Entry into Sweden would be without prejudice to any pending extradition requests against them or to any criminal prosecution in Sweden.\n",
      "\n",
      "We urge you to announce to the Iraqi government, other governments, and the United Nations that Sweden will closely monitor the closing of Camp Ashraf, and will cooperate with the UN to facilitate the safe and orderly transfer of its former residents, including by considering admitting refugees that UNHCR asks Sweden to resettle. Such an announcement by the Swedish government would help greatly to break the impasse that threatens to result in human rights abuses at the end of this month if the camp is closed without provisions being made for the resettlement of its residents. Such a tangible demonstration of support would, at the same time, show international solidarity with Iraq during a time of fragile transition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your consideration of this matter. We would be happy to discuss it with you or your representatives in greater detail.\n",

This submission addresses articles 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 12, 14, 15, and 16 of the Convention.\n",

      "1. Discrimination against women in its Personal Status Law and other laws (CEDAW articles 1, 2, 11, 15, and 16)\n",
      "\n",
      "Qatar’s Family Law No. 22 of 2006 codified matters of personal status for the first time in Qatar; some of its provisions, particularly those relating to marriage and divorce, discriminate against women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of male guardianship incorporated in Qatari law undermines women’s right to make autonomous decisions about marriage. The law provides that women can only marry if a male guardian approves of the marriage while it allows men to have four wives at any one time.[1] The law requires a husband to provide “maintenance” for his wife during marriage.[2] The law also requires a wife to be obedient to her husband, maintain the house and its belongings, and breastfeed infant children unless there is an impediment. Under the law, a wife can lose her right to maintenance if, for example, she refuses to have sexual relations “without a legitimate reason” or works outside the home without her husband’s permission.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Men also have a unilateral right to divorce while requiring women to apply to the courts for divorce on limited grounds, such as if she has been abandoned or abused, or if her husband has failed to support her financially.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "The minimum age for registering a marriage is 16 for girls, in contravention with international standards that recommend a minimum age of marriage at 18.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "Women also face discrimination regarding the status of children after divorce. The law grants a father legal guardianship of the children regardless of whether a court has ordered that the children should live with the mother. The law expressly states that the Muslim mother shall have physical custody of children up to age 13 for boys and age 15 for girls, unless the court rules otherwise, but the law gives all decision-making authority to fathers.[6] A non-Muslim mother may only retain custody of the child until the age of seven.[7] Children can also be removed from living with their mothers if their mothers re-marry.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Under inheritance provisions, female siblings receive half the amount their brothers get.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "Single women under 25 years of age must obtain their guardian’s permission to travel outside Qatar. Married women are entitled to travel without permission irrespective of their age. However, if a man does not want his wife to travel, he can approach the competent court to prohibit her journey.[10] A wife can be deemed disobedient, and thus lose her husband’s financial support, if she travels despite his objection.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Discrimination against women in the Penal Code and other laws (CEDAW articles 1, 2, 5, and 15)\n",
      "\n",
      "Zina offenses (sex outside of marriage) that criminalize consensual sexual relations outside marriage and other “moral” offenses under Qatari law violate international human rights law, as do the punishments associated with them. Muslims convicted of zina can also be sentenced to flogging (if unmarried) or the death penalty (if married). Non-Muslims can be sentenced to imprisonment. Article 281 of the Penal Code, for example, stipulates that “whoever copulates with a female over sixteen without compulsion, duress or ruse shall be punished with imprisonment for a term up to seven years. The same penalty shall also be imposed on the female for her consent.” Article 282 increases the penalty to up to 15 years if either or both parties knew “that he is prohibited to marry her for permanent or temporary reasons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "According to one media report in 2017, a lawyer in Qatar estimated that every day he sees about two to three zina cases tried in court but hardly sees sentences being carried out. The lower courts usually issue severe punishments such as flogging and stoning, but most end up in the Court of Appeals which “almost always” lowers the sentence. In the case of flogging, a loophole about “not being medically fit to withstand” the lashes is used to exempt prisoners from the punishment, according to the lawyer. He did not know of any stoning sentence that has been carried out in recent years.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "Zina offenses are often applied in a way that discriminates on the basis of sex: women are disproportionately impacted due to prevailing social attitudes and because pregnancy serves as “evidence” of the offense. Women who have suffered rape or sexual assault face a risk that they will face zina charges if they report the crimes committed against them. Men can deny the act of zina, whereas women are less able to do so if they are found to have miscarried or are pregnant. Moreover, hospital staff members report women who have miscarried or are pregnant outside of marriage to the police. According to one media report from 2017, a Filipino domestic worker said she had been reported to the police by the hospital after she sought treatment for heavy bleeding and the hospital staff believed she had miscarried. She had spent a year in prison but had not yet been sentenced at the time of the report.[12]\n",

      "Zina offenses can also impact vulnerable women, such as migrant domestic workers, disproportionately. Some employers accuse domestic workers of zina to counter rape or sexual assault allegations that the worker has made against the employer. As domestic migrant workers live in their employer’s homes, they face the risk that employers will report them to the police if they suspect them of having a sexual relationship.\n",

      "There are 173,742 domestic workers, mostly from Asia or East Africa, including 107,621 women, according to Qatar’s 2016 labor force survey.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, Qatar adopted of Law No. 15 on Service Workers in the Home, which provides legal guarantees for domestic workers’ labor rights for the first time. While this is an advance, further steps are needed to ensure domestic workers’ rights are protected in accordance with international law.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestic workers law outlines new protections such as a maximum 10-hour workday, at least 24 consecutive hours of rest each week, three weeks of annual leave, and an end-of-service payment of at least three weeks per year. However, it still offers fewer protections than Law No.14 of 2004, the Labor Law, which applies to most other workers and provides for a maximum 8-hour workday and a 48-hour work week. The Labor Law also provides reduced working hours during Ramadan of a 6-hour working day and a 36-hour work week, but no similar provisions are made under the Domestic Workers Law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestic workers law has other gaps as well, and does not fully conform to the International Labour Organization (ILO) Domestic Workers Convention, the global treaty on domestic workers’ rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestic workers law stipulates that the working day be interspersed with rest breaks, but it does not count rest breaks as part of the 10 working hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the domestic workers law provides for daily rest periods and weekly rest days, it allows domestic workers to work during these times if agreed between them and their employer. Employers can easily exploit this loophole. The deep power imbalance between employers and domestic workers makes it extremely difficult for a worker to negotiate fair working conditions, claim their rights, or refuse an employer’s request.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike the Labor Law, the domestic workers law does not set a limit on additional working hours nor require overtime pay. The Domestic Workers Law prohibits employers from forcing domestic workers to work while on sick leave, but makes no provisions for sick leave itself, including whether it should be paid. The Labor Law provides two weeks of sick leave at full pay, four weeks at half pay, and unpaid leave thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestic workers law provides for daily rest and a weekly rest day, but it does not explicitly state that workers may leave the household during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The domestic workers law prohibits employers from deducting a worker’s pay to compensate for recruitment fees but does not prohibit agents from charging costs or fees, or taking a domestic worker’s salary to compensate any costs paid for the domestic workers’ recruitment. It also does not require employers or agents to reimburse a worker for recruitment fees already paid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In November 2017, Qatar announced a temporary minimum wage of QR750 (US$206) for migrant workers, but this does not combat the current discriminatory practice of wage differentials based on nationality of domestic workers. Qatar is in the process of setting a minimum wage with the support from the ILO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qatar’s kafala (sponsorship) system gives employers excessive control over domestic workers, including the power to deny them the right to leave the country or change jobs. Unless Qatar abolishes or significantly reforms this system, it will remain difficult for domestic workers to exercise their rights under the new law as they can be arrested and deported for “absconding” if they flee their employer’s home. Financial barriers can prevent domestic workers from pursuing claims of abuse, as the kafala system prevents them from working for another employer while a claim is being adjudicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Discrimination against women in Qatar’s 2005 Nationality Law (CEDAW articles 1 and 9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Qatar does not allow for dual nationality and discriminates against women by not allowing them to pass nationality to their children on the same basis as men. Law No. 38 of 2005 on the acquisition of Qatari nationality allows men to pass citizenship to their spouses and children, whereas children of Qatari women and non-citizen men who have lived in Qatar for more than 25 years can only apply for citizenship under narrow conditions.[17] However, the government has not consistently approved such applications. A 36-year-old man born in Qatar to a Qatari mother and Bahraini father told Human Rights Watch in June 2017 that he had applied for Qatari nationality six years earlier, but had never received notification of a decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discriminatory law has long plagued women and their families. After June 2017— when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt cut off relations with Qatar, expelled Qatari citizens and demanded their own citizens return—Qatari women with mixed Gulf nationality families suffered acutely. The political rift tore apart entire families stretched across the four countries.[18] Some Qatari women found that their children and spouses who did not have Qatari citizenship were required to return to their countries of nationality; Qatari women in the other countries were forced to return to Qatar and brought their non-citizen children with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2018, Qatar passed a law on permanent residency that would be available for the first time to children of Qatari women married to non-Qatari men. Under the new law, only up to 100 people per year can acquire permanent resident status for the first time. The law allows those who are granted permanent residency to receive government health and educational services, invest in the economy, and own real estate. The permanent residency law however, falls short of granting women equal rights to men in conferring nationality to their children and spouses.[19]\n",

      "\n",
      "The CEDAW committee in its 2014 concluding observations made a number of recommendations that have not been implemented, including calls on Qatar to repeal or modify without delay discriminatory legislation, including provisions in the Personal Status Law, the Nationality Law, and the Penal Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "We encourage the Committee to make the following recommendations to the Qatari government:\n",
      "\n",
      "Reform the Personal Status Law to provide women with equal rights in entering marriage, during marriage, and at its dissolution, including in all issues concerning children, inheritance, and property rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remove restrictions on women’s freedom to travel abroad including the requirement that women under 25 need male guardian permission and the right of men to apply to courts to prohibit their wives from travelling abroad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Increase the minimum age of marriage to 18, in line with CEDAW and CRC recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enact laws to make all forms of violence against women and girls, including domestic violence, a criminal offense. Explicitly criminalize marital rape. Ensure that legislative reform includes provisions for victim assistance such as protection orders, and appropriate protocols and guidelines for all government officials responding to violence against women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Decriminalize adult consensual sexual relations in private by amending article 281, 282, and other provisions in the Penal Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Align the new 2017 domestic workers law in line with the ILO Domestic Workers Convention, including by ensuring that domestic workers have equal rights to workers covered under the Labor Law including in relation to hours of work, overtime compensation, periods of daily and weekly rest, paid annual leave, and sick leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Require through further legislation, such as any implementing regulations, that employers allow domestic workers to leave the household during rest and leave periods, and that all hours during which workers are required to be on call should be calculated as part of their working day. It should also clarify that agents should not confiscate salaries of domestic workers or require employers to pay their salaries to them where the agency is not the worker’s direct employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure that domestic workers enjoy minimum wage coverage, including an hourly minimum wage, under law and that compensation does not discriminate based on sex, race, or national origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratify the ILO Domestic Workers Convention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enforce the 2017 domestic workers law, including by investigating and prosecuting allegations and complaints against employers and agents for violations.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "The risk the coronavirus pandemic poses to staff and inmates in Turkey’s vastly overcrowded prisons has prompted the government to accelerate a plan to substitute prison time with alternatives such as early parole and house arrest. While a welcome step, it is important that prisoners who are not serving time for acts of violence but instead are jailed for little more than their political views can benefit. There should be no discrimination on the basis of political opinion.\n",

      "The draft law before Parliament this week reportedly could help up to 100,000 prisoners out of a prison population in Turkey close to 300,000, but will exclude thousands of inmates on trial or sentenced for terrorism offenses or crimes against the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Terrorism may sound like the gravest of offenses, but in Turkey, the government misuses the charge for political ends. Many inmates are placed in lengthy pretrial detention or sentenced without evidence that they committed violent acts, incited violence, or provided logistical help to outlawed armed groups. Among them are journalists like Ahmet Altan, politicians like Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdağ, human rights defenders like Osman Kavala, and thousands of dismissed civil servants, teachers, and others punished for association with the Fethullah Gülen movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch has worked for years on the misuse of terrorism laws in Turkey, including how courts defined exercising the right to assembly as a terrorism offense, and how media, politicians, and lawyers have all been targeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government’s early parole draft law suggests prisoners who have served at least half their sentence could be released early and includes various provisions such as enabling pregnant women and prisoners over 60 with health conditions to be released to house arrest or on parole.\n",
      "\n",
      "All efforts to reduce the prison population at this time are welcome, but such measures cannot become a tool for targeting political prisoners. Parliament should reject any discriminatory exemption of terrorism prisoners and sick prisoners who have applied for postponement of sentences. It should make sure that decisions on early release of all prisoners are non-discriminatory – taking into consideration the imperative of protecting their health, particularly where there are risks due to age or underlying medical conditions – and objective, based on the risk prisoners may pose to others if released early.\n",

      "We are writing to you in advance of International Migrants Day, December 18, to draw your attention to the abuse and exploitation of workers from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Bangladesh in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries—Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, and Kuwait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch is an independent organization dedicated to promoting and protecting human rights in more than 90 countries. For 30 years, we have worked to bring greater justice and security to people around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been campaigning for the last decade for better protections for migrant workers in the Middle East. We have conducted in-depth investigations on exploitation of migrant workers, published numerous reports, and called upon labor-receiving countries to enforce policies that end labor and human rights abuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have also worked with labor-sending countries to ensure better protections for their nationals when they seek employment abroad. While some countries individually have made efforts to protect their nationals, Human Rights Watch would like to call upon the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to launch a regional protection initiative, so that member states can join forces to leverage their collective bargaining power and seek greater protections for their citizens in line with international labor and human rights standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Migrant labor contributes significantly to economic growth and development in each country. In Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, remittances from migrants are larger than the national foreign exchange reserves. Remittances formed 25 percent of Nepal’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012; in India, remittances are larger than the earnings from information technology (IT) exports. The World Bank estimates South Asian countries will receive US$114 billion in remittances in 2013; 48 percent of this will come from GCC countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abuses against Migrant Workers\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their valuable contributions, major gaps in protections leave migrant workers at risk of serious abuses without redress and in the worst cases can lead to forced labor and trafficking.\n",
      "\n",
      "In labor-sending countries, recruiters often deceive workers over the terms of their future employment and charge them exorbitant recruitment fees. Recruitment costs can be as high as $1200 for a Nepalese worker, amounting to six months of wages in the Gulf, while a Bangladeshi migrant may have to pay as much as $2900 in recruitment costs, amounting to 14 months of future wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "In labor-receiving countries in the Gulf, workers typically have their passports confiscated and are forced to work under the highly exploitative kafala system of sponsorship-based employment, which prevents them from leaving employers. Migrants often have limited information about their rights and channels to seek help, and face discrimination and obstacles to redress. They do not enjoy the protection of trade unions. Employers are rarely, if ever prosecuted, for violations of labor law. As a result migrant workers frequently experience hazardous working conditions, long hours, unpaid wages, and cramped and unsanitary housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent international attention has been on Qatar, where mostly South Asian low-wage migrant construction workers build under appalling conditions the infrastructure for the 2022 Football World Cup games, risking their lives. A June 2012 report by Human Rights Watch documented pervasive employer exploitation and abuse of workers in Qatar’s construction industry. Human Rights Watch has documented almost identical systems and similar problems in reports on Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investigations by the Guardian newspaper in London in September 2013 revealed that 44 Nepalese workers died between June and August this year, about half of them from heart failure or workplace accidents. This corresponds with Human Rights Watch findings published in June 2012, which found that 191 Nepalese workers died in 2010. The Indian embassy in Qatar recorded 212 deaths in 2013 and around 700 deaths between 2010 and 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation is particularly dire for the millions of Asian migrant domestic workers, almost exclusively women, employed in the region as live-in nannies, cleaners, and caretakers for the elderly. Isolated in private homes, often prohibited from leaving the workplace, and excluded from key protections in national labor laws, they are at heightened risk of exploitation and abuse, and they are sometimes subjected to conditions of slavery. These abuses have also led some countries such as Nepal to adopt well-intentioned yet discriminatory measures, such as banning women under the age of 30 from working in Gulf countries—which can push them into irregular migration channels with heightened risk of exploitation and trafficking.\n",
      "\n",
      "The six GCC countries are considering a mandatory standard contract for domestic workers. It would include provisions for a weekly day of rest and paid annual and sick leave, and give workers the right to keep their own passports. However, the proposed contract falls short of even the minimal protections provided to other workers under the labor laws of these countries, which, for example, limit the hours of work and are linked to national enforcement mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "In January, Saudi Arabia executed Rizana Nafeek, a Sri Lankan woman, after convicting her of the death of her employer’s 4-month-old baby. Nafeek was 17 when the child died under her care and the Saudi authorities executed her in violation of the kingdom’s international obligations and despite widespread condemnation by other governments and rights groups. There were also concerns that Nafeek did not receive legal assistance or competent translation upon her arrest and during her trial. Nafeek’s case highlighted the plight of domestic workers in GCC countries but also the numerous barriers migrants face in seeking redress from the justice system or fair treatment when in conflict with the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regional Reform Efforts\n",
      "\n",
      "While Asian and Middle Eastern governments have introduced incremental reforms for migrant labor practices, so far they have proved inadequate to sufficiently address ongoing abuse. In 2003, Asian countries set up the Colombo Process, a regional consultative process to address the needs of contractual migrant workers employed overseas. Participating labor-sending countries met in Dhaka in 2011 and declared the need to promote the rights, welfare, and dignity of migrant workers, including promoting transparency and openness in recruitment processes and strengthening monitoring and supervision of recruitment practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2008, the United Arab Emirates hosted the Abu Dhabi Dialogue, supported by the International Organization on Migration, to facilitate an inter-regional consultation between labor-sending countries and labor-receiving countries on contractual migrant workers. In 2012, participating governments, including South Asian countries and all six GCC countries, adopted a Framework of Regional Collaboration committing to prevent abuse and foster greater benefits from migration. These include reducing recruitment costs, developing standard employment contracts, and making recruiting agencies responsible for the activities of local-level labor brokers. It also recommends pre-departure and post-arrival information seminars for migrant workers and government action to enforce labor laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abuses against migrants are often linked to gaps in information, poor coordination, and competition for jobs, so it's a step in the right direction for governments to sit around the table and address these problems together. But these processes have been slow and non-binding, resulting in little change on the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some countries have attempted to improve oversight of labor migration through bilateral agreements, but uneven bargaining power between sending and receiving countries has meant that the resulting agreements are often weak.\n",
      "\n",
      "We believe SAARC can provide a solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAARC has expressed its commitment to promoting the welfare of the people of South Asia and strengthening cooperation among member states in international forums on matters of common interest. International labor migration is an area of tremendous relevance and shared concern for SAARC members and one in which critical protection gaps could best be addressed through a regional approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Human Rights Watch urges SAARC to:\n",
      "\n",
      "Foster regular and increased cooperation and dialogue among member states on international labor migration, including through establishing an agreement to develop a common set of minimum standards, monitor practices, and seek reforms with labor-receiving countries collectively; and\n",
      "\n",
      "Adopt reforms at home and push for reforms in GCC countries based on international human rights standards and best practices, particularly the ILO Multilateral Framework for Labor Migration and the Dhaka Principles for Migration with Dignity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Key elements of SAARC migrant worker reforms should include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Respect for the rights of migrants to join or form trade unions in line with ILO Convention No. 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise, and respect for migrants’ rights to collective bargaining as set out in ILO Convention No. 98 on Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining;\n",
      "\n",
      "Improved regulation and monitoring of recruitment agencies, including, consistent with ILO Convention No. 181 on Private Employment Agencies, the elimination of recruitment fees charged to migrant workers, requirements for agencies to conduct due diligence to screen the recruiters with whom they partner, and increased state capacity for investigations, inspections, and enforcement;\n",
      "\n",
      "Ratification and implementation of international labor treaties with key protections for migrant workers, including ILO Convention No. 97 on Migration for Employment, ILO Convention No. 143 on Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions), and ILO Convention No. 189 on Decent Work for Domestic Workers; and\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular and increased dialogue and cooperation on labor migration policy and enforcement among labor-sending and receiving countries, in consultation with social partners, civil society, and migrant worker organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "SAARC member states should improve protections for its nationals abroad by collectively urging GCC countries to:\n",
      "\n",
      "End the exclusion of domestic workers and other classes of migrant workers from key protections in their national labor laws, and ensure that contracts, recruitment practices, and other conditions comply with standards in ILO Convention No. 189;\n",
      "\n",
      "Enforce the principles of non-discrimination and equal treatment of migrant workers;\n",
      "\n",
      "Reform of the kafala sponsorship system by allowing workers to change jobs or return to their country without requiring employer consent, regardless of how long they have worked for that employer, and repeal employers’ power to cancel workers’ visas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensure safe and decent working and living conditions, such as regular payment of wages and no confiscation of passports, including by significantly increasing the number and training of labor inspectors, and imposing deterrent sanctions on violators.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improve and facilitate migrant workers’ access to judicial remedies and credible grievance mechanisms without fear of recrimination or dismissal, and by making competent translation and legal assistance available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enforce national anti-trafficking laws to ensure prosecution of employers and recruitment agents involved in the forced labor of migrant workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "We remain, as always, available to share our views and knowledge or to provide any additional information that can help to address the need for urgent reforms required to protect contractual migrant workers.\n",
