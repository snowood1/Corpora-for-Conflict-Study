      "The $5 million initial appeal will cover anticipated funding gaps tied to the Trump Administration’s Executive Order banning refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. This emergency funding will support those who look to the IRC’s 29 offices across the United States for necessary and immediate aid on arrival and beyond— including housing, cultural orientation, health care, education, employment, and immigration services. Contributions will also support the work of IRC’s dedicated field teams who are crucial to ensuring clients are provided with a solid foundation so they can build on it and successfully integrate into American society.\n",

There is nothing more horrific than attacking an aid vehicle that is attempting to rush injured civilians to a hospital to save their lives. The IRC is working with local authorities to condemn this attack, but this fighting is case in point that South Sudan needs a stable, unified government to stop the fighting and ensure protections for civilians. The South Sudanese people have endured years of violence and poverty, forced to flee their homes and unable to access basic life saving services. It’s time for all warring parties to adhere to the deadlines it has set for itself, take charge and deliver peace and security to the people of South Sudan.”\n",

      "UNIQLO is pleased to launch a new campaign to raise awareness around the global refugee crisis, together with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit organization behind Sesame Street. Sesame Workshop and the IRC are implementing a groundbreaking early childhood intervention for refugee children and families in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria; UNIQLO will promote their work with “Cards for Hope,” a campaign running November 12th to December 2nd.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the campaign, UNIQLO will be selling special greeting cards featuring artwork by Syrian refugee children in Lebanon, created specifically for the campaign. The cards are available now in New York City stores (Soho, 5th Ave., and 34th St.) and in San Francisco at the Union Square store. Starting November 19th, they will also be available at UNIQLO.com. UNIQLO will donate 100% of the sales from the cards to Sesame Workshop and the IRC’s transformative early childhood development work in Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, which has the potential to give millions of children the socioemotional skills they need to succeed in school and later in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“UNIQLO is proud to use its global platform in the apparel industry to raise awareness of the global refugee crisis with the ‘Cards for Hope’ campaign,” said Jean Shein, Global Director of Sustainability at UNIQLO. “We look forward to bringing these beautifully-designed greeting cards into our stores to highlight Sesame Workshop and the IRC's work to bring education and nurturing care to children impacted by the refugee crisis.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "UNIQLO will also invite elementary school groups to participate in drawing workshops at retail locations in New York, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Berlin, with special appearances by costumed Sesame Street characters. At the workshops, students will learn about the refugee crisis from IRC educators and create drawings about their dreams for the future, just like the children in Lebanon did for the greeting cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Building a better future starts with imagination,” said Sheila Kelly, Sesame Workshop’s Chief Development Officer. “Working with the IRC, we’ve seen a generation of children affected by war and displacement who have been denied the ability to imagine a life beyond the here and now. By fostering moments of learning, laughter, and creativity through our joint program—and amplifying that work through campaigns like UNIQLO’s ‘Cards for Hope’– we hope to help displaced children in the Syrian response region dream of brighter tomorrows.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The trauma of being forced to flee your home as a young child is not only painful in the short-term, but also causes toxic stress, which impacts social-emotional development in the long-term. Together with Sesame Street, the IRC will address these issues for millions of children displaced by the Syrian crisis, and help restore their dreams for the future,” said Lauren Gray, Senior Director of Institutional Philanthropy and Partnerships at the IRC. “We’re so excited to have UNIQLO - one of the largest fashion brands in the world - launch this campaign to raise awareness around the refugee crisis and celebrate our work to bring hope and opportunity to millions of children.”\n",

      "Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras should end the Greek government’s “containment policy” of confining asylum seekers to the Aegean islands, 19 human rights and humanitarian aid organizations said in an open letter released today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thousands of people, including very young children, single or pregnant women, and people with physical disabilities, are trapped in abysmal conditions as winter sets in. Forcing asylum seekers to remain in conditions that violate their rights and are harmful to their well-being, health, and dignity, cannot be justified by the implementation of the EU-Turkey deal, the organizations said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement in March 2016, the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos, and Leros have become places of indefinite confinement. Thousands of women, men, and children are trapped in deplorable and volatile conditions, with many denied access to adequate asylum procedures. Asylum seekers who arrived on the islands in the first days of the implementation of the EU-Turkey Deal have been stuck there for almost 19 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent increase in arrivals of men, women, and children has increased the pressure on the already overcrowded reception and identification centers known as hotspots. Current arrivals are still comparatively quite low and should be manageable for Greece and the EU more broadly, but they include a significant number of women and children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The situation is particularly critical on Samos and Lesbos, where a total of more than 8,300 asylum seekers and migrants are living in hotspot facilities meant for just 3,000. The recent announcement that 2,000 asylum seekers will be moved from the two islands to the mainland in the coming weeks as an emergency decongestion measure is a positive development, the groups said. But it is not sufficient to alleviate the current overcrowding of the facilities and does not sustainably address the systemic issues that have created this emergency situation – namely the containment policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the approach of the third winter since large-scale arrivals on the islands began, it is evident that the Greek authorities cannot meet the basic needs and protect the rights of asylum seekers while they remain on the islands. Implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement has been cited by EU and Greek officials as a justification for the containment policy. But forcing asylum seekers to remain in conditions that violate their rights and are harmful to their well-being, health, and dignity, cannot be justified, the organizations said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organizations urged Prime Minister Tsipras to protect the human rights of asylum seekers trapped on the islands by ending the containment policy. They should be transferred to the mainland so that they can be provided with adequate accommodation and services to meet their needs and to ensure that their asylum claims are fairly heard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quotes from Participating Groups\n",
      "\n",
      "“Greece should end its cruel policy of trapping asylum seekers on the islands,” said Eva Cossé, Greece researcher at Human Rights Watch. “People should not be forced to suffer another winter in unheated tents and without proper services.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The policy of containment is putting the lives of people who are seeking sanctuary in Europe at risk,” said Jana Frey, the International Rescue Committee’s country director. “While we welcome the government’s announcement to move 2,000 people on Lesbos and Samos off the islands in the coming days as an emergency measure, this can only be seen as a first step. Far more must be done to both improve conditions on the islands, and move the most vulnerable to the mainland, in order to ensure that lives are not lost this winter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The EU-Turkey deal must no longer be used as pretext to strand asylum-seekers in inhuman conditions on the Greek islands’’ said Irem Arf, Amnesty International’s researcher on migration. “It is imperative that the Greek government urgently move people to mainland Greece.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“The policy of implementing the EU-Turkey Statement has been violating asylum seekers’ rights under international law, and has contributed in disrupting social cohesion in the Greek islands affected,” said Spyros Rizakos, director of Aitima. “It is high time the EU and Greek authorities abandoned this policy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Europe is refusing to offer humane reception conditions and dignity to people in need who arrive on our shores,” said Nicola Bay, head of mission for Oxfam in Greece. “Greek and EU authorities should immediately transfer migrants to the Greek mainland instead of leaving them trapped in abysmal conditions on the Greek islands.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Making these Greek islands a huge detention center isn’t in the interests of anyone,” said Gianmaria Pinto, Country Director of the Norwegian Refugee Council. “We all know what it is needed, including the government: to provide vulnerable people trapped on the islands with dignified accommodation and adequate services, without overlooking legal aid.”\n",

      "Athens, October 23, 2017\n",
      "\n",
      "We, undersigned human rights and humanitarian non-governmental organisations, are writing to express our deep concern at the deteriorating conditions for thousands of women, men and children, seeking asylum and trapped on the Aegean islands as winter sets in.\n",
      "\n",
      "We urge you to put an end to the ongoing “containment policy” of trapping asylum seekers on the islands if they arrived after the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Statement of March 18, 2016, and to immediately transfer asylum seekers to the mainland and meet their protection needs, including by providing them with adequate and dignified protection, accommodation and access to services.\n",
      "\n",
      "We acknowledge the efforts of the Greek Government and the solidarity of the Greek people towards asylum seekers and migrants in the past years. Many of our organisations have repeatedly called on the European Union and its member states to demonstrate genuine collective action and share fairly the responsibility towards asylum seekers and migrants arriving in Greece since 2015 in a way that is humane and respects their human rights. However, the disappointing lack of real solidarity and commitment to responsibility sharing by many EU member states is no justification for the current state of asylum seekers on the Greek islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the EU-Turkey Statement came into effect, the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Kos and Leros have been transformed into places of indefinite confinement for asylum seekers. Thousands of women, men and children have been trapped on these islands in abysmal conditions and many lack access to adequate and timely asylum procedures and protection. Some who arrived on the islands in the early days of the EU-Turkey Statement have remained stuck there for 19 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recent increase in arrivals, which are still comparatively quite low and should be manageable for Greece and the EU more broadly, include a considerable number of women and children, and have put further pressure on the already overcrowded hotspots. According to recent government data, the situation is particularly critical in the hotspots on Samos and Lesbos, where a total of more than 8,300 people are living in facilities intended for just 3,000. We welcome the recent announcement that 2,000 asylum seekers will be moved from Samos and Lesbos to the mainland in the coming weeks as an emergency decongestion measure, and hope to see this commitment fulfilled as soon as possible; however, this is not sufficient to alleviate the current overcrowding of the facilities and does not sustainably address the systemic issues that have created this emergency situation. Only uplifting the geographical limitation imposed on the asylum seekers on the islands can provide a sustainable solution.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the ongoing transition to full State management of the provision of services on the islands began in August, a harmonised, holistic response plan has yet to be released, reception conditions are deteriorating, and gaps in basic services, especially medical, are increasing.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Lesbos, more than 5,400 people live in overcrowded tents and containers, with little access to proper shelter, food, water, sanitation, health care, or protection. Dozens of people, including very young children, are crammed into tents with only a canvas cloth separating one family from another. The living conditions are particularly harsh for pregnant women to endure, and place themselves and their babies’ health at risk. Summer camping tents, designed to accommodate not more than two people, are now holding families of up to seven. Accessing water, sanitation and food is particularly difficult for the many people with physical disabilities—for example, people using wheelchairs simply cannot reach these basic services. Single women in the hotspots report harassment by some of the men. And some asylum seekers have gone through their asylum interview without having had the requisite vulnerability assessment critical for determining both the asylum pathway available to them and the care they may require to prevent further deterioration of their health. These conditions have a devastating impact on the long-term well-being of people trapped there.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of human rights and humanitarian non-governmental organisations, including Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) and Human Rights Watch, have documented the impact of these conditions on the mental health of asylum seekers and migrants – including incidents of self-injury, suicide attempts, anxiety, aggression, and depression. Professionals who have interacted with the asylum seekers note that in many cases, the psychological distress they experience has been factored and/or exacerbated by the policy of “containing” them on islands, which also impedes their access to adequate support and mental health care.\n",
      "\n",
      "Implementation of the EU-Turkey Statement has been cited by EU and Greek officials as a justification for the containment policy. But forcing asylum seekers to remain in conditions that violate their rights and are harmful to their wellbeing, health and dignity cannot be justified. As we approach the third winter since large-scale arrivals on the islands began, and\n",
      "\n",
      "the second winter since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Statement, it is evident that the Greek authorities cannot meet the basic needs and protect the rights of asylum seekers while they remain on the islands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Greece has a responsibility to protect the human rights of women, men and children arriving on the islands. That can only be achieved by ending the current containment policy and transferring asylum seekers to the mainland, so that they can be provided with adequate accommodation, services to meet their needs, and access to fair and efficient asylum procedures.\n",

      "The International Rescue Committee today announced the addition of Her Majesty Queen Rania Al Abdullah and Dr. Merryl H. Tisch to its board of directors. One of the longest-standing and largest NGOs based in New York City, the IRC provides humanitarian aid in 40 countries and resettles refugees to 29 U.S. cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are truly honored that Queen Rania has agreed to join IRC's distinguished and active board of directors,” said David Miliband, IRC president and CEO. “She has an extraordinary passion for making a difference on behalf of the most vulnerable, and will bring a distinctive experience and viewpoint to IRC's board, especially on the increasingly vital issue of education for refugees and other displaced people.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Commenting on her new involvement with the IRC, Her Majesty said that “with more than 65 million people displaced around the world today, I cannot be more proud about joining the IRC board of directors, and upholding their work in alleviating global displacement, poverty, and suffering. The IRC responds to the world’s worst humanitarian crises, giving hope to millions of lives that have been destroyed by conflict and disaster. It is an honor to support their mission to ensure that the world’s most vulnerable are treated with the humanity they deserve.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“As one of the nation’s leading voices on education, Dr. Tisch brings invaluable experience and perspective to the IRC board of directors,” said Miliband. “With 37 million children out of school due to conflict, there has never been a more urgent time to address this crisis, and we are honored to leverage the talents of Dr. Tisch for that purpose.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“It is a great privilege to join the board of directors of an organization at the forefront of advancing humanitarian aid,” said Dr. Tisch. “I’m thrilled to provide expertise in an area I have worked my entire life—making sure those most vulnerable receive a strong education. Thanks to IRC, more than 1.3 million children last year gained access to schooling, an exceptional achievement that we can build on together.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Her Majesty Queen Rania is an internationally known advocate committed to improving the lives of women and children displaced by conflict and natural disaster. Passionate about education, Queen Rania believes that every child should have access to quality education around the world. In 2009, Her Majesty championed the 1 Goal campaign for education. She is a board member of the United Nations Foundation (UNF), and UNCIEF’s first Eminent Advocate for Children. She is also the Honorary Chair of the UN Girl’s Education Initiatives and has advocated access to education in forums and gatherings around the world.\n",
      "\n",

Understanding this economic prize is important, but getting there is the fundamental challenge, particularly in the contexts of state fragility and economic vulnerability where most refugees live.

      "With the first case of COVID-19 now confirmed in Libya, the IRC is warning that an outbreak of the disease could have a devastating impact on the country, where conflict continues to tear people’s lives apart.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the disease having been declared a global pandemic, there is no sign of a ceasefire in sight and hostilities escalated dramatically in recent days. Just two days ago, four civilians were killed as the LNA renewed attacks in Tripoli after repeated calls from the international community to halt hostilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of the ongoing conflict, Libya’s health system is severely challenged to meet the needs of all within Libya’s borders. 1.7 million people are already in extreme need of health assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom Garofalo, Country Director for the IRC in Libya, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Since April last year there have been 62 confirmed attacks on health facilities and almost one fifth of Libyan hospitals and primary health facilities are closed. Those that remain open suffer from a lack of specialised medical staff and a properly functioning medical supply chain. Only six per cent are able to offer a full range of services, meaning that the country is ill-prepared for an outbreak of the magnitude of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Close to 150,000 people have been forced to flee their homes over the past 11 months, but in total almost 900,000 are in need of humanitarian assistance. In addition to Libyans who have been displaced from their homes, migrants and refugees are among the most vulnerable. Around 3,200 are being held in overcrowded detention centres, but the majority live in poor conditions in towns and cities where they are under the constant threat of robbery, abduction, detention and abuse. As a result, many live in the shadows and 80 per cent are unable to access health care. This means there is a huge barrier to some of the country’s most vulnerable people being aware of how to protect themselves from a disease that has already had such dire consequences in other countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With essential equipment already in short supply around the globe, and with Libya’s health system already so fragile, the international community must not turn its back on Libya. Libyan public health officials are scrambling to prepare for the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, and have allocated USD 350 million to support the response. But with such vast vulnerability in the population, they risk being overwhelmed, perhaps worse than we’ve seen in other contexts. The IRC will do our best to support the Libyan response with training of front-line health workers and help with isolation facilities, but we urgently need a ceasefire so that humanitarian actors can adapt and scale-up their response further.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It is critical that the EU and member states maintain diplomatic engagement to secure progress towards a ceasefire.

According to the United Nations, inter-agency aid convoys are ready to go to ten besieged and hard-to-reach locations. They include a 45-truck convoy with aid for 90,000 people to Douma in eastern Ghouta. The bombing and fighting is preventing these convoys from delivering life-saving aid.\n",

Is there a ceasefire in Syria? No. And no.”\n",

      "While UN Security Council Resolution 2401 affirms that military operations against the Islamic State, Al Qaeda and Al Nusra Front and other groups designated by the Council as terrorist groups can continue, the resolution also demands that all parties comply with their legal obligations under international law, including the protection of civilians. On Tuesday, civil groups and armed opposition groups in Ghouta wrote a letter to the UN Security Council stating they are committed to deporting designated terrorist groups out of Eastern Ghouta if a real ceasefire provides the conditions for this to happen.\n",

With mistrust and security issues, cases are likely to be going unreported and the true figure could be even higher.

      "As Coronavirus cases surpass 5,000 in Mexico, the International Rescue Committee has launched, together with local authorities and civil society partners, a public health awareness and psychosocial support campaign for shelters at the Mexico-US border in Ciudad Juárez.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project will directly benefit 17 shelters hosting approximately 3,000 individuals and reach surrounding host communities -- indirectly benefiting an additional 10,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The initiative includes sessions on the transmission of COVID-19, protective and preventive measures including the identification of at-risk groups, signs, and symptoms of COVID-19, where to access help and support, reinforcement of public health best practices, and the distribution of hygiene kits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past year, the safety, health, and security of asylum seekers have been put at risk in northern Mexico as US policies have forced over 60,000 to wait in Mexico under the “Migrant Protection Protocols” (MPP) for the outcome of their US hearings and subjected thousands more to “metering” lists that leave them waiting months in northern Mexico to present themselves to US authorities. Now as health risks are rising exponentially with Coronavirus, the International Rescue Committee is scaling up its programming to mitigate and respond to the virus in shelters across Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, supporting 13,000 asylum seekers and surrounding community members.\n",
      "\n",
      "International Rescue Committee’s Regional Director of Latin America, Meghan Lopez, said, “Along their journey, and again in Mexico, refugees and asylum seekers are highly vulnerable to the same exploitation, abuse and targeted violence that forced them to flee their homes in the first place. As they seek protection and safety, there is an overall lack of shelters: not even 10% are able to find space in formal shelters instead resorting to informal shelters of varying quality and safety. The sad reality is that vulnerable populations are seeking shelter to escape violence, only to be exposed to the new global vulnerability: COVID-19. Most shelters, especially informal shelters, are overcrowded, lack resources, have poor ventilation and due to communal living are ill-equipped to allow for the globally recognized measures to reduce COVD transmission. The spread of the coronavirus in shelters along the Mexico-US border is inevitable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Last month, a federal appeals court ruled that MPP violates US law, but authorities continue to place asylum seekers in this program as litigation continues. Shelters in Ciudad Juárez, like elsewhere along the northern Mexico border, have been operating well over their normal capacity due to MPP and metering practices, causing severely overcrowded conditions. Without immediately implementing measures recommended by public health experts to mitigate the further spread of the outbreak, both asylum seekers, as well as the host community, are at exponential risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Olga Byrne, the Director of U.S. Immigration for the International Rescue Committee, said, “Implementation of COVID-19 mitigation efforts at shelters that are already severely lacking in resources and highly overcrowded is urgently needed to slow the spread of the virus along the northern Mexico border. But the policies that have forced people to wait in Mexico in the first place, leading to highly overcrowded shelters, violate U.S. and international law. The vast majority of asylum seekers stuck in MPP have families waiting to receive them in the US. At a time when we are seeing public officials calling for the release of eligible individuals from crowded detention centers, it is absurd to leave asylum seekers effectively confined in under-resourced shelters along the Mexico border.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The International Rescue Committee has been working for a year with local partners to ensure women and LGBTQ+ populations in Ciudad Juarez are supported with the delivery of individual and group counseling. Through partnerships with on-the-ground legal partners, IRC has also assisted vulnerable families and individuals stuck in Mexico to file applications for humanitarian parole based on urgent health risks. The IRC is now responding to the inevitable spread of coronavirus in 17 shelters in Ciudad Juárez. The response will benefit 13,000 people across the Mexico side of the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "In February, the IRC conducted an assessment across five shelters to understand the risks that could contribute to the spread of COVID-19, including insufficient access to running water, inadequate availability of insulation or heating, limited access to private toilets, poor hygiene infrastructure, no availability of space for self-isolation, absence of dedicated health personnel, inadequate safekeeping of medicine (where available) and overcrowded dormitories and common areas.\n",

      "Elinor Raikes, Regional Director for the IRC in Europe and North Africa said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“This devastating development is a testament to the immense vulnerability of the refugees and migrants who remain trapped inside detention centres across Libya. The fear and horror felt by those trapped in Tajoura - and across Libya - is unimaginable. People caught in detention centres must be evacuated to a place of safety outside Libya and search and rescue operations at sea immediately restored to protect those fleeing the violence. A ceasefire is urgently needed. European governments and the US must recognise their role in bringing the warring parties back to the negotiating table.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Many refugees and migrants continue to be intercepted at sea and returned to what is an active war zone. This cannot continue and international leaders - including Europe and the US - must decriminalise the humanitarian actions taking place to protect those who are fleeing Libya. The EU’s decision to withdraw the naval assets in Operation Sophia that provided a vital role in saving lives at sea has meant that thousands more people find themselves trapped in detention centres like Tajoura. Detention is not the answer to the protection of people on the move and Europe and the US must find alternative and sustainable solutions for the most vulnerable people.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Last night’s fires at Moria on the Greek island of Lesbos symbolize the shortcomings of the European response to the refugee crisis. Moria has been operating at over-capacity for months now with refugees crammed into the facility with limited infrastructure in place, limited access to water, and in conditions that do not meet humanitarian standards. The systems put in place under the EU-Turkey deal to process their asylum claims and determine their future are opaque and inconsistent. Preferential treatment based on nationality has led to tensions within the community. While lamentable, it is no wonder that Moria residents have reached breaking point.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Moria serves as a stark reminder to world leaders meeting in New York City today to discuss the global refugee crisis of the flawed and deeply questionable policies put in place by the EU-Turkey deal, and the responsibility that Greece continues to shoulder for the broader refugee crisis in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Global leaders have an opportunity today to commit to a more humanitarian response to the global refugee crisis, one that focuses on legal routes – like resettlement – to ensure that the world’s most vulnerable people have avenues to sanctuary that do not involve, first of all, risking their lives and those of their families in an attempt to reach safety, and second, having to endure an interminable wait in over-crowded, unacceptable conditions as the powers that be determine their fate. Surely, world leaders can do much better than this.\"\n",

      "Nearly one million Rohingya are still waiting for justice and a say about their future, two years after being forced from their homes by mass atrocities in Myanmar, and are struggling for safety and dignity in Bangladesh as refugees. In a joint statement released today, 61 local, national and international NGOs working in the two countries called for human rights for all to be recognized in Rakhine State and for Rohingya refugees to have a role in decision-making about their own lives, including conditions for their return to Myanmar.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NGOs voiced strong concerns about the safety of affected families in Rakhine State, including Rohingya, as the conflict escalates and humanitarian access remains limited. They urged the Governments of Bangladesh and Myanmar to ensure that any return process be safe, voluntary and dignified, as news of the possible expedited repatriation of 3,450 Rohingya refugees circulated this week.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past two years, NGOs have assisted the Government of Bangladesh and UN agencies to effectively provide life-sustaining support to people living in the world’s largest refugee camp. Their collective efforts have stabilized camp conditions, strengthened monsoon preparedness and helped prevent disease outbreaks. But more needs to be done. The agencies called on the international community to increase funding for the humanitarian response in Bangladesh and Myanmar to improve the lives of refugees and host communities, as well as internally displaced persons.\n",

      "Manish Agrawal, Country Director for the International Rescue Committee in Bangladesh said: “The future of Rohingya refugees is at stake. Refugees tell us that they need more than just humanitarian aid. They need opportunities for education, for training and to build their own livelihoods, which will enable them to thrive in years to come and when it comes to return to Myanmar if conditions become conducive, they return stronger. As we mark two years, and wait for conditions in Myanmar to improve for safe and dignified return, the International Rescue Committee calls on donors around the world to step up their support for the almost one million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, including ensuring that the response is fully funded, and urges the Government of Bangladesh to continue their hospitality.”\n",

      "The United Nations Security Council has until July 10 to renew the Syria cross-border resolution, which ensures lifesaving UN aid reaches over four million Syrians living in areas outside of the Government of Syria’s control. 20 NGO leaders - including IRC President and CEO, David Miliband - are calling on the Security Council to renew the resolution for a period of 12 months and to re-authorize UN access to Northeast Syria to ensure vulnerable populations are able to receive the aid they need as humanitarian agencies struggle to scale up and respond to COVID-19. Below is the joint-NGO Open Letter to the Security Council regarding the Syria cross-border resolution:\n",
      "\n",
      "Excellencies,\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations Security Council is now faced with a monumental decision. By July 10, the Council must act to ensure millions of Syrian civilians are not denied access to timely, life-saving humanitarian assistance. It must vote to renew Resolution 2504 (2165), thereby ensuring UN aid can continue to be provided cross-border in a principled manner, on the basis of need alone. Few decisions are so grave as this one, particularly in the midst of the worst pandemic the world has seen in over a hundred years.\n",
      "\n",
      "For more than four million Syrians who live in areas outside of the Government of Syria’s control, the cross-border mechanism is a critical lifeline providing food, shelter, hygiene, and critical medical services. Without it, people will go hungry and will be denied access to critical healthcare services, including those needed to respond to COVID. Simply put, lives will be lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without a resolution that secures access for 12 months humanitarian actors will be unable to adequately prepare for and respond to the spread of COVID-19. The humanitarian response in places such as Idlib, where 76% of the population are women and children, and which saw an unprecedented displacement earlier this year, is already struggling. It is struggling despite the highest volume of aid being delivered cross-border in the entire history of the UN mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, years of conflict have pushed Syria’s health system to breaking point. Hospitals have been damaged and destroyed, often deliberately by warring parties, qualified medical personnel have been forced to flee, and populations are almost entirely reliant on international aid for medical supplies such as PPE and vaccinations. A COVID-19 outbreak would tip a critically weak health system to breaking point. The rapidly deteriorating economy in areas served by cross-border actors, particularly in northwest Syria also contributes to populations becoming ever more reliant on international aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "In northeast Syria, the Council’s decision in January to restrict the UN’s access through the removal of the Al Yarubiyah crossing point has had fatal consequences. Tragically the already weak healthcare sector in the region has suffered the biggest blow. Despite a handful of cross line deliveries since January, only about 31% of the healthcare facilities that were previously supported through Al Yarubiyah have been supplied, and NGOs are unable to fill the gaps that have been left. With six COVID-19 cases already confirmed in northeast Syria, and the real number likely much higher, 11 health facilities are at risk of closure or disruptions, we are facing a critical shortage of PPE, ventilators, hospital beds - and NGO warehouses are completely out of stock of 29 medicines classed as ‘essential’. The Council has the power to address these gaps by re-authorising UN access through Al Yarubiyah.\n",
      "\n",
      "In northeast and northwest Syria, such gaps in healthcare capacity mean prevention of COVID-19 transmission is crucial. Yet for people living in overcrowded displacement camps, with limited and irregular access to water and sufficient sanitation, regular handwashing and social distancing are almost impossible. This is a potentially fatal cocktail of a highly vulnerable and densely packed population, faced with a global pandemic and none of the tools needed to stop or respond to a mass outbreak of the virus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian justification for this resolution remains as valid today as when it was first authorised in 2014 and even more so with the spread of COVID-19. Principled humanitarian action through both cross-line and cross-border modalities remains the only way to support the 11.1 million Syrians in need of assistance. The renewal of Resolution 2504 authorising cross-border assistance through Bab al-Hawa and Bab al-Salam for a minimum of twelve months and the re-authorisation of the Al Yarubiyah crossing are key to achieve this objective. There is no alternative, and no possible way to scale up the response to COVID-19 without it.\n",
      "\n",
      "We look to the Security Council to ensure that this vital lifeline is extended to all Syrians so they can do their part to defeat the global pandemic. COVID-19 calls for global solidarity and action to ensure we do not leave the most vulnerable behind. Now is not the time to scale back humanitarian access.\n",

      "2019 FULBRIGHT LECTURE\n",
      "\n",
      "19, 20, 21 JUNE 2019\n",
      "\n",
      "I am honored to be giving the Fulbright Lecture tonight and want to thank the Fulbright Scholarships and the Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, and King’s College London, for hosting the lectures. The Scholarships are a living memorial to a remarkable, far-sighted American, who combined deep patriotism with serious internationalism. As a Brit living and working in America, I truly appreciate the insight of the Scholarships that we need to expose and explain the two countries to each other. I can tell you: we’re not the same! However, politics on both sides of the Atlantic is besmirched by common problems of puerile nativism and fake news, so the commitment of the Scholarships to rigorous thinking and a global perspective is needed more than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The central concern of the lecture is a dangerous global trend: what I call the Age of Impunity, which I see every day in my work, and which blights the lives of millions of people around the world. By Age of Impunity, I mean a time when those engaged in conflicts around the world – and there are many – believe they can get away with anything, including murder, whatever the rules and norms. And because they can get away with anything, they do everything. Chemical weapons, cluster bombs, land mines, bombing of school buses, besiegement of cities, blocking of humanitarian supplies, targeting of journalists and aid workers. You name it, we are seeing it, and seeing more of it, and seeing less outrage about it, and less accountability for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "So this lecture is about the innocent civilians killed or brutalized by conflict, and whether their lives can be saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is my argument. We have seen impunity throughout history. But today’s Age of Impunity represents a striking deviation from the ten-year period after the middle of the 1990s, when accountability, not impunity, was on the rise. The reasons for this abrupt turn reflect changes in the nature of conflict, and there are some improvements in the interaction between the humanitarian sector and military forces that could make a difference to the lives of the people we serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Age of Impunity is born of political changes. It reflects serious shifts in geopolitics. There is a political emergency as well as a humanitarian emergency. The political sea change is that constraints on the abuse of power are being weakened internationally and nationally at the same time. Where the years after the Cold War saw growing civilian protection internationally and a surge in accountable government nationally, so today we see the reverse. The multilateral system is under assault from its cornerstone in the US, and Brexit represents a further attack here in the UK. Meanwhile, checks on executive power at the national level are also being weakened.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the new arrogance of power, internationally and nationally, and it needs to be understood and then addressed if the trends towards greater protection of the most vulnerable are to be restored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Age of Impunity\n",
      "\n",
      "I am speaking tonight in a personal capacity, but when I fall into “we” in this lecture I mean my colleagues at the International Rescue Committee – a global humanitarian charity founded by Albert Einstein in the 1930s, and now employing around 13,000 staff and 15,000 volunteers in forty countries around the world. We help the victims of war and persecution survive, recover and gain control of their lives. Sad to say, we are a growth business – we have more or less doubled in size in my time as CEO to become an $800 million organization. And we are a growth business in a growth industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am often asked what I most worry about. The answer is simple: the threats to life faced by my colleagues and by the people we serve. Last Saturday in Niger one of my colleagues was killed when Boko Haram attacked a water project he was visiting. A new and chilling normal is coming into view: civilians seen as fair game for armed combatants, humanitarians seen as an impediment to military tactics and therefore unfortunate but expendable collateral, and investigations of and accountability for war crimes an optional extra for state as well as non-state actors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of civilians directly killed by the tactics of war is rising, also the number of humanitarians killed, and the numbers of civilians killed indirectly not by tactics but by war strategies. I am thinking of places likes Syria, Yemen, Myanmar, South Sudan, Central African Republic. They are called civil wars, but are anything but.\n",
      "\n",
      "From 2011 to today there has been a six-fold increase in annual battle deaths, with 2014 and 2015 being the deadliest years on the battlefield since the end of the Cold War.[1] Last year, 70% of casualties from explosive weapons were civilians – more than 20,000 in total.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "Children are particularly at risk, with Save the Children estimating that 142 million children live in high-intensity conflict zones (places with more than 1,000 battle deaths).[3] There are an estimated 1,000 “battle-related” deaths of children every year. In Afghanistan alone, the number of attacks on schools tripled this year from 68 to 192.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ethnic cleansing is on the rise. The Freedom in the World report lists 11 cases this year, compared to 3 in 2005.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "In total, there were 973 attacks on health facilities and health workers in 2018, resulting in the deaths of 167 health workers and injuries to 710.[6] In Syria, attacks on health facilities have gone up (by over 80%) not down since the passage of UN Security Council Resolution 2286 in 2016, which specifically condemned attacks on medical facilities.[7] Nearly 900 medical workers have been killed by airstrikes since the war started.[8] And there have been at least ten strikes in the past two months alone on health facilities whose locations were shared with the Syrian and Russian militaries specifically with the intention of avoiding attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of aid workers killed each year between 2013 and 2018 was more than double the 2001-2005 figure, rising from an average of 52 to 120 a year.[9] Last year 139 were killed, the second highest toll ever recorded.[10]\n",
      "\n",
      "In the decade following the Ottawa Treaty, which banned the use of land mines in 1999, the number of landmine related casualties dropped by 62%.[11] But since 2013 that number has increased by 150%, resulting in 8,605 casualties in 2016 alone.[12]\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s all before you begin to account for the use of chemical weapons, the siege of towns and cities to use starvation as a military tactic, the looting of aid supplies and the widespread rape and sexual abuse. These illegal acts are on the rise because the perpetrators think they can get away with them. That’s impunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impunity does not just explain the fatalities and suffering. The virulence of the violence that defines impunity is a driver of the duration, refugee flows, hatred and recurrence which typify modern war. Remember:\n",
      "\n",
      "Civil wars are lasting longer: according to David Armitage’s book Civil Wars, the incidence of civil wars increased ten-fold after the end of the Cold War compared to the whole period of 1820 to 1989.[13] Civil wars now often last as much as four times longer than interstate wars. And civil wars are now on average three times as deadly as they were in the first half of the 20th century.[14]\n",
      "\n",
      "These civil wars are generating more refugees (29.5 million) and internal displacement (41 million) than at any time since World War II.[15] On average since 1945, five people have been displaced for every one person killed in conflict. In the Syrian war that ratio has been 25 to 1.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are fewer refugees going home than ever before: less than 3% last year.[17] That is not surprising when you consider that the most likely outcome of a civil war is further conflict: 60% of conflicts in the early 2000s restarted within five years.[18]\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary, therefore, to the generalized trends towards peace and prosperity documented by Professor Steven Pinker and popularized by the late Hans Rosling, the life chances of civilians caught up in conflict and fragile states around the world have declined in the last decade. While extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) is declining worldwide, it is growing in fragile and conflict states; education enrollment is growing globally, but it is falling among those affected by conflict; across the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals there is a growing gap between stable but poor states, where progress in reducing poverty is being achieved, compared to war-torn countries and populations, where the figures are going in the wrong direction.[19]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rise and Fall of Accountability\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence of this Age of Impunity is all the more shocking to me because it runs directly contrary to the trends that I thought I saw in my time as a politician and policy maker. My first task as Foreign Secretary was to handle a case of Russian state sponsored terrorism on British soil – the murder of Alexander Litvinenko. So I never viewed the world through rose-tinted spectacles.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I thought that I could see, in the unusual circumstances after the end of the Cold War, a new base camp in the drive for the rule of law in international relations. It turns out the base camp was as good as it gets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s important to remember the history here: The aftermath of the Second World War had seen unprecedented global commitments to human rights, but the historical record was that they were weakly observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preamble of the UN Charter committed every signatory to fundamental human rights, to the dignity of the human person, and to equal rights for men and women and nations large and small.[20] The UN Declaration on Human Rights, adopted in 1946, pledged equality before the law to all human beings.[21] The Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948.[22] The Geneva Conventions on humanitarian treatment in war, adopted in 1949, said that non-combatants should be treated humanely and that civilian hospitals should in no circumstances be subject to attack.[23] The UN Convention on Refugees, adopted in 1951, barred returning people to places where they would not be safe.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "But during the Cold War these commitments were in the main not honored. The UN Charter had reserved for states pre-eminent rights within their jurisdiction. And the Cold War became an excuse to turn a blind eye to terrible abuse. From Czechoslovakia and Hungary to Latin America, from South Africa to Vietnam, from Indonesia to Cambodia, the freedoms promised by the UN Charter were a distant dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "What’s more the immediate aftermath of the Cold War brought chaos and worse in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda (despite the success of the coalition in the first Gulf War and the No Fly Zone over northern Iraq). I am just reading the new biography of Richard Holbrooke. The reviews have described it as an elegy to the American century. It is also a devastating commentary on the preparedness – or lack of it – of the Vietnam generation for foreign policy service. The author George Packer quotes Holbrooke speaking in the early 1990s as follows: “So far into this new, as yet unnamed era, we have only shown a capability to react, which costs dearly in lives and money. Managing chaos is the foreign policy challenge of the 1990s.”[25]\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet out of that experience in the early 1990s, in quick time, came an unprecedented effort to narrow the gap between rhetoric and reality. Four factors came together to drive a period of unusually committed humanitarian diplomacy:\n",
      "\n",
      "The shame at genocide in Rwanda was a shocking wake-up call. This was an era that was supposed to be defined by the freedom of Nelson Mandela, yet here was mass slaughter on grounds of ethnicity on the African continent, and the world stood by;\n",
      "\n",
      "There was the confidence that comes from economic abundance. Notwithstanding the bursting of the dot-com bubble it was said we were in a NICE decade of Non-Inflationary Continuous Expansion;\n",
      "\n",
      "There was an unusual consensus across the left-right divide in Western politics about the exigencies of an interdependent world and the need for global rules;\n",
      "\n",
      "And the second half of 1990s, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, was a time of unusual power for Western liberal democracies. The democratic surge was a genuinely global movement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The end of the Cold War made possible a whole new debate about the global responsibility for the prevention of atrocities. My former French Foreign Ministerial colleague Bernard Kouchner, before he became Foreign Minister, coined the idea of “humanitarian intervention” (droit d’ingerence in French, which literally means the “right to interfere”).\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1998 the Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court. Despite a number of setbacks, the ICC and other international tribunals have indicted over 700 individuals and obtained more than 250 convictions.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1999, I was in Chicago when Tony Blair tried to establish tests – “considerations” in the final draft of the speech – for the right of intervention in what he called a “doctrine of international community.”[27] He pleaded for America not to take a turn to isolationism, and took it as a matter of common sense that it was unconscionable to turn away from war crimes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile UN Secretary General Kofi Annan set out to redefine state sovereignty head on. He argued that globalization changed the game. In 1999 Annan wrote, “States are now widely understood to be instruments in the service of their peoples, and not vice versa. At the same time individual sovereignty, by which I mean that fundamental freedom of each individual, enshrined in the Charter of the UN and subsequent international treaties – has been enhanced by a renewed and spreading consciousness of human rights.”[28]\n",

      "After the genocide in Rwanda and the trauma of Srebrenica in the middle of the 1990s, the clamor that those who commit crimes against their own people be held to account was real. Annan’s International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty gave birth to the idea of Responsibility to Protect. Despite the political divisions and foreign policy mistakes of the invasion of Iraq, (I wrote about this in my book Rescue: Refugees and the Political Crisis of our Time as a strategic disaster), there was a clear new principle in international relations: governments are responsible for the security of their own citizens, but if they don’t fulfill their side of the bargain there is responsibility elsewhere and it will be taken up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth quoting the key phrases from the 2005 General Assembly Resolution which embraced that idea:[29]\n",
      "\n",
      "“Each individual state has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The international community, through the UN, also has the responsibility... to help protect populations...\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the security council, in accordance with the charter, including chapter VII, on a case by case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities are manifestly failing to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.”\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the antithesis of the Age of Impunity. It was the high point of international confidence and commitment to uphold the standards laid out in the UN Charter. It did not hide behind state sovereignty; instead it explicitly laid out its limits. It was not cavalier about the use of force, but recognized that sometimes it would be necessary. It did not pay lip service to prevention of atrocities; it tried to place prevention center-stage. Above all it embraced the idea that peace between nations is only half the equation for international stability; the other half is peace and stability within nations, and that requires a different set of principles, a new set of commitments and a new set of tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is right to point out that operationalizing these tools is fraught with difficulty, contention, risk. But the 2005 General Assembly resolution did seek to make real the commitments of the UN Charter and other documents. It took seriously the idea of a rules-based international order – more seriously than ever before. And there were lives saved as a result. Would be war criminals were on notice. The balance of power was shifting to accountability not impunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was less than 15 years ago. But since 2005 the slide has been consistent: not more accountability, but less.\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing the Storm\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of this shift reflects structural changes in the nature of warfare. There is the internationalization of civil war, “proxy wars,” where external states intervene militarily on one or both sides. This internationalization has risen from 6% in 1991 to 40% in 2015.[30] Yemen would be a good example. Meanwhile urbanization of conflict is a reality, with 85% of armed conflicts taking place in population centers.[31] Organized crime and the war economy has reduced incentives to settlement; DRC would be a good example. And a rise in non-state actors means that the average civil war has 14 parties to the conflict.[32]\n",
      "\n",
      "This raises a question that humanitarians debate all the time: what can be done better to shield civilians in conflict. Here is some thinking from within the sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, account for urban warfare. Studies show that when explosive weapons are used in populated areas, 92% of those killed or injured are civilians, compared to 25% in other areas.[33] It is pretty shocking that the US should have special institutes for jungle and arctic warfare but not for urban warfare. It is even more shocking to visit Mosul and see what happens when there is not such proper account. In removing ISIS from the city, the old city was more or less completely destroyed.\n",
      "\n",
      "By contrast, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) has established no-fire zones around hospitals, residential areas, markets, religious places of worship, and IDP camps.[34] NATO is also in the process of revising its urban warfare doctrine. Now there is movement for the politics to buttress military efforts. Austria has led fifty countries to sign a political declaration in respect of the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. I agree with the Secretary General that all states should join this political process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, take seriously international humanitarian law training and norm adherence. Training in human rights law and military ethics has rightly become a fixture of US military doctrine. Experience shows this needs to be embedded from day one into the curriculum for every soldier and officer; that IHL needs to be anchored in national and community-specific values and history; it needs to be peer-to-peer as much as it is top-down; and it needs to be translated into concrete actions for decision-making and operational actions. My colleagues have found that having humanitarian personnel and IHL experts embedded in military training is more effective than delivering an IHL training to military personnel. The IRC has been involved in this type of work in places like CAR, with some positive results.\n",
      "\n",
      "As coalition-based engagement increases, the US, UK and other militaries need to hold their partners to the same standards. This is particularly important in places like Yemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also some evidence from some work with non-state actors that there can be value in such dialogue. One example is the SDF in Syria, which wanted international recognition and embraced international legal commitments, such as the protection of children. The International Committee of the Red Cross has done some good work to translate IHL in the communities where it operates. For example, they have a program which focuses on Islam and IHL, and the CEO has met with Iraqi Shi’ite Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani, who issued a religious fatwa to remind Iraqi Shi’ites of the Muslim religious tenets requiring humane warfare.[35]\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, improve monitoring and investigation of civilian casualties. The UN has established a range of reporting mechanisms specific to different conflicts and several Commissions of Inquiry. While the documentation of atrocities is deeply frustrating for those who want accountability now, it is critically important for potential justice long-term. And we should note it is worrying enough for some combatants for them to try and block it. National, multinational and UN operations also have a role to play in tracking civilian casualties to inform military strategy and reduce civilian harm. The most striking example of this was NATO forces in Afghanistan which established a Civilian Tracking Casualty Center.[36]\n",
      "\n",
      "These are important ideas. But they are fundamentally constrained. They depend on cooperation of combatants. And they are ignored by many non-state actors, and by states willing to pursue murderous tactics to show that there is such a thing as a military solution. We have seen this in Sri Lanka in 2009; in Syria since 2011, including as we speak in Idlib; in Yemen since 2014; in Myanmar in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that the places where we work are not just moral emergencies which need better management. They are also political emergencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Humanitarian Emergencies Are a Political Emergency\n",
      "\n",
      "If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the new order is epitomized in the photo of Russian President Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Salman high fiving each other at the G20 meeting in Argentina in November last year. With Syria in ruins, Yemen in crisis, and political opponents like Boris Nemtsov and Jamal Khashoggi dead, theirs was the embrace of two leaders unencumbered by national institutions or by the fear of international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political emergency we face today has two elements. First, the assault on international rule-making and the practice of international institutions. As Foreign Secretary I got used to Russia and China defending indefensible actions by governments who were their friends on the grounds that what a state does within its own borders is its own business. They vetoed a UNSC resolution condemning Robert Mugabe’s abuse of power on these grounds. They blocked action against Sri Lankan bombing of Tamil civilians. But now we have something new: The Trump Administration leading from the front in making the same argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you read President Trump’s first speech to the UN General Assembly, he used the word sovereignty 21 times, arguing for harmonious diversity among nations: different nations following different rules and different faiths.[37] Policy has followed. The US has dropped the promotion of human rights around the world from its policy priorities. It decries international institutions like the International Criminal Court and the WTO and top White House advisors have promoted the idea of a new “nationalist international”.[38] The most basic principle of international relations, that territory should not be taken by force, is being challenged, not just in Crimea by Russia or the South China Sea by China, but by American support for annexation of the Golan Heights and for parts of the West Bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yuval Noah Harari calls the vision a “network of fortresses”. That vision is like saying that in the name of sovereignty every car driver should be free not just to choose their make of car, or to decide which music to listen to, but to decide their own traffic rules. It is like saying that every family should be free to decide not just what to feed their children, or where to educate their children, but what immunizations to give their children.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when drivers ignore stop signs or families refuse immunizations they are subject to sanction because they are a threat to themselves and to others. That sanction is what is now being lost in international politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The global public has noticed. Polling in 25 countries commissioned specially for this lecture by the Policy Institute at King’s College London and Ipsos MORI reveals some striking findings.[39] The United States (22%) is now seen as on a par with Russia (24%) and Saudi Arabia (25%) as countries most likely to use “their influence for bad.” By comparison Germany (32%), Canada (37%), and the UN (35%) are seen as most likely to use “their influence for good.” Britain is in Brexit baulk – neither positive nor negative, more likely to be ignored. The poll shows that around the world large number of people are looking for commitment to human rights and global engagement. However it should be shocking that the US should be perceived to have descended to the level of Russia as a global spoiler.\n",
      "\n",
      "The political emergency that has created the Age of Impunity does not end there. The retreat from the rule of law in international relations has its match on the domestic front. And you cannot have a rules-based international order without rules-based national order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NGO Freedom House has documented that since 2006 more than 100 countries have suffered declines in political freedom.[40] Constitutions are rewritten, dissidents imprisoned, journalists silenced, the media kept at bay. Some countries even have potential Prime Ministers debating the suspension of Parliament itself… This is a democratic recession – successive years in which the number of countries suffering a reduction in political freedom outnumbers those enjoying a growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Larry Diamond, author of the forthcoming Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition and American Complacency has summarized what this means: “Every type of regime is getting worse. Liberal democracies are becoming more intolerant. Illiberal democracies are electing authoritarian personalities. Authoritarian regimes that once co-existed with pockets of opposition no longer see the need to bother.”[41]\n",
      "\n",
      "These two parts of the political emergency – international and domestic – come together. The first part enables the arrogance of power. The second represents it. Together they create the Age of Impunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth saying the UK is not immune. In fact Brexit brings these questions center stage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The promise of Brexit was to make Britain an independent rule-maker. But in an interdependent world that is a mirage. In fact Brexit reduces our power in global rule-setting, makes us prey to the trade policies of the world’s big powers like the US and China, and castrates our foreign policy (as the recent silence over the Hong Kong protests shows). A country our size cannot afford a world that is a network of fortresses, and cannot expect on its own to push back against that philosophy never mind defend our own interests. And as the debate about suspending Parliament shows, the strains and stresses of Brexit threaten to turn us into rule-breakers at home as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lessons of this political emergency for me are clear.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, beware the vacuum. The retreat of key parts of the liberal democratic world from global responsibility, starting before the Trump Administration but dramatically extended by it, has created a vacuum, which is being filled by a range of bad actors, who are exacting a terrible price from the world’s most vulnerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, foreign policy ethics are built on domestic fairness. The Western retreat from responsibility has its origins in foreign policy mistakes – for example shame about genocide in Rwanda has turned into fatigue, and shame, about Iraq – but also in the shattering of economic confidence by the global financial crisis, the crushingly disproportionate gains from economic growth for those at the top, and the strikingly dysfunctional politics of some of the world’s leading democracies. The retreat will not be reversed until there is a new economic and social bargain that delivers fair shares at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the fight for civil and political rights is never over. The nationalist and nativist backlash against the rules-based international order has a contagion effect in domestic politics around the world. I was taught at university that civil rights were gained in Britain in the 18th century, and political rights in the 19th century, so the 20th century challenge was social and economic rights. But the lesson of the 100 countries suffering democratic recession is that every generation has to refight the case for civil and political rights. There is no iron law that says dictatorships become democracies but that democracies don’t become dictatorships. Just ask the people of Hungary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, it is not enough to criticize the Trump Administration or Brexiteers: we need to remake the case for international cooperation from first principles. The great mistake of the Remain campaign was to duck the argument about sovereignty and duck the argument for reform of international institutions. In or out of Europe, Britain needs the EU to succeed, because international cooperation will remain a must, but for that it needs to be reformed as well as defended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifth, let’s recognize the new dividing line in politics, between those who believe that laws and norms to protect individual rights, in foreign policy and at home, are there to be observed and strengthened, and those who say “the law is for suckers.” Free societies are built on a simple principle, that power needs to be checked, and that principle needs to be upheld today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arrogance of Power\n",
      "\n",
      "This leads me back to Senator Fulbright. He wrote an important book in 1966, selling 400,000 copies, and in the process breaking with his friend President Lyndon Johnson and many of his party. The focus of the book was foreign policy, and the reason for the breach was Fulbright’s denunciation of the Vietnam War.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is relevant to the Age of Impunity because of its core thesis, captured in its title: The Arrogance of Power.[42] It is the American version of Lord Acton’s dictum about power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fulbright’s opposition to the Vietnam War came from and reinforced his core view about American power: that the sheer strength of America tempted mistakes on a grand and global scale, born of what he saw as a messianic streak in the American character, compounded by lack of knowledge about the rest of the world, and driven by the undeniable depredations of the communist counterpart in the Cold War.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Age of Impunity I have described today is a symptom of a New “Arrogance of Power”. The New Arrogance of Power, in contrast to the Fulbright era, is not born of Western liberal democratic nations, intoxicated by their own virtue, throwing their weight around all corners of the world. Quite the opposite.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Arrogance of Power diagnosed by Fulbright was the product of American strength. The New Arrogance of Power is the product of liberal democratic weakness. The result is the Age of Impunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning that round requires a change of course in foreign policy. But it also requires something else. The checks and balances that protect the lives of the most vulnerable people abroad will only be sustained if we renew the checks and balances that sustain liberty at home. There is a lot of work for us to do.\n",

      "The International Rescue Committee (IRC) welcomes the latest report of the Group of Eminent Experts on Yemen, which adds to the increasing evidence of violations and crimes under international law perpetrated by all sides in the war. With the first round of peace negotiations now less than two weeks away the international community and members of the UN Security Council must now act to protect civilians, bring an end to the violence, and ensure assistance can reach the millions of Yemenis in desperate need.\n",
      "\n",
      "IRC’s Yemen country director Frank McManus said: \"The report of the Expert Group highlights the daily reality faced by millions of Yemenis who must contend with the ongoing risks of air and artillery strikes by all sides, combined with the enormous and often systematic challenges in accessing basic life-saving humanitarian assistance. Even by the grim standards of this war, the mass casualties of the past month have been brutal - and Yemenis are constantly suffering from lack of access to food, clean water, and lifesaving medicine due to systemic obstacles put in place by all sides to this conflict. Like attacks that harm and kill civilians, restrictions on humanitarian assistance violate international law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A real commitment to political and humanitarian progress demands that member states with influence over the parties use it now to secure, an immediate end to the fighting, unhindered flow of humanitarian supplies and staff into and around Yemen, and, independent, impartial, credible investigations into all violations of international law. Today’s report illustrates that Yemen cannot wait. If Martin Griffiths is to succeed he needs more than words of support from the UK, US and France. As the main military suppliers to the Saudi and Emirati-led coalition they have special responsibility to show leadership. The US, UK, and France have leverage to alleviate suffering - they must use it. With the first round of peace negotiations now less than two weeks away the international community and members of the UN Security Council must now act to protect civilians, bring an end to the violence, and ensure assistance can reach the millions of Yemenis in desperate need.\"\n",

      "Based on potential response scenarios, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) estimates between 500 million and 1 billion infections, leading to between 1.7 to 3.2 million deaths, in 34 conflict-affected and fragile countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "There remains a small window of time to mount a robust response to COVID-19 while it is still in early stages in fragile countries; urgent funding to frontline responses is needed.\n",

      "Extreme social distancing unsustainable in most humanitarian contexts, local approaches are needed - as outlined in new IRC report “One Size Does Not Fit All: Mitigating COVID-19 in Humanitarian Settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alarming new analysis by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) reveals that without swift action in coming weeks to mitigate the spread of Covid-19, the world could see up to 1 billion infections[1] and 3.2 million deaths due to COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic in 34 crisis-affected countries served by the IRC[2], including warzones like Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, said: “These numbers should serve as a wake-up call: the full, devastating and disproportionate weight of this pandemic has yet to be felt in the world’s most fragile and war-torn countries. We are still in the critical window of time to mount a robust preventative response to the early stages of COVID-19 in many of these countries and prevent a further perpetuation of this epidemic globally.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminary estimates compiled by IRC are based on epidemiological modelling and data produced by Imperial College London and the World Health Organization. This model takes into account the age structure, household size, and social contact patterns of different countries, as well as mortality patterns from the early outbreak in China. IRC’s calculations for the 34 countries in which we work highlight the extent of the burden on fragile countries of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the importance of immediate actions in coming weeks to influence the trajectory of the epidemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scientists are still studying the drivers of the pandemic in lower-income contexts, including factors such as population health risks which may drive infection rates up, or others such as younger population age structure which may drive mortality rates down; these figures are nevertheless sufficient to spark significant alarm on the international trajectory of COVID-19.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, three significant limitations of the current data suggest that estimates for fragile countries may be conservative at best:\n",
      "\n",
      "Healthcare capacity and virus reproductive rate (R0): The ICL/WHO model uses the best available mortality data, from China, which pre-supposes that levels of medical care available therein would be available elsewhere. As the IRC has previously warned, fragile states have nowhere near the healthcare capacity provided in China. In Venezuela alone, the long-standing economic and humanitarian crisis has forced more than half of doctors to leave the country and 90% of hospitals already faced shortages of medicine and critical supplies.

South Sudan, a country with only 4 ventilators and 24 ICUs and where almost 65% of the population relies on humanitarian assistance, may for instance face famine with a toxic mix of restricted movement, economic instability, reduction in agricultural labor and pre-existing high levels of malnutrition and chronic food insecurity.\n",

      "It is clear that the impact of COVID-19 in these settings will be different than in the developed countries first hit by the pandemic - and a “one-size-fits-all” model based on measures in countries hit first by COVID-19 is unrealistic and potentially counterproductive. In order to identify the bespoke measures that are not only appropriate but necessary for crisis-affected states, IRC has released a new report, “One Size Does Not Fit All: Mitigating COVID-19 in Humanitarian Settings” detailing the risks and possible solutions required to combat COVID-19 in fragile settings - and to avoid exacerbating humanitarian suffering.\n",

Donors, response actors and governments must work together to remove any impediment to humanitarian assistance- adapting restrictions to ensure access to COVID-19 supplies and equipment, food and other basic goods, as well as health, protection and livelihoods services. The IRC is implementing a comprehensive response strategy that aims to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and treat patients, but also focuses on meeting our clients’ other health and economic needs and expanding our protection services for women and girls. Without immediate international action that supports the needs and unique challenges faced by people in these countries in the face of COVID-19, the consequence will be the loss of life and livelihood on an appalling scale.”\n",

      "The gig economy in Jordan has the potential to create new opportunities that could help Syrian refugee women earn a better income, finds a new study by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) for the International Rescue Committee (IRC).\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on interviews with dozens of Syrian refugee women in Jordan, as well as with industry experts, the report finds that the gig economy, also known as “crowdwork” or “on-demand work,” could be a way for vulnerable workers to find clients to purchase their services. However – as with Uber-style work elsewhere in the world – improvements are needed to make gig work fully beneficial to workers, including promoting digital access, providing skills training and ensuring worker protections, and their safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "“After more than six years of conflict, short-term humanitarian assistance is no longer enough to support Syrian refugees struggling in Jordan to pay for rent and other basics”, said Barri Shorey, senior technical advisor for enterprise development at the IRC. “They need to secure a livelihood to support themselves and their families as well as contribute to their host country’s economy.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“This study shows us that although the gig economy is new in Jordan, it could provide economic opportunities for Syrian refugee women who are among the most marginalized in society. But it is critical to make sure that protection and security are built into this sector as it grows in Jordan, to make sure workers get a fair deal”, said Abigail Hunt, research fellow at ODI.\n",
      "\n",
      "With 86 per cent of Syrian refugees in Jordan living below the poverty line, the gig economy could provide a much-needed financial boost. Many Syrian women refugees want to work but face a range of constraints, including limited networks to find opportunities, restrictions on travelling alone, and a heavy unpaid care load.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report found that the gig economy could help overcome some of these barriers, and that the most accessible on-demand opportunities for Syrian women are in areas where they are already skilled, including home catering, beauty services, and to a lesser extent, domestic work. The gig economy jobs are identified via companies running mobile platforms that allow the public to order tasks from an available refugee worker. These companies will in return take a fee or commission when the service is paid for or completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are still come challenges to overcome, though. Only 5% of Jordanian work permits issued to Syrians since 2016 have gone to women. Only 5% of Jordanian work permits issued to Syrians since 2016 have gone to women. Only 5% of Jordanian work permits issued to Syrians since 2016 have gone to women. However refugees’ legal right to gig employment remains unclear, and the report calls for clarification over applicable regulations through a social dialogue with workers, associations, platform companies and the government, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Jordan, the gig economy is still in its infancy. While this newly emerging form of work may offer the potential to help vulnerable communities, the report also encourages more skills training and greater worker protection to increase the likelihood of female refugees both to access the jobs market and find work, and to ensure that gig work is safe and provides a secure income.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IRC will use this research to continue to explore new tech based models of employment in addition to gig work, such as business process outsourcing. In collaboration with Western Union, the IRC in Jordan piloted a project to outsource business tasks (including data entry and verification) to semi-skilled jobseekers able to volunteer in return for a stipend. Based on positive findings from this initial pilot, the IRC is seeking to expand the program alongside international and local partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the IRC helped nearly 6,000 people in Jordan through cash transfers as well as employment and self-employment support to develop sustainable livelihoods for refugees, as well as benefiting host communities struggling with unemployment.\n",

As Libya continues to endure political instability and widespread violence, the IRC is focused on: providing critical healthcare in hard to reach places in western Libya, providing life-saving medicines to primary health clinics, where possible, providing a referral pathway for patients in urgent need, renovating primary health clinics which have been damaged during the civil war, deploying experienced social workers to provide case management and psychosocial support in communities impacted by the conflict.\n",

Our health staff are part of the five Rapid Response Teams the Ministry of Health has created to carry out initial assessments of suspected cases and tracing of their contacts. With most public health facilities closed in Tripoli and Misrata due to a lack of capacity, our mobile support to the Ministry of Health is proving vital in reaching vulnerable communities in this response.\n",

      "On 3 and 4 September, ministers from the affected countries as well as Governors of the Lake Chad region, alongside donor countries, UN organizations, international and regional organizations, and civil society representatives will meet in Berlin, Germany, for a two-day high-level conference on the Lake Chad region, including parts of Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger.\n",
      "\n",
      "The nine-year long conflict in the Lake Chad Basin has dramatically affected the lives of about 11 million people who rely on humanitarian assistance to survive. The insurgency as well as military operations across the four countries have displaced 2.4 million people and left 5 million people food insecure, while significantly reducing economic activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict has taken a heavy toll on the local economies and people´s livelihoods, and has also led to a high number of civilian casualties and grave abuses, such as the recruitment of children by armed groups sexual violence and abductions. The security situation further impedes the humanitarian actors’ access to people in need of life-saving support. For instance, in northeast Nigeria, over 800,000 people still live in hard to reach areas with no access to humanitarian assistance, while military operations in the Lake Chad Islands currently prohibit organizations from providing assistance to the population.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As the protection crisis in the Lake Chad region rages on for another year, children make up over half of those displaced. Women and girls face gender-based violence daily, are abducted, sexually exploited and abused, and struggling to survive early and forced marriage and intimate partner violence,” says Hannah Gibbin, Country Director for the International Rescue Committee in Cameroon. She emphasizes the need for participants at the conference to face the facts head-on and join forces to provide lives of dignity and security.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Last year’s conference helped avert a famine in the region. This year’s conference must not only continue this lifesaving operation, but must make protection of vulnerable children, women and men a top priority. Conflict-affected families depend on the international community to put the lives of civilians over and beyond competing political agendas, such as their war on terror,” said Secretary General for the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland.\n",
      "\n",
      "The humanitarian community scaled up the response significantly in 2017, but humanitarian needs remain massive and will continue well into 2018 and beyond. Yet, eight months into the year, only 26 percent of the appeal for funding to Cameroon has been raised and the humanitarian appeal to support people affected by the crisis in Nigeria is less than half funded. The United Nations estimates that USD 1.6 billion is required this year to help the 10.7 million in need of humanitarian assistance in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The crisis in north-east Nigeria is far from being resolved. Thousands of desperate people continue to arrive into congested areas on a weekly basis both from ‘inaccessible’ areas or across borders, some of them in a state of severe malnutrition. While development efforts to rebuild need to be stepped up, it is crucial that we maintain the necessary assistance to continue saving lives, particularly in remote field locations across Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states” said Jennifer Jalovec, Director of the Nigeria INGO Forum, which consists of 40 organizations working in Nigeria.\n",

      "Hussaini Abdu, Plan International’s Country Director in Nigeria, urges “all humanitarian actors, including donors, to urgently increase prioritisation, funding and coordination of efforts to prevent and respond to ongoing gender-based violence and child protection needs and to fulfil adolescent girls’ sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR).”\n",

However, an International Rescue Committee (IRC) analysis shows a drastic withdrawal by the U.S. on protections for religious minorities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With drastic cuts to U.S. resettlement protection for religious minorities, the very goal of this Ministerial is fatally undermined,” said Nazanin Ash, Vice President of Global Policy & Advocacy at The International Rescue Committee. “The Trump Administration cannot cheer on the world to protect religious minorities in one breath, while substantively cutting its own protections for these groups in the next.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The necessary protections for persecuted religious minorities through the US resettlement program paint a picture of retreat, amidst growing challenges according to Pew Research Center:\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a quarter of governments worldwide imposed substantial restrictions on religion as of 2016, nearly the highest level over the past decade.\n",

      "\n",
      "As the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom identified in its 2018 report, the refugee admissions program remains a vital path to safety for some of the world’s most persecuted populations. During a time when the Administration considers its FY2020 refugee admissions level, it must also consider its commitment to religious minorities, and set a refugee admissions level commensurate with global crises. No religious group has been spared by these cuts to refugee admissions - below are some groups highlighted in IRC’s analysis:\n",

      "Of the 90 million people around the world facing a hunger crisis as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Yemeni civilians are the most vulnerable, teetering on the brink of famine with over 80% of the population in need of humanitarian assistance. As the G20 convenes in Saudi Arabia, the IRC is calling for world leaders to release their funding commitments towards Yemen’s humanitarian response plan and to support a recovery package for Yemen’s beleaguered economy . Moreover, we call on the international community to use their diplomatic leverage - including a suspension of arms sales - to push for a nationwide ceasefire, and bring parties to the conflict to the negotiating table to reach a political settlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "90% of Yemen’s food is imported and with the COVID-19 pandemic restricting supply chains and driving up food prices, coupled with a further 25% drop in Yemeni rial’s value, Yemen is also on the edge of economic collapse. Severe underfunding has forced critical humanitarian programmes to close. As G20 leaders come together to discuss a financial response to the pandemic, Yemen’s humanitarian response plan remains only 48% funded. As a result, 4 million fewer Yemenis were receiving aid each month by late 2020 compared to the response at the beginning of the year – a 30% reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from meeting great and growing financial needs, the IRC is calling on global powers - notably the US, UK and France - to suspend arms sales to the Saudi-led coalition. In the first half of 2020, Saudi-led airstrikes more than doubled compared to the rate of the previous six months and, in September, civilian casualties reached their highest levels thus far this year. Now is the time for all involved parties to change course, and as humanitarian funding falls, further arms sales will only exacerbate the humanitarian need.\n",

      "IRC Yemen Country Director, Tamuna Sabadze said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“The clock is ticking. Day by day Yemenis are pushed further and further into a precarious situation, and for every day that humanitarian commitments are not fulfilled, we run the risk of pushing millions of people into famine. Alarmingly, child malnutrition was recorded at the highest it has ever been in October, and with only 50% of hospitals and clinics operating in Yemen, a nationwide ceasefire is desperately needed to ensure humanitarian organizations are able to reach those most in need. As things stand, people are less concerned about the pandemic and more concerned about their hunger needs.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“There is a good reason Yemen should be at the top of the agenda at the summit in Saudi Arabia. The world’s worst humanitarian crisis is only getting worse - powered by the economic collapse and the ongoing conflict, to which Saudi Arabia is a party, which plummets more and more civilians into hunger and despair.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 18,500 civilians have been killed by the more than 64,000 individual Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen since the war started in 2015. The recent report from the Group of Eminent Experts (GEE) on Yemen documents attacks on food storage and water transportation, and the diversion of water for profit. The GEE has stated clearly that war crimes have likely been committed by both sides to the conflict. With the privilege of holding the G20 summit in Saudi Arabia comes the responsibility of both leadership and commitment to alleviate the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. International humanitarian law must be upheld by all involved parties, funding commitments to the humanitarian response plan must be fulfilled and arms sales that blindly support a war that is morally bankrupt and strategically misguided,must be suspended.\n",

Most refugees and people living in crisis earn small wages working in the informal sector and have seen their businesses shuttered or are unable to get supplies due to COVID-19 mitigation measures and market shortages.

As the largest provider of health assistance in Rakhine state, the IRC is particularly concerned by the over 120,000 internally-displaced persons cut off from life-saving services, particularly in light of dire pre-existing conditions. An IRC analysis from late 2016 revealed that civilians in Rakhine’s camps are up to ten times more likely to contract deadly diseases like tuberculosis, and at far greater risk of sexual violence and child marriage, due to camp conditions.

During the past two years, more than 660,000 refugees have passed through the Greek island of Lesbos, the epicenter of the largest migration of people since World War II. The island’s population is only 86,000, but these generous people have invited 25,000 Syrians, Afghanis and others to settle among them. Mayor Galinos is being recognized for his efforts to assist hundreds of thousands of refugees as they face a harrowing journey, and for working to bring awareness to the tragic human costs of the current refugee crisis.\n",

      "At least 21,347 people have been killed in conflict, including more than 5,800 civilian adults and children who were directly targeted (1), despite the adoption of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a global cessation of hostilities some 90 days ago. Instead of a ceasefire, allowing countries and humanitarian organisations to focus on battling the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing violence is pushing millions to the brink of conflict induced famine and hindering the battle against the outbreak.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leading aid organisations urge Heads of State meeting today in the Security Council in New York to urgently renew their call for a global ceasefire, and to accelerate COVID-19 response capacity and access in areas affected by conflict and humanitarian crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The UN Secretary-General issued his first call for a global ceasefire in March, yet early signs of progress have since stalled, as armed groups have continued or even increased fighting. This is contributing to a devastating increase in food insecurity and the likelihood of famine caused by conflict. The UN issued a warning only last week on the risk of conflict-induced famine in South Sudan, Yemen, DRC and northeast Nigeria. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have only worsened food insecurity, with an estimated additional 110 million children going hungry globally as a result of the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In South Sudan, increased inter-communal violence has contributed to nearly 6.5 million people, or over half of the country’s population, facing dire levels of food insecurity. In Yemen, where humanitarian organisations face extremely challenging barriers to access to those most in need, civilians continue to fall victim to airstrikes and high levels of acute food insecurity. In DRC, aid workers have come under attack recently, and hunger levels are spiking in the Ituri district as a consequence of ongoing conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lack of progress towards peace is leaving millions of people suffering from the impacts of war and the global COVID-19 pandemic, the aid organisations warn, whilst limiting humanitarian access to extremely vulnerable communities. As the virus continues to compound suffering and drive the threat of famine across different conflict zones, it is vital political leaders put their weight behind the call for a humanitarian pause to fighting, facilitate safe and sustained access for aid workers, and accelerate COVID-19 response in conflict and humanitarian crisis affected countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children said: “The truth is we are dangerously running out of time. Already warnings are ringing out of the potential for widespread famines in at least four countries as result of the coronavirus pandemic. It is no coincidence that many of the countries now most at risk of hunger are also the ones mired in conflict - and it is children who too often pay the deadly price. Children need more safety and more protection, but fighting has continued or in some cases gotten worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "“COVID-19 has already had a devastating impact on children’s lives, limiting their access to healthcare, food, education and protection. A 90-day pause in fighting that is actually implemented on the ground could be the lifeline that helps to prevent mass starvation and to protect a generation of children.”\n",

They need peace, justice and accountability and they need the Security Council and all governments with access to the warring parties to use their powers of persuasion to bring sustainable peace immediately.”\n",

      "Abby Maxman, President and CEO of Oxfam America said: “To end conflicts now, we urgently need sustainable ceasefires. And for that to happen, leaders must listen to those directly impacted by the conflict, especially diverse women’s groups. Women are well-practiced in successfully negotiating temporary ceasefires for aid to pass and to evacuate civilians, and their meaningful engagement increases the chances of addressing the root causes of conflict and builds buy-in for agreement.\n",

      "Andrew Morley, President and CEO of World Vision International, said: “The fallout from COVID-19 will wreck the futures of an entire generation of children - unless we act now. As ever, it is the most vulnerable girls and boys, whose lives were already afflicted by conflict, who are most at risk. For those facing such unbearable strain, a call to peace is the only way forward. All parties to conflict must pause and respect the lives of humanitarian and health workers. The international community must also urgently step up to resource an accelerated COVID-19 response in these fragile contexts. This is a global pandemic – and nothing but a united, global effort will suffice.”\n",

      "\n",
      "The Flores Settlement Agreement was reached following over a decade of litigation brought by children from Central America against the U.S. government in response to their prolonged detention and mistreatment in federal custody in the 1980s.\n",

      "Jenn Piatt, Senior Director, Refugee Resettlement and Asylum Policy and Advocacy at the International Rescue Committee:\n",
      "\n",
      "“At a time when the administration has argued children do not even deserve a toothbrush, it seeks to undermine the minimum protections in Flores. A departure from Flores will only exacerbate the dangerous conditions in detention centers revealed recently by the HHS Inspector General, further subject children to inhumane treatment, and possibly subject children to indefinite detention. Seeking asylum is legal, and nobody – least of all children – should be punished for doing so. “The administration needs a history lesson. Flores was put into place because the government routinely demonstrated that it was incapable of treating children in civil immigration detention even remotely well. For decades in America, immigrant children were subjected to prolonged detention with unrelated adults and criminal offenders, simply for seeking safety. Further, these children were subject to sexually-invasive strip searches, denied basic food and water, and had inadequate access to educational services – all while languishing in detention for years in many cases. “This rule does not uphold the spirit of Flores and should be swiftly challenged. Based on comments by DHS this morning, it appears the administration already knows this and instead of working to improve conditions for children, the administration seeks to move ahead with policies that are legally insufficient and would not protect children.”\n",

      "Ahead of International Women’s Day, the International Rescue Committee’s (IRC) violence experts today revealed the five most dangerous places to be an adolescent girl right now. Analyzing indicators such as child marriage, adolescent birth rates, literacy, rates of violence and child labor, in contexts where IRC operates, IRC experts concluded that conditions in Niger, Yemen, Bangladesh, South Sudan and the Central African Republic (CAR) are currently posing the most dangers to girls living there. The IRC calls on the international community to redouble its efforts to prevent and respond to violence against women and girls in all humanitarian settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "IRC compared available data against the expertise of its staff to develop the list of the most dangerous places for girls. Adolescent girls living in each context included in the list are facing violence, discrimination, and a lack of equal opportunities. Notable figures contributing to the conclusions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Rates of child marriage in Niger: Over ¾ of girls are married before the age of 18.[1]\n",
      "\n",
      "Gender gap in Yemen: Since 2006, Yemen has consistently ranked last in the World Economic Forum’s Gender Gap Index.[2]\n",
      "\n",
      "Rates of violence against women and girls in South Sudan: Up to 65% of women and girls have experienced physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime, which are among the highest rates of violence against women and girls in the world.[3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of safety for Rohingya girls in Bangladesh: 77% of women and girls residing in the 28 identified settlement sites hosting refugees across Cox’s Bazar District reported feeling unsafe.[4]\n",
      "\n",
      "High level of gender based violence in CAR: Rape has been documented as a weapon of war, committed by all sides of the conflict that has raged since 2012.[5]\n",
      "\n",
      "“These disturbing numbers prove just how critical it is for humanitarian actors like the IRC to provide programs that address the unique needs of adolescent girls”, said Nicole Behnam, senior director of IRC’s Violence Protection and Response unit. “They are amongst the most marginalized populations on earth, and efforts to support and empower them are lifesaving, not optional. Until we achieve true gender equality, young girls will suffer the most. This is unacceptable and it’s why the IRC continues to advocate for changes that will improve the lives of girls everywhere.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“With the right support and investment, we can enable young girls - an entire generation of future leaders - to start taking control of their lives. Girls need services – education, health, response to and prevention of violence – that match their needs. At the same time, we should be working to create environments of gender equality so that girls are valued and allowed to thrive”, Behnam continued.\n",
      "\n",
      "As part of its efforts to highlight the unique needs of adolescent girls in crisis, IRC in collaboration with Girl Rising, Citi and HP, will release a short film called Brave Girl Rising (BGR) on International Women’s Day. BGR is about a refugee girl named Nasro, who is supported by IRC’s Women’s Protection and Empowerment program in Dadaab. The film is narrated by Tessa Thompson (Thor: Ragnarok, Westworld, Men in Black: International) and is written by refugee poet Warsan Shire. The film will be found at https://girlrising.org/brave.\n",
      "\n",

      "The Lake Chad Basin reflects the modern face of humanitarian crisis: violence, climate change and poverty - threatening the Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Miliband, President and CEO of the International Rescue Committee said:\n",
      "\n",
      "“I traveled to Chad and Cameroon to meet IRC staff and witness the modern face of humanitarian crisis: multiple fronts of conflict, growing displacement and poverty all deteriorating thanks to the undeniable impact of climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "Across the Lake Chad region, the lives and livelihoods of 10 million people are threatened by this new reality. 4.5 million are now displaced across the region, which is also warming at 1.5 times the global rate. In Chad, where 87% of the mostly rural population now lives below the poverty line, increasing drought and resource stress is leaving one in four people food insecure and multiplying the threat of violence. In Cameroon, humanitarian needs have never been greater as the country grapples with two concurrent emergencies: a budding conflict in the North-West and South-West, and an uptick in extremist violence in the Far North.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against this backdrop, both countries have gone to extraordinary lengths to respond to the myriad of challenges they face - also coping with the responsibility of hosting 800,000 refugees collectively from the likes of Sudan and the Central African Republic. But the situation I witnessed is nonetheless one of ever-increasing need. The trends in violence are getting worse not better; the deaths of two IRC colleagues in Niger and Nigeria last month are testament enough. In Chad, 40,000 refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) have fled Boko Haram in the Lake region since January alone; in the Far North of Cameroon, the country second-most affected by Boko Haram, I met some of the nearly half a million displaced who have been living in limbo for the past three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Cameroon, conflict in the North-West and South-West is now also the fastest-growing displacement crisis in Africa. 1,800 civilians have already been killed, half a million displaced, 700,000 children unable to attend school. I was shocked by the accounts of internally-displaced Cameroonians I met in Limbe, in the country’s South-West, receiving cash vouchers from the IRC. I heard from a man who, held at gunpoint, witnessed his daughter being humiliated in front of him by armed combatants; an IRC assessment confirms that episodes of violence like this are the case for eight in ten women and girls caught in the conflict. Without a steep change in internal political dynamics, full-blown civil war is sadly on the horizon. The IRC's 150 staff on the ground are preparing for the long haul.\n",
      "\n",
      "The climate of growing insecurity in the region is paired with climate change in driving up extreme levels of hunger and malnutrition. In the Guera region - where malnutrition levels amongst children under five are now far beyond World Health Organization emergency thresholds - I was able to visit the IRC’s vital work in fighting this scourge. 80% of the 50 million children with acute malnutrition globally lack access to treatment, challenged by climate stress and growing fronts of conflict. The need for innovative solutions is obvious. The IRC, along with our partners, has pioneered a new solution that treats moderate and severe acute malnutrition together in one treatment program - with the aim of saving millions of lives in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "This modern face of humanitarian crisis is one of ever-increasing complexity. But it is not insoluble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The international community needs to provide a concerted boost in humanitarian assistance. Despite increasing desperation in both Chad and Cameroon, neither UN appeal is more than a quarter funded, and Cameroon’s remains the least funded in Africa. The Lake Chad region remains one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the world; addressing these challenges will also require an integrated, cross-border strategy to meet basic needs while also promoting stabilization, governance and peacebuilding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crises facing Cameroon and Chad are multifaceted and long-term, but in each case, the funds destined to support a decade on average of displacement are slim. Refugees and IDPs need to be able to rebuild their lives and support themselves alongside their host communities. The nature of these crises requires donors, more importantly, to dismantle the increasingly obsolete distinction between humanitarian and development financing, provide multi-year funding and invest in interventions that support self-reliance of displaced and host communities in the medium to longer term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the progress of Cameroon, Chad and other fragile states towards meeting key Sustainable Development Goals is stagnating because people “caught in crisis” are excluded from key SDG indicators, national action plans and resources. Political leaders cannot miss the opportunity at this September’s High-Level SDG summit to bring refugees and displaced people into the SDG process- without course correction, they will simply not be met.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, no progress will be possible without recognizing and addressing the specific needs of women and girls. In Cameroon and Chad, along with other fragile contexts, they fall furthest behind on all SDG indicators: because of who they are and because of where they are born. An IRC analysis has revealed that gender-based violence services receive 0.12% of all humanitarian funding on average. In order to address this challenge and realize the vision laid out in the SDGs of gender equality, inclusive growth and decent work for all, donors must commit to a significant increase in funding and holistic strategies aimed at self-sufficiency and economic independence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The climate degradation, hunger and violence I witnessed in Chad and Cameroon will only metastasize - here as in other fragile parts of the world. It will require an equally modern take on humanitarian response, a refreshed and redoubled commitment - by local, national and international actors - to leaving no one behind.”\n",

      "The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is proud to assist parents reunite with their children through the U.S. Department of State Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee and Parole Program. Since December 1, 2014, parents lawfully in the United States have been able to bring their minor children from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador who are living in danger from pervasive violence and constant fear. Many of these children have been able to avoid a dangerous journey by seeking safety in the United States via the CAM program, and have begun new lives here with refugee status protected under international law or under the protections provided by this nation on humanitarian grounds as parolees. These children are no longer separated from their parents due to conflict and unrest, and are able to attend school and have a childhood free from violence. This has saved children’s lives and kept families together.\n",
      "\n",
      "On August 16, 2017, the U.S. government announced an end to the automatic parole option for these children. Children who had already received conditional approval to come to the United States to join their parents will be notified that this approval is being rescinded. This action will tear apart families who have been waiting anxiously to bring their children home to safety, and runs counter to this nation’s core values. Ending this life saving parole program also raises questions about the fates of children who have already laid roots in American communities and whose futures are now uncertain.

We recognize that major changes to response strategy will take time, and we give our full support to Ebola response coordinator David Gressly as he continues to work to ensure aid agencies with operational experience in North Kivu are being heard. As Ebola response leadership meets today in Geneva to continue this reevaluation, we encourage those involved to continue to make real community engagement and continued demilitarization of the response top priorities. This is yet another positive opportunity towards turning around the response and setting us on track to stop the spread of this deadly disease.”\n",

      "Almost one year since the announcement of the outbreak, Ebola continues to spread, recently with an average of 10 to 15 cases per day. The epicenter of the outbreak has moved back to Beni, an area once thought cleared of the disease. The Ebola Treatment Center and transit center in Beni are full, forcing suspected cases to remain at health clinics in isolation while they wait for space to become available. As cases rise, distrust of Ebola response actors deteriorates. People are still afraid to come to health clinics if they are experiencing Ebola symptoms.\n",

      "\n",
      "The International Rescue Committee (IRC), which so far has resettled 270 Syrians to the United States, said today that the country’s commitment to accept between 5,000 and 8,000 Syrian refugees before the end of 2016 can only be a first step. According to the IRC, the figure doesn’t come close to addressing the crisis in and around Syria, which is now engulfing Europe where Germany, for example, expects the number of refugees and asylum seekers to this year reach 800,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year UNHCR, the UN refugee resettlement agency, called on the international community to resettle 130,000 Syrian refugees before the end of 2016. Today the IRC reiterates its call on the US government, long recognized as a leader in humanitarian response, to resettle half of that number – 65,000 – before the end of 2016, a call that was endorsed by fourteen members of the U.S. Senate in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "In almost five years of war, the United States has resettled a mere 1,541 Syrian refugees to this country. Of that number, the IRC has resettled 270 to cities across the United States, including a businessman and his family who fled the bombing of Aleppo, Syria in 2012. The family now lives in New Jersey. Also, a carpenter from Homs, Syria who fled with his family and now lives in Georgia. Each family has expressed great gratitude to the United States for the sanctuary and the opportunities for safe and secure life. But there are far more who, to date, have not been given the opportunity to be considered for refugee resettlement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions in the Syria region, already grave, continue to worsen. One of every four residents in Lebanon, a country whose economy already was struggling, is now a refugee. In camps along the Iraqi border, Syrian refugees languish with little respite or hope that the conflict will end soon. Jordan’s Zaatari Refugee camp is now the second-largest refugee camp in the world. There is no doubt that the overall humanitarian aid response must be stepped up. A vital component of that response is a robust refugee resettlement program for the most vulnerable.\n",

      "David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The US has historically been the world leader in recognizing the moral obligation to resettle refugees. But in the four years of the Syria crisis there has been inertia rather than leadership. As the German government calmly says that it expects 800,000 refugees and asylum seekers in 2015, it is vital for the US to step up its response.\n",

      "IRC applauds President Obama for hosting world leaders for a first of its kind Summit on Refugees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Summit comes at a time of historic displacement when responsibility sharing for refugees among the international community is uneven and more critical than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three pillars of Summit commitments—greater financial support to refugee-hosting countries, increased resettlement slots and pathways to refugee self-reliance through education and work opportunities in host countries—are mutually reinforcing and all required to respond adequately to the needs of the 21 million refugees around the world and the communities and countries to which they’ve been displaced. By requiring the states attending the Summit to deliver concrete commitments, the Summit has put responsibility sharing in specific and measurable terms. This is particularly welcome given the New York Declaration adopted at the United Nations Summit for Refugees and Migrants the day prior did not produce specific or binding commitments from UN Member States.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the creation of a new World Bank Global Crisis Response Platform to provide more comprehensive financial support for refugee-hosting countries is a potentially game changing development and one that IRC strongly supports. It represents a step toward a broader set of tools used beyond traditional humanitarian assistance to support the needs of refugees and their host communities and countries, particularly in situations where they are displaced for years on end.\n",
      "\n",
      "While more than fifty countries attended the Summit and the targets set by the President and Summit co-chairs were met, the true test of the Summit’s success will be whether those commitments are delivered on by attending states. Too often, international conferences lead to pledges on paper and in press releases that don’t translate to real change on the ground. IRC encourages all states that committed to the Summit targets to deliver them and hold other states accountable to meet theirs. Responsibility sharing can be a virtuous cycle and IRC hopes these commitments will be catalytic, encouraging a greater degree of collaboration by all actors toward meeting a defining challenge of our time.\n",

      "In response to Kenya’s high court ruling on February 8, 2017, that the Government of Kenya’s decision to close Daadab, one of the world’s largest refugee camps, is unconstitutional, Kurt Tjossem, East Africa regional director at the International Rescue Committee, said:\n",
      "\n",
      "The court’s decision today is a sound one, but it does not resolve the future of Somali refugees in Dadaab, which, in its current state, is not a sustainable solution. We now need to talk about a way forward, beyond the status quo in Dadaab for Somali refugees, that focuses on long-term solutions – whether it is being self-reliant and able to integrate in Kenya, fully voluntary repatriation, or settlement in a third country. We hope to see successful refugee hosting models like that followed in Uganda – where refugees are allowed to support themselves, use local health and education services, and contribute to their communities – replicated across East Africa and beyond.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dadaab is not designed to be the long-term situation it has now become. In fact, constant threats of closure over the years were not the only factor driving refugees’ decision to head back to Somalia: decreased resources in Dadaab, including cuts in food rations and limits on freedom of movement mean that regardless of the important court decision, there will be continued pressure for refugees to return when it is not yet safe for them to do so.\n",

    "\"New York, NY, August 18, 2016 — The below statement can be attributed to Ciaran Donnelly, Senior Vice President of International Programs at the International Rescue Committee:\\n\"+\\\n",
    "\"World Humanitarian Day is an annual tribute to the tens of thousands of brave men and women who have dedicated their lives to humanitarian service, working tirelessly to alleviate suffering worldwide. Their service has indeed never been more necessary: with 130 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, and an unprecedented 65 million people – the populations of New Zealand, Canada, and Australia combined – displaced from their homes by violence and conflict, the demands on humanitarian action are greater than ever.\\n\"+\\\n",
    "\"And yet, the critical work of humanitarian aid workers remains under threat. Recent attacks on humanitarian staff, most of whom are national, and their facilities highlight the ongoing and increasing dangers they face in carrying out their vital mission. These attacks- from hospitals in Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen to deadly raids in South Sudan- are not only serious violations of international humanitarian law, but a repudiation of the values and aims of humanitarianism. Attacks on aid workers are not just a crime in and of themselves - their impact extends far beyond, penalizing those who depend on this assistance: the world's most vulnerable people.\\n\"+\\\n",
    "\"One aid worker or facility targeted in conflict is one too many. On this World Humanitarian Day, the IRC calls for the full respect of international humanitarian law by all parties to conflict worldwide, as well as the full respect of the sanctity of humanitarian action, allowing for safe, secure and unimpeded access to those in urgent need.\"\n",
    "\"World Humanitarian Day must serve as a reminder of our solidarity with the millions in need around the world, and our respect of those working on the front lines of the greatest humanitarian challenge of our time.\""
