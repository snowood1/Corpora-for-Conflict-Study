      "Human  Rights Committee 22 March 2018The Human Rights  Committee today completed the review of the third periodic report of Lebanon  during which it examined measures taken to implement the provisions of the  International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The review of  Lebanon, which had started on 15 March, could not be completed as scheduled due  to a strike called for by the United Nations staff at the United Nations Office  at Geneva on 16 March.  The review resumed on 22 March with the  participation of Lebanon by a video conference from Beirut, and in the presence  of the representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United  Nations Office at Geneva.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Presenting the  report, Salim Baddoura, Permanent Representative of Lebanon to the United  Nations Office at Geneva, informed the Committee of the adoption of a new  electoral law which recognized the right to vote of the Lebanese diaspora; the  next election would be held on May 16 and would see many new candidates running  including more than a hundred women.  In the face of a massive influx of  Syrian refugees - an estimated 1.5 million joined the already large Palestinian  diaspora - Lebanon refused to heed the calls to resort to a state of emergency  and intended to remain a model in the region.  An independent National  Human Rights Commission had been established in accordance with the Paris  Principles, and a standing commission against torture would be set up as well.   A bill to protect whistle-blowers was being drafted, and Lebanon was also  developing a personal status bill which would recognize the right not to  declare religion and the right to embrace another religion, and would repeal  some outdated provisions, such as the prohibition for a Lebanese woman to  transmit the nationality to her children.  The marriage under the age of  18 would soon be prohibited, said the head of the delegation, urging the  Committee to consider the situation of the country in assessing whether the  efforts in this regard were sufficient. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Noting that it  had been twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, Committee Experts  started the interactive dialogue by praising the country for hosting more than  one million Syrian refugees and assuming a burden which strained its  infrastructure.  They commended positive legal reforms including  criminalization of torture and the new electoral law, and said that challenges  related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and  the country's cultural and religious pluralism continued to persist.   While recognizing realities of domestic political instability and the  regional geopolitical situation, Experts were nevertheless concerned by lack of  action to overcome the confessional political system and asked about efforts to  combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance.  They urged Lebanon to  address the reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and  reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including  children; improve conditions of detention, alleviate overcrowding, and  investigate abuses happening within prison walls.  While Lebanon had made  efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end had not yet  been adopted, Experts remarked.  They raised concern about the still  unknown fate of the more than 17,000 people who had been disappeared between  1975-1990, and the comprehensive impunity in this area - there had been no  prosecution relating to enforced disappearance to date.  Discrimination  against women continued as personal status laws created barriers to their  equality in matters of marriage, divorce, custody and alimony, and Lebanon  still lacked a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would include a  definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple discrimination, and  a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the Covenant.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  In his  concluding remarks, Mr. Baddoura thanked the Committee for a courteous  discussion which would hopefully represent a milestone in the cooperation  between Lebanon and the Committee. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Margo Waterwal,  Committee Rapporteur, in her concluding statement, thanked the delegation of  Lebanon in Geneva and in Beirut for their flexibility. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The delegation  of Lebanon consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, Ministry of  Defence, Ministry of Labour, Ministry of State to the Women Affairs, Ministry  of State to the Human Rights Affairs, Ministry of State for the Displaced  Affairs, the National Commission for Lebanese Women, and the Permanent Mission  of Lebanon to the United Nations Office at Geneva.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  will issue its concluding observations and recommendations on the report of  Lebanon towards the end of its session, which concludes on 6 April 2018.   All the documents relating to the Committee's work, including reports submitted  by States parties, can be found on the session's webpage.  The webcast  of the Committee's public meetings is available at UN  Web TV.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  will next meet in public at 10 a.m. on Monday, 26 March to discuss the progress  report of the Special Rapporteur on the follow-up to the concluding  observations, and the progress report of the Special Rapporteur on follow-up to  views. \n",

      "  Lebanon had  ratified the Convention against Torture and had submitted its first report to  the treaty body responsible for its implementation.  A bill to protect  whistle-blowers was being drafted, said the Ambassador, and informed the  Committee that sanctions had been imposed on law enforcement officers who had  used disproportionate violence during demonstrations.  The right not to  declare religion or to embrace another religion was envisaged in the framework  of a personal status bill, which at the moment was not unified.  The bill  would repeal some outdated provisions, such as a prohibition for a Lebanese  woman to transmit her nationality. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanese women  occupied a growing place in the world of work, including in senior positions in  the public and private sectors, emphasized Mr. Baddoura.  There was a  system in place to enable women victims of violence to seek reparations.   The law prohibited modern slavery and trafficking in human beings; a  strategy was in place to improve the border control in this context, while  bilateral agreements had been concluded with countries of origin of migrant  workers.  The marriage under the age of 18 would soon be prohibited, said  the head of the delegation, urging the Committee to consider the situation of  the country in assessing whether the efforts in this regard were sufficient. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Lebanese  State was serious about developing its capabilities and was committed to  respecting its international obligations, reiterated the Ambassador and went on  to reassure the Committee that the civil society, whose activity was vital,  could act and express itself freely.  The authorities worked in  cooperation with the civil society on the basis of shared values, he said and  concluded by expressing hope that the dialogue with the Committee Experts would  be constructive.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Questions  by Committee Experts\n",
      "  \n",
      "  A Committee  Expert remarked at the beginning of the interactive dialogue that it had been  twenty years since the last review of Lebanon, and then praised Lebanon for its  approach to Syrian refugees, noting that, since the outbreak of the crisis in  Syria, Lebanon had hosted more than one million refugees and asylum seekers,  assuming a burden which strained its infrastructure.  The Expert commended  the State party for initiating positive legal reforms such as the adoption of  legislation establishing a national human rights institution and a national  preventive mechanism for torture; the criminalization of torture and the  adoption of a new Electoral law.  Challenges still remained, however,  related to the unprecedented flow of refugees from neighbouring countries and  the country's cultural and religious pluralism. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Expert had  concerns about the status of the Covenant in the domestic legal order and  its relation with the Lebanese Constitution.  He asked the delegation to  cite examples of case law where the Covenant had been invoked before national  courts, and to explain steps taken to raise awareness about the Covenant in the  judicial and legislative milieu. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  To ensure that  the National Human Rights Institution became operative, the Expert  inquired whether members had been appointed, what its budget was and under what  mandate it operated.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanon planned  to overcome its confessional political system however no action had been taken  due to the domestic political instability and the geopolitical situation in the  region.  The Expert recalled that during the visit to the country in 2015,  the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief had taken note of the  cautious approach to preserve the interreligious balance in various social  spheres to ensure stability, and wondered whether such an approach could also  lead to discrimination in various social spheres.  What educational  measures would be taken to combat sectarian prejudices and promote tolerance?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Discussing the discrimination  of women, civil society submissions flagged the continuing discrimination  against women in the various personal status laws, for example in erecting  greater barriers for women who wished to terminate their marriage, initiate  divorce proceedings, ensure their rights concerning their children after  divorce or secure pecuniary rights from former spouses.  Had measures been  taken to ensure equal treatment of women in the personal status laws?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  What were the  plans concerning the adoption of a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that  would include a definition of direct and indirect discrimination, multiple  discrimination, and a list of multiple prohibited grounds as defined by the  Covenant, as well as an open-ended list of prohibited grounds related to social  status and gender identity and orientation?  What remedies were available  to victims of discrimination?  Lebanon should amend the Constitution to  include a minimum list of prohibited grounds for discrimination, Experts urged.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  was concerned about the reports of a rise in arrests under article 534, which were  based on physical characteristics or dress, and in fact targeted the lesbian,  gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community.  Although Lebanon had  stated that prison sentences for members of those communities were more  lenient, and even if they were only given a fine, it remained on their records  for three to five years.  Persons were harassed and attacked on the  basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, and for the most part were  not protected by the police.  Seminars to mark the day against homophobia  in Beirut, were met with threats by the Association of Muslim Scholars, which  posted threats on Facebook; rather than protecting the individuals, the  authorities cancelled the events.  What were the measures taken to protect  persons subjected to discrimination and violence, including hate speech, on the  basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity?  Would Lebanon  consider adopting hate crime legislation and abolishing article 534 completely?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Another issue  of concern was the persistence of discriminatory legal provisions and  practices which prevented women from fully enjoying their rights,  especially in the personal status law, nationality law and penal code.   Women were poorly represented in political life and legislative bodies  although there were no explicit obstacles to their participation in these  institutions. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  With regards to violence against women, what was the status of the amendment to law 239  which the Ministry of Justice had proposed to strengthen the protection of  survivors of domestic violence, and did it include also marital rape?  The  Experts also raised issues concerning sexual harassment in the workplace,  corporal punishment of children and the age for contracting marriage, and asked  about shelters for victims of violence.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  There were  reports of arbitrary arrests and detention by security forces, and  also reports of high numbers of prisoners in pre-trial detention, including  children.  Was arbitrary detention a common practice and what legal  safeguards were in place for all persons deprived of liberty?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  While Lebanon  had made efforts to abolish the death penalty, the 2012 bill to that end  had not yet been adopted.  No executions had been carried out since 2004,  however the national human rights action plan to adopt the moratorium on the  death penalty had not been implemented.  Experts stressed that the right  to demand a pardon on the particular circumstances of the case could not  replace the judicial authority of whether or not to impose the death penalty. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  was pleased to see the institution of a Prison Refurbishment program, yet there  was still a trend of prison overcrowding, with certain centres having a more  than 185 per cent occupancy rate.  Between 2012 and 2016, 81 people lost  their lives in detention centres of \"natural\" causes; hygiene conditions  remained poor and there were reports of abuse by prison guards.  Lebanon  must improve conditions of detention, take steps to alleviate  overcrowding, investigate abuses happening within their walls, and ensure that  refugees and immigrant populations were held separately.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  There were more  than 17,000 cases of enforced disappearances in Lebanon between  1975-1990, and reports of secret places of detention; yet, there had been no  prosecution relating to forced disappearance to date.  Impunity in this  area was comprehensive, Experts said, reminding Lebanon that the right of  families to know what happened to their members was enshrined in international  human rights laws.  A number of mass graves had been identified but only  one had been exhumed with the identification of bodies.  Did Lebanon have  plans to exhume the others and identify the bodies and thus give closure to  families?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The  criminalization of abortion was connected with religious beliefs  and therapeutic abortion was only practiced if the life of the mother was in  danger.  The criminalization pushed some 40,000 women every year towards  unsafe abortions at a great risk to their health, and significantly increasing  maternal mortality rates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The law  protected a person's right not to be subjected to torture or to  other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and Lebanon had  broadened the scope of legal protection by ratifying the Convention against  Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in line  with the provisions of article 7 or the Covenant.  On October 26, 2017 the  Chamber of Deputies had approved a draft act that criminalized the offence of  torture, including a definition of the offence of torture, Experts said and remarked  that it fell short of Lebanon's obligations under international law. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanese law  also contained a set of rules aimed at ensuring that prisoners were treated  with humanity.  Preventive and punitive measures had been adopted and  conditions for detainees held in Lebanese prisons were improving.  Yet  there were still concerns.  Statistics showed that 60 per cent of persons  arrested in Lebanon for over a year were subjected to torture and serious ill  treatments, 52 per cent of female detainees were also victims of torture.   Detained refugees were forced to sign a statement confirming their  voluntary repatriation to their country of origin after being tortured.   Children and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons were also  subject to torture.  What was the State party doing to address torture in  prisons?  What rights did the prisoners have?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Responses  by the Delegation\n",
      "  \n",
      "  In response to  Experts' questions related to the constitutional and legal framework, a  delegate said that the Constitution attached special importance to the  Covenant, as reflected in its preamble.  A number of judicial rulings had  invoked the Covenant on political and civil rights, for example in the area of  asylum law.  Judges and prosecutors received continuing professional education,  which included human rights training, said the delegate noting that the  bar association in Beirut held at least one session per year on the principles  and provisions of the Covenant.  In addition, four or five years ago,  Lebanese universities had adopted a decision on including human rights in the  curricula in all sectors and faculties of academic training and universities. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Non-discrimination  and gender equality was  the subject of a number of questions and comments, said a delegate, reiterating  that the Lebanese civil law drew no distinctions between men and women.   Women could take up positions on an equal footing with men, in the  diplomatic corps, judiciary and public service, said a delegate.   Religious law did not seek to oppress women; it provided everyone with  their rights while civil law covered areas not covered by personal status laws  which were based on a person's religious denomination. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Referring to  the 2014 Domestic Violence Act, certain amendments were being debated in  Parliament with a law on early marriage and the movement of minors.  With  regard to civil marriage, there was a strong trend toward adopting a law  concerning this but it was hampered because of the political situation.   The law did not recognize marriage of Lebanese citizens abroad. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The National  Strategy for Women had been adopted in 2012 to ensure their equal  treatment in all walks of life.  Looking at the law, the media, social  activism and training, efforts had been made in those domains regarding the  progress of women's rights.  There was a strategic aim to ensure equal  rights and obligations for men and women.  The Media Act raised the  media's awareness to women's condition in Lebanon.  Educational  opportunities were equal between girls and boys but there were also efforts to  integrate more women in the education system.  With regard to health,  continued the delegate, men and women equally accessed reproductive health  rights and health care. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Government  was currently amending laws that discriminated against women's economic  and commercial rights.  Many campaigns had been launched that insisted in  including women in electoral lists.  There were efforts now for Lebanese  women to pass their nationality to their children.  Procedures were being  adopted to give residency rights to spouses of Lebanese people as well. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Civil society  organizations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons were  invited to participate in activities organized by the National Human Rights  Institution, said the delegation, emphasizing that everyone had the right to  bring a legal case regardless of their sexual orientation and gender identity.   Specialized tribunals had handed down four judgments under article 504 of  the penal law.  Laws guaranteed sexual freedoms but there was no security  campaign in place to protect those individuals in the private domain.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  As for violence  against women, amendments to the law protecting women and families in a  public space, had been submitted for approval in Parliament.  Those  amendments would indeed allow for the criminalization of marital rape.   The law held that violence against women with a view to having sexual  relations constituted aggravating circumstances.  It was also compatible  with international laws and instruments.  There was a bill before  Parliament, which sought to criminalize sexual harassment in the workplace and  in the public sphere.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  A number of  measures had been taken to address violence against women, said the delegation.   Internal security forces had created a specialized centre for victims of  domestic violence to receive complaints and ensure their temporary shelter  while those complaints were investigated.  A special prosecutor for  intra-family violence was in place, and in cooperation with civil society, the  police were trained in dealing with domestic violence and the victims.   Victims of violence could always call on the support of a provisional,  secret shelter. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  A new electoral  law had been adopted in 2017 which required representation of all  societal categories with particular emphasis on female candidates. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  There was an  accelerated approach to establish human rights training in military spheres in  Lebanon.  Torture and other conflicts with international humanitarian law  cases were reviewed in cooperation with other governmental bodies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Speaking on the death penalty, the delegation emphasized that the laws governing it were  in line with the Covenant, as the capital punishment was only used for the most  serious crimes.  It was important to understand that the use of the death  penalty required a decree on the part of the executive, stressed the delegate,  noting that the death penalty had not been used since 2004.  Judges were  allowed to transmute the death penalty to life in prison on the condition that  the victim's family was informed and received reparations.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The dialogue  with the delegation of Lebanon continued on 22 March via a video conference from  Beirut; representatives of the Permanent Mission of Lebanon to the United  Nations Office at Geneva were present in the room.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Responses  by Delegates\n",
      "  \n",
      "  With regard to  questions of confessionalism, with roots dating back to Ottoman times,  the delegation said that Lebanese society was multi-denominational, with 18  different religious communities recognized by the State.  Each of these  communities has its own personal status rules that applied only to its members.   This confessional diversity was also reflected in the political system  and the distribution of certain public functions.  Faith diversity was  considered one of the guarantors of coexistence as it ensured the protection of  the specificity of each community and ensured its active participation in  governance and public administration. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  It might seem  legitimate to think that taking into account the confessional diversity in  governance and administration had the effect of limiting the application of the  principle of equal rights for all Lebanese, noted the delegate, since  confessional membership could constitute a discriminatory element among the  Lebanese.  Moreover, the State committed, within the framework of the  preamble of the Constitution, to the abolition of political confessionalism,  but it had done almost nothing in this sense, because of the political and  security instability.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Already under  the Ottoman Empire, confessionalism had ensured all Lebanese communities the  enjoyment of a certain number of rights.  With independence, a mixed -  hybrid - system of governance had been put in place, in which confessionalism  and democracy were mixed.  Community identity did not stand in the way of  national identity, stressed the delegate; when a soldier fell in the fight  against terrorism or a hostile foreign state, when a judge made a verdict, they  did not do so by virtue of the values \\xe2\\x80\\x8b\\xe2\\x80\\x8bof their confession.  The constitutional  amendments under the Ta'if Agreement represented a stability of power,  upholding the social fabric of Lebanon and the responsibility of all.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Since 2008,  every citizen could demand that the mention of his or her denominational  membership be omitted from the registers of civil status, or be  deleted.  According to the inventory of the Directorate General of  Personal Status of the Ministry of Interior and Municipalities, about 300  people had used this provision in 2016.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The criminalization  of torture had been effective at all levels according to international  law. Lebanese law recognized torture in all circumstances and stipulated  various levels of punishment which was proportional to the torture inflicted,  and it also granted courts the rights to offer rehabilitation to torture  victims.  About 60 complaints of torture had been lodged in 2017, which  resulted in sanctions for some 40 officers.  The Committee Against Torture  had been created under the Paris Principles and was tasked with investigating,  reporting, and educating about human rights.  The Committee visited  detention centres in a random fashion and spoke with detainees concerning their  conditions.  They also gathered information from Lebanese administrative  authorities and received recommendations on improving those detention centres.   There also had to be a sufficient budget to cover the mandate, which  would be part of the budget finance package of 2018. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Referring to fundamental  guarantees for detainees, community police had been adopted as part of the  \"together towards a safer society\", programme, whose goals were based on four  objectives: safety, bolstering partnerships with society, accountability and  human rights, and raising the level of professional expertise.  Members of  this body were trained and conducted programs and visited prisons, thus  developing criteria to assure the conduct of those visits.  Article 1 of  the Convention against Torture was also adopted and integrated into Lebanese  legislation, further protecting prisoners' rights, and a complaint mechanism  was in place with cameras installed to monitor detention centres.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The conditions  of detention centres, said a delegate, in light of the surge of refugees,  were overcrowded.  To cope with that increase, new prisons were  constructed in the north of Lebanon and the central Roumieh prison also had a  new centre as well as a new juvenile detention centre.  A commission to  tackle poor prison conditions was to be established as well as investigate  alternative means to confinement.  There was also the complete separation  of juveniles from adult detainees.  There were 23 prisons in Lebanon  suffering from overcrowding.  They were working on programs to  rehabilitate prisoners as well, and reintegrate them in society. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  In terms of pre-trial  detention, the legal system required that people detained for longer than  72 hours be registered, and article 47 of the criminal procedure code reminded  the detainee of their rights to contact a lawyer and to have an interpreter.   According to this article, arrested people could only be held for 48  hours, prolonged only with the accord of the attorney general.  Under  Decree 6236, the International Committee of the Red Cross could regularly visit  thirteen prisons so independent investigations could be carried out about  prison conditions and treatment of detainees.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  With regards to enforced disappearances, a delegate said that the Ministry for Human  Rights was in consultations with civil society organizations and victims'  families, while the future protocol with the International Committee of the Red  Cross, already approved by the Ministry of Justice, would enable the collection  of the DNA from family members to help with the identification of the  disappeared.  The right to knowing the fate of their family members would  be enshrined in law, while a national committee established to this effect  would have centralized archives to help detect the locations where those  persons had been buried, essentially in mass graves. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Abortion was prohibited  and therapeutic abortion was allowed only if the mother's life was at risk;  outside this scope, a judge might grant abortion under \"extenuating  circumstances\" recognize the concept of \"honour crimes\", but there had  been a provision in the Criminal Code which had allowed it.   The Chamber  of Deputies had repealed in 2011 that article which had granted extenuating  circumstances to the person killing or mistreating his wife, one of his  ascendants or descendants or his sister because of adultery or unlawful sexual  intercourse.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Questions  by Committee Experts\n",
      "  \n",
      "  In the  continuation of the interactive dialogue, an Expert said that although there  were no secret detention centres under the Ministry of Defence,  there were allegations that such centres existed, and that children were  detained, and even died there.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The labour law  excluded migrant workers-primarily women-from its provisions and placed them  under the sponsorship system, also known as the kafala, which gave  absolute control of the employer over the status of the migrant employee, and  making migrant workers vulnerable to exploitation and abuse. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanon hosted  a huge number of refugees and provided continued aid to those refugees despite  the burden they placed on the country, Experts noted with satisfaction and  asked about the regulations in place that resulted in the restricted access to asylum  procedures and push-backs at the border with Syria.  There were  reportedly 20 cases of refugees and asylum-seekers, mostly Iraqi and Sudanese  nationals, who had been deported from detention centres in 2017.  Would  the State Party adopt domestic framework for asylum or adhere to the 1951  Refugee Convention? \n",
      "  \n",
      "  There were also  reports that refugees and asylum seekers were subjected to prolonged  administrative detention and subjected to expulsion.  How many migrants,  refugees and asylum seekers were detained, on what grounds and how many among  them were children?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The mass  surveillance of digital communications by the State Party had been  reported, said an Expert, and that surveillance and subsequent interception of  personal data was not compatible with the Covenant.  Law 140 required  prior judicial authorization for any interception of private communications and  access to data but the Lebanese Prime Minister had the authority to circumvent  this Law.  The Expert asked if this surveillance was subject to  independent oversight mechanisms and if Law 140 would be amended to ensure  greater protection. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  expressed concerned about the lack of judicial independence and the  absence of effective means for appeals.  What was the status of the bill  aimed at ensuring the independence of the judiciary?  Three bills  concerning the abolition of military courts were currently being discussed in  Parliament - would they touch on the lack of the independence of judges or the  use of the courts to impress political adversaries and suppress dissenting  voices? \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The use of confessions  extracted under torture, for example, was not considered grounds for  appeal; civil society organizations documented at least eight cases where  individuals had their confessions, given while under torture, were used against  them in court. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The Committee  considered that defamation should be de-criminalized and the  criminal code be reserved for only the most serious crimes.  Provisions in  the Code allowed for imprisonment for anyone who, for example, insulted the  President or the flag, which was extreme. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  With regard to  the right to access information, the Committee commended Lebanon on  drafting that law as well as the update of a draft law that protected  whistle-blowers in cases of corruption.  The Constitution guaranteed the right  to assembly, however during some demonstrations, including the 2015  protests related to the waste collection crisis and corruption and impunity for  such acts, excessive force by security authorities had been used.  When  and how was force used by the authorities and were they trained on situations  where using force was necessary?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Experts were  concerned about numerous reports of forced marriages among Syrian  refugee girls and women, as well as rural women in Lebanon.  What were the  intentions concerning decriminalising consenting sexual relations between  adults irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Could members of  non-registered religious groups stand as candidates for election at national or  local levels and what were the opportunities for their political and public  participation?  What concrete measures, including quotas or voluntary  quotas, would be put in place to increase women's presence in decision-making  positions?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanon  continued to observe a de facto moratorium on the death penalty, but an  Expert asked for clarifications on how many people had been killed by the death  penalty. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  According to  Article 24 of the Covenant, said the Expert, all children must be immediately  registered after birth and were required to given a nationality.   Still, many children in the country were stateless at birth, particularly  refugee children.  What was being done to simplify the birth registration  procedure and what rights to nationality did children born to stateless parents  had?\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Responses  by the Selegation\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Responding to  the question about the deportation of migrants, the delegation explained  that the principle of non-refoulement was fully respected by the  authorities: no person could be expelled if there was the slightest doubt that  he or she could be subjected to torture in his country.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Regarding privacy  and censorship, intelligence interception did not interfere with private  life.  A safe Lebanon was a secure Lebanon, the delegation said, but using  this intelligence was only in the interests of fighting terrorism and  protecting Lebanon and its people. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Regarding freedom  of expression, the law stipulated that all audiovisual recordings must be  controlled.  The existence of a code of conduct that had classified  artistic works was not contrary to freedom of expression; the broadcast of  works that focused on Lebanon's diversity were encouraged and violent extremism,  terrorism and hate speech were censored.  An audiovisual bill was under  consideration, and it would repeal prison sentences that can be used against  newspapers.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Domestic  workers were  protected by the law of obligations and contracts, as well as by the Criminal  Procedure Code.  Any mistreatment or withholding of salaries by employer  could be lodged with a disciplinary board within the Ministry of Labour.   To provide fair and equitable working conditions and to protect women  from abuse and violence, the labour law required employers to give equal  salaries to migrant workers, to be paid at the end of every month through a  bank transfer or money wire.  The workers were provided with 24 hours off  and a 15-day annual leave as well as nine consecutive hours of rest per day.   A guide published in the native language of foreign workers was given to  them as soon as they arrived in the country.  Audiovisual campaigns had  been developed to raise awareness of employers concerning their obligations. Trade unions had a wide  margin of freedom in Lebanon and a prohibition against social servants to hold  a strike was now a theoretical thing.  Protests had been held in 2017 to  raise their wages, for example. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Ad hoc or military  courts had been created in 1968; they comprised 27 judges appointed by  the Ministry of Justice and High Judicial Council.  With regard to  investigating minors in military courts, it was done in the presence of a  juvenile protection delegate and they were only tried if they perpetrated a  crime with adults; otherwise they were referred to a juvenile court.  It  was compulsory to have a defence council present in military court during the  proceedings.  Defence council would be appointed if the accused could not  provide one. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The delegation  categorically denied the existence of secret detention centers and  said that facts would be welcome, not allegations. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The jury was an  independent authority and all judgements were issued in the name of the  Lebanese people, as consecrated in the Constitution.  Draft laws promoting  the independence of the judiciary were being discussed in  Parliament and focused on the mechanism to appoint judges, how to appoint  members of the Supreme Council and the budget of the judiciary. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Lebanon had for  the first time a Ministry dedicated to fighting corruption, and was  responsible for, inter alia, illicit enrichment, money laundering and the  financing of terrorism.  A national strategy against corruption was in the  process of implementation.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  Regarding birth  registration, it was possible to register a child under the name of the  Lebanese father or mother or both within 12 months of birth.  It was also  possible to register children of foreign parents born in Lebanon.  A  special mechanism had been put in place for the registration of Syrian  children, even those older than 12 months; the mechanism also covered  Palestinian refugees from Syria.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  The delegation  said that 63 people had been sentenced to death.\n",
      "  \n",
      "  A draft law on early  marriage removed the possibility for different denominations to set  their own age of marriage, which would not be 18 years old; the new law would  allow 16 years old to marry subsequent to the authorization of the parents and  social entourage.  A judicial authorization was required for the  administration to register a marriage of a minor.  The law also introduced  penal sanctions for non-compliance and awareness campaigns for young girls to  inform them that they could refuse to marry before the age of 18 was in place.\n",

      "Committee on Economic, Social  and Cultural Rights\n",
      "20 November 2014\n",
      "The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights today concluded its consideration of the third  periodic report of Nepal on how it implements the provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.Raju Man Singh Malla, Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers of Nepal, presenting the report, reiterated Nepal's unflinching commitment to respect, protect and fulfil basic human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.  There had been significant progress since the submission of the third report.  Despite unflinching commitment and efforts, Nepal had been lagging behind in full achievement of some of the targets and in fulfilling its obligations, and faced numerous challenges.  While aware that much still had to be achieved, Nepal believed it was on the right track and the privilege of an open and democratic regime always served as a platform to bring change for improvement and to rectify the wrong course of action, if any, where appropriate.During the interactive dialogue Committee Experts raised issues relating to, among others, the constitutional drafting process, the impact of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the domestic legal order; the ability of women to transfer their citizenship to their children; school drop-out rates; policies currently being implementing to end harmful traditional practices, particularly against children; the National Commission for Human Rights; bonded labour; and refugees and internally displaced persons.  In concluding remarks, Mr. Malla said that Nepal was pleased to participate in this interactive dialogue which was very motivating to adopt further measures to implement the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The Government highly valued international human rights instruments and had shown unflinching commitment.  However, it was aware that much more needed to be done despite progressive outcomes, and requisite resources were needed.  Concluding observations of the Committee would provide a practical framework to adopt a more inclusive development approach.  Maria-Virginia Bras Gomes, Committee Rapporteur and Country Rapporteur for the report of Nepal, thanked Nepal for this constructive dialogue.  It was hoped that the final constitution would come as fast as possible, hopefully by mid-January.  Nepal had come out of a painful conflict process and efforts undertaken were recognized, but normative gaps had also been signalled.  It was hoped that in the concluding observations some suggestions and recommendations on how to reduce those gaps would be found.  It was also hoped that constructive cooperation with non-governmental organizations would be maintained.  Zdzislaw Kedzia, Chairperson of the Committee, thanked the delegation for its very constructive attitude to the dialogue, which was very helpful.  The Committee had learnt a lot about the transformation process in Nepal, which was certainly facing a lot of challenges but was also already able to note significant steps forward, which was encouraging.  There was a need to cross fingers that the constitution development process would be finalized before the deadline established.  The delegation of Nepal  included representatives of the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Finance, the National Planning Commission Secretariat, and the Permanent Observer Mission of Nepal to the United Nations Office at Geneva. The Committee will resume its meeting this afternoon, at 3 p.m., to begin its consideration of the combined third to fifth periodic report of Romania (E/C.12/ROU/3-5). The ReportThe Committee is considering the third periodic report of Nepal (E/C.12/NPL/3).Presentation of the Report RAJU MAN SINGH MALLA, Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers of Nepal, presenting the report, reiterated Nepal's unflinching commitment to respect, protect and fulfil basic human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.  Nepal had been heading towards the constitution making process through the inclusive and well represented Constituent Assembly.  The political transition after a decade long armed conflict had been coming to an end, bringing more stability to facilitate peace and development in the country with considerable structural transformation.  The Government's approach to the development process was gradually taking a major shift by introducing a holistic and multi-faceted human rights-based approach in development, governance and jurisprudence.  The Interim Constitution of Nepal broadened the scope of human rights and recognised their interdependency by incorporating a bundle of economic, social and cultural rights, and by realising the fact that those basic rights were inevitable for the full enjoyment of basic liberty.Legislative, executive and judicial branches had shown genuine concerns and activism within respective jurisdiction to internalise the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the domestic system, including careful consideration of concluding observations and recommendations adopted by the Committee in relation to Nepal's second periodic report.  The Government had been working to strengthen the national human rights institutions to perform their mandates in an autonomous and independent manner. The Government had also been working closely with civil society as an actor of development and social mobilisation, particularly for the effective utilisation of local resources, awareness-raising, promotion of downward accountability and for receiving input in order to reform measures towards the full realization of human rights.There had been significant progress since the submission of the third report.  A bill to criminalise sexual harassment against women in the workplace had recently been passed.  Important bills against witchcraft practicing, and amendments to end gender based violence and to maintain gender equality, among others, had been submitted to the Legislature Parliament.  Similarly, the Government was engaging in efforts to finalise  bills to criminalise all kinds of harmful traditional practices against women, to control dowry and other ill practices, employment guarantees, and a new bill on children.Nepal had made considerable achievements such as in a gradual decrease in poverty, increase in access to education, enrolment and literacy rates, an increase in child immunization, access to family planning devises and services, a decrease in maternal and child mortality rates, efficient functioning of specialised institutions for anti-corruption initiatives, establishment of policy and organizational frameworks for the rehabilitation of freed bonded labourers, rescue and rehabilitation support for victims of gender-based violence, and fast track court proceeding to deal with cases of children and gender-based violence, among others.  Through successive periodic development plans Nepal had shown its commitment to accelerating economic growth and distributive justice for the overall wellbeing of all people.  Despite unflinching commitment and efforts, Nepal had been lagging behind in the full achievement of some of the targets and in fulfilling its obligations, and faced numerous challenges.  Prolonged political transition after a decade-long armed  conflict, weak national consensus on prime economic issues, absence of elected local bodies, energy crisis, alarming trade deficit, insufficient infrastructures, difficult geographical set-up, poor industrial relations and socially and culturally interwoven ill practices, among others, had been significant threats.  While aware that much still had to be achieved, Nepal believed it was on the right track and the privilege of an open and democratic regime always served as a platform to bring change for improvement and to rectify the wrong course of action, if any, where appropriate.Questions by ExpertsMARIA-VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES, Committee Rapporteur and Country Rapporteur for the report of Nepal, said that significant progress had been made since the Comprehensive Peace Accord of 2006, and the adoption of the interim constitution in January 2007, which had incorporated many economic, social and cultural rights.  Much of the information provided was in the future tense, or in the conditional tense.  On the constitutional drafting process, was this close to finalization?  What were the remaining challenges?  Though it included a number of guarantees protecting economic, social and cultural rights, these rights could not be effectively enjoyed as there was a lack of a legal framework.  Nor could the rights be realized without adequate budget allocations.  What was the allocation of domestic resources, and in what ways was official development assistance utilized?  On internally displaced persons, most persons displaced during the armed conflict had not yet returned to their homes.  Could an assessment be provided on the situation of internally displaced persons?  Registered Dalits continued to face great discrimination in terms of access to education, health services, land and income activities, among others.  Dalit women in particular were subject to discrimination.   What were the main obstacles in this regard?  An Expert asked for clarification on the impact of the Covenant on the domestic legal order.  Another Expert enquired whether women could transfer citizenship to their children.  Could women inherit property as well as men?  If there was equality in law, how was it implemented?  What was the system envisaged to implement the law against witchcraft practicing, if passed?  What policies were currently being implemented to end harmful traditional practices, particularly against children?  On investigation of sexual violence committed during the armed conflict, could more information be provided?  There was information that human rights defenders working on sexual violence were facing threats.  Was there awareness of this fact and what measures were there to counter this?  On the National Commission for Human Rights, this appeared not to be independent or working properly, and it was not in accordance with the Paris Principles.  Had the Government considered addressing this situation?  It was understood that bonded labour was now illegal.  Could it be confirmed that no one was living under that system any longer, asked an Expert?  What measures were envisaged to curb corruption, enquired another Expert?MARIA-VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES, Committee Rapporteur and Country Rapporteur for the report of Nepal, on non-discrimination in the interim constitution, said it did not incorporate all grounds for discrimination, such as on property and birth.  Was there a plan to broaden the grounds for discrimination in the new constitution?  On refugees, there was still no refugee law, which restricted their enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.  Would there be a bill on recognition of refugees? What measures would be put forward to deal with the high percentage of the population working in the informal sector, enquired an Expert?  There had been work to develop a national employment policy mentioned in the replies, noted another Expert.  Did that mean that until now Nepal had not had a national employment policy in place?  If so, was there a target date for adoption of such a policy?  What percent of public sector jobs were held by persons with disabilities?An Expert said that Nepal was a country with one of the highest child labour rates in the world, which was very worrying.  There were cases of 12, 14 or 16 hour working days for some of these children.  What measures were being taken to address this very important issue?  Ms. Bras Gomes, in relation to informal employment, drew attention to the particularly difficult situation of women.  Were there any targeted measures for women under these circumstances?  It seemed that bonded workers had been freed but still faced difficulties as they lacked skills and access to land.  What was the assessment of the delegation on this issue?  Women that migrated to the Gulf countries were now subject to age criteria.  Could nothing more be done in terms of bilateral agreements, rather than restricting opportunities for women in this regard?  What measures were there to protect domestic workers?  Response by the DelegationIn response to these questions and comments, the delegation said that despite adversities, Nepal had been gradually moving towards the realization of economic, social and cultural rights through constitutional, legal and institutional measures and targeted programmes, in an integrated manner.  It was hoped that in January the new Constitution would be promulgated.  Nepal was in a transition phase.  Until or unless there was a new Constitution, there would be many difficulties in applying various provisions of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The National Human Rights Commission had been developed as an independent constitutional body.  It enjoyed  structural, functional and financial independence in compliance with the Paris Principles.  Regarding anti-corruption initiatives, Nepal was now a State party to the United Nations Convention again Corruption.  There was legislation to criminalise and prevent corruption.  Specialized institutional structures had also been established, which had been actively engaged to prevent corruption.  There was a zero-tolerance policy on corruption. Gender equality in education had improved substantially and the 2015 target regarding equal access of girls and boys to primary education had already been achieved.  Women's participation in public life had also improved.On internally displaced persons,  the Government had taken many steps for effective remedy for conflict victims, including reparations and interim relief.  There had been many guidelines, policies, programmes and schemes, to integrate and rehabilitate conflict victims.  Due consideration had been given to all conflict victims.  There were challenges.On exclusion of Dalits, a National Dalit Commission had been established for the protection and promotion of their interests and rights, and specific measures had been taken.  There were obstacles however, despite Constitutional provisions and legal safeguards.  It may take time to change knowledge, attitudes and cultures deeply rooted in society.Concerning citizenship and non-discrimination against women, a mother was entitled to transfer citizenship to her children as per Constitutional and legal provisions.  Around 100 laws had been amended to end gender-based discrimination.  There were still discriminatory laws, so proposals had been made to amend 30 laws.  There was a need to implement laws and policies.  Again, deeply-rooted customary values had to be changed and there was full commitment of the Government in this regard.  On the investigation of cases of sexual violence in the armed conflict, there were problems and the issue was of concern.  There was a process to establish a transitional justice mechanism.  Once it was established, then all problems would be addressed.  It would ensure justice, reparations and other services to these victims.   On human rights defenders, every person was entitled to enjoy any rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws.  No negative action had been taken on the exercise of these rights by the Government.  If there was any threat or reprisal, the Government was committed to taking action against the alleged perpetrators.  Concerns were raised about convictions in cases of corruption, there had been very many cases that had resulted in convictions.Regarding refugees, there were no specific laws at the moment.  The Supreme Court had given a verdict and the Government was in the process of preparing a bill.  Though not party to the United Nations Refugee Convention, Nepal fully recognized the principle of non-refoulement and shelter had been provided to Tibetan and other refugees.  They were entitled to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws. Questions by ExpertsHad an assessment of Nepal's poverty reduction strategies been carried out, asked an Expert?  If so what conclusions were reached and results achieved?  What steps had been taken to ensure sustained food security and freedom from hunger in both the food surplus and food deficit districts, especially for disadvantaged and marginalized groups?  What measures had been taken to deal with the housing situation of the poor in urban areas?  Had there been instances of landless people with no security of tenure in rural areas, that had been forcibly evicted from lands they occupied? What efforts were there to raise awareness of safe and legal abortions at the community level, enquired an Expert?  Did women know that abortion had been legalized?  Had the impact of the 2014 National Health Policy been assessed?Another Expert noted the serious problem of child marriage.  What was the enforcement mechanism of the Law on Child Marriage?  With regards to birth registration, there had been information that there were 4 million persons in Nepal without nationality because of difficulties in birth registration.  Could the delegation comment on this?Was there any legislation in place prohibiting and criminalizing corporal punishment, asked an Expert?  What measures were being taken to address trafficking of women and children, which seemed to be quite widespread?  MARIA-VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES, Committee Rapporteur and Country Rapporteur for the report of Nepal, on drinking water and sanitation, said it appeared that there were programmes but that they were mostly concentrated in urban areas.  Couldn't some official development assistance be used to provide drinking water and sanitation in rural areas?  Another Expert enquired whether Nepal was going to recognize the rights of minority communities to their ancestral lands.Relating to the right to education and minority languages, this was dealt with from a protection of cultural heritage point of view.  Were there any programmes in place or studies carried out on the possibility of access to services that indigenous persons may have access to in their own languages?  Had there been endeavours to promote education in indigenous languages? Ms. Bras Gomes said drop-out rates were significant, with gender disparity.  What could be done to address this and ensure that girls in particular, stayed in school?An Expert said there had been information that some 7,000 persons had sold their kidneys, had been tricked into doing this and been exploited by brokers.  Was there awareness of this problem?  Response by the DelegationA lot still remained to be done to fully comply with the International Covenant.  To eradicate deep-rooted ill practices, there was a need for a social transformation.  This would not happen overnight and would take time.  Nepal was doing its best.  Gradual changes in society had been seen and people were becoming aware of their rights.  Once the constitution-making process was successfully completed, this would provide direction.  A census would be conducted and data would emerge as to representation of the Dalits in the civil service.  On support to freed bonded labourers, a monitoring committee had been established, with representation of civil society and organizations that were directly involved. On corruption, there was a penalty of a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment.  Additionally, there were provisions for an extra five years if high ranking Government officials were involved in charges of corruption.  Follow-up Questions by ExpertsIf a Nepali woman married a foreign man, could the foreign husband obtain Nepali citizenship, just as a foreign woman who married a Nepali man could obtain citizenship? Why did Nepal did not have a plan to ratify the United Nations Convention on Refugees, asked another Expert?Response by the DelegationAs per current constitutional provisions and the Citizenship Act, there were two types of citizenship, by descent and under naturalization.  A person whose father or mother was a citizen of Nepal at his or her birth was entitled to obtain citizenship by descent.  On acquisition by naturalization, a foreign woman married to a Nepalese man would have to submit an application form, produce the marriage document and evidence of initiation of measures to renounce the former nationality.Nepal was in the process of preparing a specific bill on the refugee issue.  Once this was finalized, then there would be more favourable conditions to consider being a party to the United Nations Refugee Convention.  Follow-up Questions by ExpertsCould more information be given on the provisions of the interim constitution and the Citizenship Act with regards to obtaining of citizenship, enquired an Expert?  Another Expert asked what happened to a child whose father could not be identified.  Did the law require that both parents be identified?Response by the DelegationThe interim constitution clearly stated that every child found within the territory of Nepal and the whereabouts of parents were not known would, until they were identified, be deemed to be a citizen of Nepal.  If a father was not identified they could still obtain citizenship, with a remark that the father was not identified.On poverty reduction, Nepal had started efforts in 2006 and implemented twelve periodic plans in this regard.  There had been a detailed analysis of poverty and Nepal had tried to define poverty as  a multi-dimensional phenomenon, of a mostly rural nature.  It had started to carry out a national living standards survey, to disaggregate data based on social groups.  A multi-pronged approach had been adopted, with activities to build capacity of persons, and implement social inclusion measures, among others.  The importance of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector in the national development process was recognized.  Poverty affected men and women in different ways, with inequality of opportunities for women.  Poverty in Nepal had been decreasing though the pace differed among various social groups and geographical regions.  It was slow among disadvantaged groups, particularly the Dalits.  Poverty reduction had been possible due to social sector investment and the implementation and effectiveness of targeted interventions, as well as the contributions of civil society.Regarding school drop outs, assessments made had shown that there were various factors that contributed to high drop-out rates.  An analysis had to be done to identify the role of each factor in drop-outs.  There was a positive correlation between separate toilets for girls and having them remain and achieve in schools. Concerning the maternal mortality rate, it was indeed among the highest in the world.  However, it had been sharply reduced and a lot had been achieved.  There would be continued focus and efforts  to reduce this further.The Labour Act guaranteed basic working conditions, with provision for maximum hours of work, facilities, holidays, wages, health and safety, as well as paid and unpaid leave, among others.  Inspections were also carried out.  The Government had been working to ensure more exhaustive favourable working conditions.  Like many other poor and underdeveloped countries, a large part of the population was employed in the informal sector.  The Government was well aware of problems faced by workers in this sector, particularly women.  On work with regard to the national employment policy, this did not mean that there had been no previous strategy.  There were labour and employment policies enacted in 2006 and sectoral policies with specific strategies and programmes to ensure employment in the country.  When the new interim constitution was adopted, there had been a requirement to enact a specific and comprehensive national employment policy.Discrimination against persons with disabilities was restricted in practice but the goal  was to eradicate it and ensure de facto equality.  The Government was making efforts to fully implement the Persons with Disabilities Act, though challenges and constraints remained.  There was also a specific act for the protection and provision of social security for senior citizens.  On child labour, the engagement of children under the age of 14 was totally prohibited and specific programmes were directed to ending child labour.  A new children's act would be drafted, as the current one was now quite old.  The age bar for migrant women was limited only for some Gulf countries, for domestic work, to prevent women from exploitation, violence and discrimination, but not for other sectors of work.    Follow-up Questions by ExpertsAn Expert was curious as to the criteria for determining poverty.  Another Expert enquired as to whether there were any plans to revise the Labour Act.    Responses by the Delegation The national poverty line calculation was based on the cost of basic needs.  It was calculated with various food items and other expenditures.  Over 70 countries in the world were also adopting this World Bank approach.  Poverty lines of the rural and urban sectors and different regions of the country were determined, and an average of these was then calculated.  On the revision of the Labour Act, yes there was a plan to revise it and a bill had already been drafted in that regard.  The Ministry of Labour was in the process of submitting that bill for endorsement.  It was believed that it would address many issues that had not been addressed by the existing one.  The Government was planning to formulate a specific legal framework with regards to food security and nutrition.  In the meantime, it had launched programmes, with the long term objective of reducing malnutrition.  Challenges were faced.  Once the legal framework with a rights-based approached was developed, then more specific programmes could be created.On forced evictions, if there was an area and land where indigenous persons resided from a long customary period, due respect of those communities was given.  When there had to be specific development programmes in those areas, the policy provided alternative accommodation.On abortion, this had been legalized since 2002.  Information about this had been massively disseminated through health facilities, volunteers, media, and by non-governmental organizations.  There was a programme for free access to safe abortions in public facilities.  The law prohibited child marriage, and child marriage had been a decreasing trend.  A fast-track system on taking action against child marriage had been established and there was awareness-raising on prevention.  Many measures had been adopted to address violence against women and the Government was working on reforming existing laws and ensuring specific safeguards for victims.  Any kind of corporal punishment was prohibited in Nepal.  Follow-up QuestionsWas the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health not the responsibility of the State?  Why was this left to non-governmental organizations?There was no recognition of unity ownership of land of indigenous people.  Would the Government make efforts to ensure that the new constitution would have such a provision?  In cases where land was needed for development programmes, was there any consultation of indigenous persons?  Response by the DelegationIt was the State's responsibility to ensure  the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Government had done this in various programmes.  Partnership and collaboration with non-governmental organizations was crucial, so there was a policy of mobilising them, particularly in raising awareness in rural areas where their presence was very much important.  The Government was planning on introducing a policy and to revise the Land Act.  The proposed policy would particularly provide for accommodation and other support for the landless.  On consultations before development projects, the policy would also cover this issue.  Right now there was no specific legislation in this regard.  There were practices of stakeholder analysis, where they were consulted and pre-informed about displacement and their inputs were received.  On International Labour Organization Convention 169, the Government had pursued a policy of creating specific structures in this regard before it decided whether to be a party to a convention or not.  Regarding recognition of traditional knowledge of indigenous persons in law, there were laws which recognized and valued traditional knowledge of indigenous persons and there were acts that specifically recognised their customary rights.  On protection of minority languages, various programmes had been organized to ensure that indigenous persons were able to enjoy their identity and culture, including their language.  School books had already been prepared in 16 mother tongues.  Concerning kidney selling, this was a big problem. Existing law prohibited selling and extraction of organs, without the consent of the person concerned.  Due to economic factors, persons were involved, particularly in rural areas, in selling of their kidneys.  Awareness-raising was taking place on the Nepal-India border in particular.   Follow-up QuestionsCould more specific information be given about indigenous languages in the official education system and any laws and good practices if they existed, asked an Expert? What was Nepal's position on ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights?  Another Expert enquired as to whether there was close cooperation between various ministries on issues to be addressed.  Response by the Delegation  Responding to these questions and comments and others, the delegation said that there were indeed mechanisms for the coordination of ministries.On the Optional Protocol to the Covenant, it was stressed that this issue had been taken as a package.  There were other human rights instruments that had not yet been ratified, such as the Rome Statute, the Third Optional Protocol  to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Protection of Migrants Workers, and the Convention on Enforced Disappearance.  As so many international human instruments had already been ratified to prove commitment, a lot of things had to be done.  Gaps were being filled.  Efforts were being directed to building specific infrastructure and enact specific laws.  Then the Government would in due course be able to declare its position.  On the language of indigenous persons, there was indeed an Act with specific provisions to preserve mother longue language, script and cultural heritage of indigenous tribes.    Concluding RemarksRAJU MAN SINGH MALLA, Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers of Nepal, said Nepal was pleased to participate in this interactive dialogue which was very motivating to adopt further measures to implement the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  The Government highly valued international human rights instruments and had shown unflinching commitment.  However, it was aware that much more needed to be done despite progressive outcomes, and the requisite resources were needed.   Nepal was actively engaged in the constitution-making process and it was believed that it was a process of national building. Concluding observations of the Committee would provide a practical framework to adopt a more inclusive development approach.  MARIA-VIRGINIA BRAS GOMES, Committee Rapporteur and Country Rapporteur for the report of Nepal, thanked Nepal for this constructive dialogue.  It was hoped that the final constitution would come as fast as possible, hopefully by mid-January.  The constitution should include all economic, social and economic rights, guarantee constitutional status of international treaties, as well as build on acquired rights.  A number of policies and measures taken had been indicated.  Nepal had come out of a painful conflict process and efforts undertaken were recognized, but normative gaps had also been signalled.  It was hoped that in concluding observation some suggestions and recommendations on how to reduce those gaps would be found.  It was also hoped that constructive cooperation with non-governmental organizations would be maintained.  ZDZISLAW KEDZIA, Chairperson, thanked the delegation for its very constructive attitude to the dialogue, which was very helpful.  The Committee had learnt a lot about the transformation process in Nepal, which was certainly facing a lot of challenges but was also already able to note significant steps forward, which was encouraging.  There was a need to cross fingers that the constitution development process would be finalized before the deadline established.  _________\n",

      "After the Commission submitted its first report to the Human Rights Council in June 2015 documenting a multitude of human rights violations in Eritrea, the Council unanimously approved - without a vote - a resolution and mandated the Commission to determine whether these violations might amount to crimes against humanity and to address the issue of accountability.\n",
      "In its final report (A/HRC/32/47) submitted to the Human Rights Council in June 2016, the Commission has concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Eritrean officials have committed crimes against humanity since 1991. The crimes of enslavement, imprisonment, enforced disappearances, torture, other inhumane acts, persecution, rape and murder have been committed as part of a widespread and systematic campaign against the civilian population. The aim of the campaign has been to maintain control over the population and perpetuate the leadership's rule in Eritrea.\n",
      "I wish to highlight some of the crimes the Commission has documented in its final report. With regard to the crime of enslavement, the Commission found that the violations relating to Eritrea's military/national service programmes include arbitrary and indefinite duration, often for years beyond the 18 months set out in the law; their involuntary nature; the use of conscripts as forced labour, including manual labour; the inhumane conditions of service; the rape and torture often associated with these military/national service programmes; and the devastating impact on family life and freedom of choice. For these reasons, the Commission concluded that Eritrean officials have committed the crime of enslavement. Despite reported promises to the contrary, the Eritrean Government has taken no steps to address any of the problems associated with its military and national services programmes.\n",
      "The Commission has also documented the extensive use of arbitrary arrest and detention across Eritrea. Detainees are very rarely brought before a judge after arrest, or tried; family members are hardly ever informed, as required by both Eritrean and international law. This enables the commission of the numerous cases of enforced disappearance and rampant torture. These acts are on-going and constitute crimes against humanity.\n",
      "The Commission has also documented various acts of sexual and gender-based violence. In military training camps and in the army, some young women are used as slaves to perform domestic duties and are also raped. Rape is also committed in detention facilities by officials and guards, not only against a significant number of women, but also against men.\n",
      "While some forms of torture are used against both men and women, other forms are gender-specific such as the beating of pregnant women in military training camps or in the army to induce abortion. Instances of sexual violence against men were also documented by the Commission, including sexual torture done intentionally to ensure that these men are no longer able to reproduce.\n",
      "The Commission found that the crimes it documented have been committed primarily, directly or indirectly, by State and ruling party officials, military commanders, and members of the national security office. The Commission has identified alleged perpetrators and has compiled files on those individuals to assist future accountability mechanisms.\n",
      "The Commission noted no material changes with the potential of impacting positively on the situation of human rights in Eritrea: there is still no constitution, no parliament where laws are discussed, enacted, and where questions of national importance are debated; the indefinite national service persists, with its adverse impacts on individual rights; there is no free press and no NGOs, except for government-sponsored ones. The population lives in fear and the government still controls their daily life, making the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by Eritreans a remote possibility. \n",
      "In Eritrea, the rule of law is not supreme. The Government and its agents must be subject to the law. People who have their rights breached must have access to a properly constituted, independent court which is staffed by professional judges who are not frightened of retribution. Ordinary people should not fear using the justice system because of arrests, detention or risk disappearance in the country's jails for doing so. \n",
      "The Commission had asked, on several occasions, to visit the country and have unhindered access to sites and locations to gather information and conduct investigations, but was denied such an opportunity by the Government of Eritrea.  The Commission's findings are based on detailed statements and information from over 833 individuals in over 13 countries, the overwhelming majority of whom have personally suffered human rights violations in Eritrea. We have been able substantially to corroborate the information provided by these witnesses. We also selected and contacted a sample of 500 individuals who wrote to us saying that our first report was inaccurate and read with care the written submissions of thousands more, all of which seemed to be part of a pro-government campaign.\n",
      "The Commission has concluded that the Government of Eritrea has neither the political will nor the institutional capacity to prosecute the crimes we have documented. The Commission therefore recommended that the UN Security Council refer the situation in Eritrea to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and that the African Union establish an accountability mechanism.\n",
      "The Commission has also asked Member States to prosecute or extradite suspects on their territories, and that the Security Council impose travel bans and freeze the assets of individuals suspected of crimes against humanity. \n",
      "The preamble of the ICC statute states that crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, such as those that we have documented in our report, threaten the peace, security and well-being of the world.  Therefore, they must not go unpunished. We need collectively to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice not only for the sake of the countless number of Eritrean victims but to demonstrate that such behaviour is simply unacceptable anywhere in the world today.\n",
      "My plea to you, Excellencies, on behalf of the three members of the former Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea, Mike Smith, Victor Dankwa and myself, is for you to pay heed to voices of victims of crimes against humanity in Eritrea. \n",
      "***\n",
      "Distinguished Delegates,\n",
      "Let me now turn to my mandate as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Eritrea. I am honoured to brief you for the fourth time in this capacity. \n",
      "When extending my mandate in resolution 32/24, the Human Rights Council requested me to follow up on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry in its report (A/HRC/32/47). I want to focus on several recommendations, some of which I have already noted earlier. \n",
      "The Commission recommended that the African Union establish an accountability mechanism, under the aegis of the African Union and supported by the international community, to investigate, prosecute and try individuals reasonably believed to have committed crimes against humanity.\n",
      "During the coming year, I intend to focus on the concrete measures that should be taken to ensure accountability for the crimes identified in the report of the Commission. Plans are still in preliminary stages, and I will report back during the next session. \n",
      "The Commission recommended that Member States and international organisations keep Eritrea under scrutiny until consistent and tangible progress regarding the human rights situation is evident, and ensure the centrality of human rights in all engagement with the State.\n",
      "Several foreign delegations, journalists, and others have recently been invited to visit Eritrea and have painted a favourable picture of the country. Some of these signs of increasing engagement from Eritrea with the international community, including with OHCHR have been duly acknowledged both by the Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea and by the Special Rapporteur. However, we have been mandated by the Human Rights Council to investigate systematic, widespread and gross human rights violations that generally take place in isolated locations and behind closed doors, in places where casual visitors, journalists and diplomats do not have access, including places of detention. Regrettably, we have not noted any substantial change regarding the human rights situation in the country.\n",
      "Since the beginning, the Government of Eritrea has refused to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur and the Commission. It has rejected findings of wide-ranging and gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity that continue to be committed to date. Without recognition of the serious situation, it is unclear how the Government will address the documented violations. \n",
      "I hope that the strengthened links with Eritrea will offer space for Member States and international organisations, including the UN and OHCHR to discuss the Commission's findings and assist the Government to devise strategies on how to respect its obligations under international law. It is my considered view that following the publication in June 2016 of the findings of the UN-mandated Commission, 'business as usual' is no longer an option. Eritrea's international partners should ensure that their engagement with the Government contributes to putting an end to the ongoing violations and foster a marked improvement of the human rights situation of Eritrean children, women and men. \n",
      "The Commission recommended that Member States provide Eritrean nationals seeking protection with refugee status in accordance with the provisions of the international law governing asylum, and the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; and to respect the principle of non-refoulement.\n",
      "Since the beginning of 2016, Eritrean asylum-seekers continue to constitute one of the largest African nationalities arriving in Europe.  As of July 2016, Eritreans ranked 8th in the number of asylum applicants in Europe and second among African countries.\n",
      "I note that the overall recognition rate for Eritrean asylum seekers in European countries remains considerable; between January and April 2016 it stood at over 90% in those European countries that receive the largest number of Eritrean asylum applications. However, I am very concerned about increasing reports of Eritreans being deported from third countries back to Eritrea, in a context where their situation upon return is not adequately monitored.\n",
      "The findings of the Commission underscore that it is not safe to forcibly return those who have left Eritrea. The Commission, in its first report, documented that individuals forcibly repatriated, with a few exceptions, have been arrested, detained and subjected to ill-treatment and torture. \n",
      "In this context, I was pleased to note the recent decision by the UK Upper Tribunal in a Country Information and Guidance case on Eritrea, which found that failed Eritrean asylum seekers of or approaching draft age who had left illegally were likely to be perceived on return to Eritrea as a draft evader or deserter from national service and be subjected to national service, and would thus face a real risk of persecution or serious harm by virtue of such service constituting forced labour contrary to Article 4(2) and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. \n",
      "I appeal to Member States to grant Eritreans access to their territory and asylum procedures. I strongly reiterate my call to protect all Eritrean asylum-seekers from refoulement and to refrain from any forced repatriation to Eritrea or to third countries where they may still be at risk or unwelcomed. \n",
      "Distinguished Delegates,\n",
      "Let me briefly lay out how I intend to implement my mandate with a view to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry over the next few months:\n",
      "\n",
      "I will identify opportunities to promote the implementation of the recommendations and advocate for taking them forward with those engaging directly with the Government of Eritrea, namely Member States with a presence in the country, the United Nations Country Team and the broader UN system, including OHCHR; I will track the progress of this engagement and report back to the Human Rights Council; \n",
      "I intend to continue my cooperation with the other human rights mandates of the Human Rights Council;\n",
      "I will follow closely Eritrea's efforts to implement the recommendations made during its second Universal Periodic Review;\n",
      "I will continue updating the international community on any changes of the human rights situation in Eritrea and hope to be able to highlight concrete improvements for the people on the ground in my upcoming reports to the Human Rights Council;\n",
      "Last but not least, I will take up any reprisals against those that have cooperated with the Commission or with my mandate as Special Rapporteur and ensure that there is appropriate follow-up by relevant mechanisms.\n",
      "The Commission has recommended that the General Assembly put the human rights situation in Eritrea on its agenda. I hope this august body will adopt a resolution with a view to submit the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea to the Security Council for a possible referral of the human rights situation in Eritrea to the International Criminal Court. \n",
      "While working towards ensuring accountability of those responsible for the serious human rights violations, I hope that engagement with the Government of Eritrea will help to make a difference in the lives of the uncounted victims and the people of Eritrea while reiterating that the Commission of Inquiry's findings no longer allow for 'business as usual'.\n",
      "I hope that the voices of the numerous victims that the Commission as well as the Special Rapporteur strived to document do not go unheard. There are high expectations that the international community will listen to their calls for justice. \n",
      "I recall one Eritrean, one of those who had the courage to share his story with us. A young man, who was clearly emotionally scarred from his experience of enslavement in the military/national service, repeated instances of arbitrary arrest and imprisonment, and the pain of having been separated from his family for too long. After describing in detail the harrowing human rights violations he had been subjected to, we asked at the end of the interview if he would want to add anything. He responded that he wanted us to tell the world what was going on in Eritrea, so that the international community would do something to bring justice to the people of Eritrea and bring an end to the human rights violations there. Today, I am here to ask you to listen to his plea.\n",
      "To conclude, I want to reiterate and reassure the Government of Eritrea, as well as Member States, that as the Special Rapporteur, I remain open for meaningful and constructive dialogue about all human rights in Eritrea; and I am available to visit the country prior to my written report to the Human Rights Council in June 2017. \n",
      "I thank you for your attention. \n",

      "19 March 2014 \n",
      "The Human Rights Council this afternoon adopted the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia and Senegal. The adoption of the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of China was postponed to 20 March in the afternoon.Bandar Bin Mohammed Alaiban, Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia, said that of the 225 recommendations received, Saudi Arabia had accepted 188 and rejected 37. The recommendations dealt with more than 12 areas of human rights, including accession to international human rights instruments, amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, upholding of the principle of public hearings, protection of the rights of migrant workers, and others. In the fight against domestic violence, the Kingdom issued a regulation on the protection of women, children and elderly from abuse, and women would participate in the coming municipal elections.During the discussion on Saudi Arabia, speakers commended the openness of the Government and welcomed the reforms, including in the justice sector. They noted the establishment of the national human rights institution and the efforts to protect the rights of women, including through the criminalization of all forms of violence against women. Other speakers expressed concern about the persisting deplorable situation of women. The newly enacted terrorism law was too vague and allowed for restrictions on freedom of expression. Saudi Arabia should strengthen its legislative framework for the promotion and protection of human rights on the ground, improve the situation of women, and adopt a moratorium on the death penalty.The Council then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia. Lebanon, Libya, Malaysia, Montenegro, Morocco, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, Senegal, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, and Egypt spoke during the discussion on Saudi Arabia.The following non-governmental organizations also took the floor: International Federation for Human Rights Leagues, Human Rights Watch, Centre for Inquiry, Indian Council of South America, Amnesty international, United Nations Watch, Organization for Communication in Africa and Promotion of International Economic Cooperation, Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, and Rencontre Africain pour la defense des droits de l'homme.Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice of Senegal, said that during its second review Senegal received 185 recommendations, of which it accepted 142, rejected 14 and postponed 19. The pending enactment of the new criminal code and criminal procedural code would align Senegal's legislation with international standards, and would considerably improve the protection of human rights, including the freedom of the press. Senegal was committed to further promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities, including their access to education, healthcare, transportation, employment, and social assistance services.Speakers welcomed the various measures adopted by the Government of Senegal, in particular the rollout of the compulsory education and universal health care and the efforts to implement policies to address violence against women, improve the conditions of persons with disabilities and tackle impunity. The rate of maternal mortality was particularly high and it was critical that the Government took action to ensure the protection of women's rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights. A speaker expressed concern that the 2004 amnesty law deprived victims and their families from their right to redress, while another called for the abolition of corporal punishment, particularly against talibe children.The Council then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Senegal. Speaking in the discussion on Senegal were Niger, Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Togo, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana and Burkina Faso.Save the Children International, Action Canada for Population and Development, Amnesty International, Comite International pour le Respect et l'Application de la Charte Africaine des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples, and Rencontre Africaine pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme also took the floor.The adoption of the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of China was postponed to Thursday, 20 March in the afternoon, replacing Israel whose outcome has been postponed to Thursday, 27 March in the afternoon.The Council will meet at 9 a.m. on Thursday, 20 March for a full-day of meetings. It will consider the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of Nigeria, Mexico and Mauritius during the morning meeting, followed by the consideration of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of Jordan, Malaysia and Central African Republic during the midday meeting, and the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review of China, Belize and Chad in the afternoon.Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of Saudi ArabiaBANDAR BIN MOHAMMED ALAIBAN, Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia, said that Saudi Arabia had received 225 recommendations which had been submitted in more than 12 human rights areas; they had been studied first by the Human Rights Commission and then by a specifically established high-level panel, by academia and by men and women. Those consultative meetings had crystallized the national vision of human rights and had led to the full or partial acceptance of 188 recommendations, while 37 had been rejected. Of the accepted recommendations, 88 had been either implemented or were being currently implemented. Saudi Arabia had acceded to the International Labour Organization Convention N\\xc2\\xb0 138 on minimum age for admission to employment and was considering accession to a number of other international instruments. Amendments had been made to the Criminal Procedure Code and the legal and Board of Grievances proceeding systems to provide sufficient guarantees to establish fairness and protect the rights of everyone. The judicial system gave great attention to the principle of public hearing which it considered one of the most important factors for achieving justice, so the Human Rights Commission continued to attend trials, together with the National Society for Human Rights and the media.In the area of women's and children's rights and the fight against domestic violence, measures undertaken included the issuance of the regulation on protection from abuse. Women would be participating in the coming municipal elections which would contribute to the promotion of their role in political, economic and social life and would allow women to participate in decision-making. Several regulations had been adopted to promote the role of civil society, and a draft project on civil society organizations was under study. A comprehensive national plan had been prepared to ensure dissemination of a culture of human rights and programmes had been launched to raise the awareness on the rights of the most vulnerable such as women, children, migrant workers, the elderly and the disabled. The Kingdom appreciated the role of migrant workers and their contribution to the overall development and so was keen to create an appropriate and convenient working environment through laws, regulations and mechanisms to define their rights and duties. The most important development in this respect was the regulation of domestic workers and the like which clearly set the relationship between the employer and domestic worker. In closing, Saudi Arabia reiterated that human rights were the backbone of the holistic development policy adopted by the State and the efforts to protect human rights revealed its determination to consolidate those rights internally, regionally and internationally.Lebanon said that it commended the efforts of and interest shown by the authorities of Saudi Arabia. Lebanon welcomed the approach adopted for the preparation of the report, which was exemplary because it grouped recommendations by heading, which made it possible to study things transparently and easily. Libya thanked the delegation of Saudi Arabia for the thorough presentation and commended its efforts in the implementation of accepted recommendations. This reflected the interaction and its positive and constructive attitude in its cooperation with the Council and other human rights mechanisms. Malaysia appreciated Saudi Arabia's transparent and forthcoming engagement in the Universal Periodic Review process. Malaysia was aware of the need for all countries to be afforded the necessary time and space in which to make improvements for the protection and promotion of human rights on the ground. Montenegro commended the openness of the Government during the process and its acceptance of most of the recommendations. Saudi Arabia was encouraged to strengthen its legislative framework for the promotion and protection of human rights on the ground and was wished all the best in the implementation of all the recommendations. Morocco said it was satisfied that Saudi Arabia was committed to pursuing efforts to protect and promote human rights by enhancing the relevant legislative and institutional national systems. Morocco also appreciated Saudi Arabia's constructive cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms as well as with civil society organizations. Morocco called on Saudi Arabia to continue working on the improvement of the situation of women. Oman welcomed that Saudi Arabia had accepted most of the recommendations, and that Saudi Arabia had already undertaken reforms in several fields, including the justice sector, to further improve the human rights protection there. Oman encouraged all States to adopt the report of Saudi Arabia by consensus. Pakistan welcomed that Saudi Arabia had accepted most of the recommendations as well as the country's constructive cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms. Pakistan particularly welcomed Saudi Arabia's efforts to establish a national human rights institution and its accession to further international human rights instruments.Philippines welcomed that Saudi Arabia had accepted a large number of recommendations, and said that Saudi Arabia and the Philippines had engaged in a bilateral dialogue on the rights of household service workers. The Philippines encouraged Saudi Arabia to continue its steps towards the ratification of international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers. Qatar appreciated the clear responses given by the delegation regarding the Universal Periodic Review. During the discussion of the report, it had become clear that Saudi Arabia had taken many measures for the promotion and protection of human rights. Qatar welcomed Saudi Arabia's acceptance of recommendations submitted by Qatar, and recommended the adoption of the report. Senegal welcomed the constructive dialogue and cooperation shown by Saudi Arabia during the review, commending the efforts of the authorities to promote and protect human rights. Senegal recommended the adoption of the report and highlighted the measures taken in relation to the protection of women.South Sudan congratulated Saudi Arabia for its election to the Council and the Government's effort to promote human rights domestically and abroad, noting particular efforts in the areas of health and education. South Sudan was pleased that Saudi Arabia had accepted its recommendation formulated during the review. Sri Lanka thanked Saudi Arabia for its constructive engagement during the second cycle of the Universal Periodic Review and the acceptance of recommendations, including those proposed by Sri Lanka. The delegation noted efforts to empower women and to protect their rights, as well as the protection of economic, social and cultural rights, and noted the clarifications provided by Saudi Arabia. Egypt congratulated Saudi Arabia for its positive approach in general with regards to cooperation with human rights international mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic Review, and this was reflected in its acceptance of a large number of recommendations, including those submitted by Egypt. Egypt recommended the adoption of the report.International Federation for Human Rights Leagues welcomed the acceptance of recommendations on access to shelter for victims of domestic abuse and measures taken for the criminalization of all forms of violence against women, but said that these would be meaningless if not followed by action.Human Rights Watch said that the Universal Periodic Review came at a time of serious concern as there were intensified efforts in Saudi Arabia to silence human rights activists. In early February a new terrorism law was enacted that contained serious flaws. It was regretted that a recommendation on religious freedom had been rejected. Centre for Inquiry said that the situation of women in Saudi Arabia remained deplorable and the lack of implementation of recommendations from the 2009 Review made the ones before them particularly urgent. Saudi Arabia was suffering gender apartheid. The cornerstone of this patriarchal abuse was the male guardianship system. Indian Council of South America commended Saudi Arabia's financial contributions to international organizations, and agreed that Saudi Arabia should continue its efforts towards adhesion to the International Covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights. It recommended that Saudi Arabia continue to place women in positions of government, and adopt legal measures to combat violence against women. It also recommended that Saudi Arabia adopt a moratorium on the use of the death penalty and strengthen the situation of migrants. Amnesty International was gravely concerned about long and systemic human rights violations in Saudi Arabia, as well as its refusal to welcome international monitoring and to ratify key international human rights instruments. Amnesty International had documented increased reprisals against political dissent. The anti-terrorism legislation was too vague and allowed for restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. Amnesty International was also deeply concerned about the restrictions on freedom of religion, as well as the use of the death penalty for juvenile offenders. United Nations Watch was deeply concerned that several countries had commended Saudi Arabia's efforts to promote and protect human rights. The truth was that there were zero human rights in Saudi Arabia, and that Saudi Arabia was implementing a gender apartheid. Saudi Arabia should have never been elected a member of the Human Rights Council. Organization for Communication in Africa and Promotion of International Economic Cooperation welcomed initiatives and progress made by Saudi Arabia to promote and protect the rights of women and children. Women occupied positions of responsibility in the public sector. The organization was still concerned by interfamily violence, particularly against women, and it encouraged Saudi Arabia to withdraw reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of Violence against Women. Organization for Defending Victims of Violence expressed concerns about restrictions on freedom of religion on the Shia population, and the new anti-terrorism law imposed the greatest restrictions on freedom of speech and granted greater freedom to the police to carry out arrests against suspects without judicial supervision. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence called on Saudi Arabia to protect the rights of religious minorities and to promote inter-faith dialogue.Rencontre Africain pour la defense des droits de l'homme recognized Saudi Arabia's accession to a number of human rights conventions and international instruments. Concerning the exploitation, abuse and discrimination of Asian and African domestic and migrant workers, and discrimination against women, Rencontre Africain urged Saudi Arabia to ratify the main human rights instruments, in particular the two Covenants on civil and political rights and on economic, social and cultural rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of Violence against Women.BANDAR BIN MOHAMMED ALAIBAN, Chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Saudi Arabia, said he had listed with attention to all the interventions made by States and civil society organizations and reaffirmed that Saudi Arabia was proud to abide by Islamic Sharia and was proud to be a member of the Council, which affirmed the necessity of protecting and promoting human rights. Saudi Arabia, abiding by Islamic Sharia, which had been chosen by Saudi people as a way of life, guaranteed rights for all people and established their obligations. The history of the Kingdom demonstrated its commitment to promote and protect human rights in accordance with Sharia, its social values and costumes and its international obligations. Saudi Arabia would continue to cooperate with the Council and its mechanisms, as well as on the basis of the memorandum of understanding signed with the Office of the High Commissioner. Concerning the role of women, Mr. Alaiban recalled the achievements made in this field and the opportunities for participation granted to Saudi women, including in education, trade and the economy. Women led corporations, were doctors, scientists, lawyers and, while the process was not finished, Saudi Arabia continued to establish institutions to allow women to live in dignity and continue to make achievements. A country's cultural diversity should be taken into account and attempts to impose certain cultures brought more harm than good. Saudi Arabia adopted 151 recommendations and noted the remaining ones.The Council then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Saudi Arabia.Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of SenegalSIDIKI KABA, Minister of Justice of Senegal, reiterated Senegal's commitment to cooperate with the Universal Periodic Review mechanism. Since its independence, Senegal had been committed to consolidate democracy and the rule of law as well as the respect for and protection of human rights. One hundred and eighty five recommendations had been addressed to Senegal during its second review. Senegal had accepted 142 of those recommendations and had rejected 14. For the 19 remaining recommendations, Senegal had asked for further delay to make its decision. Senegal wished to provide further clarifications for some recommendations among those 19. Senegal had decided to accept in principle the recommendations to ratify further international human rights instruments and to harmonize its criminal law with international standards. Senegal would soon ratify its new criminal code and criminal procedural code, which would align the Senegal legislation with international standards, and would considerably improve the protection of human rights, including freedom of the press. The press offense would indeed be abrogated. Senegal had recently undertaken initiatives to further promote and protect the rights of persons with disabilities, including their access to education, healthcare, transportation, employment, and social assistance services. Senegal was well aware of its responsibility to protect and promote human rights, and was committed to ensure that the daily life of its citizens were guided by the rule of law and human rights. The President of Senegal was committed to this vision, as illustrated by the adoption of the \"Plan Senegal Emergent\". Niger noted Senegal's efforts to accede to the relevant international human rights instruments, which demonstrated its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. Niger urged the Council to adopt the report. Republic of Moldova welcomed the various measures adopted by the government to promote and protect human rights, in particular those concerning women and children. This demonstrated the constructive work adopted by the Senegalese Government. The Republic of Moldova wished Senegal success in the implementation of the recommendations.Rwanda welcomed the delegation of Senegal and thanked them for their active participation during the Universal Periodic Review. Rwanda was encouraged by Senegal's collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner, as well as domestic measures taken to improve the promotion and protection of human rights.Sri Lanka thanked Senegal for its constructive engagement during the second cycle of the review and noted that Senegal had accepted the majority of recommendations, including those put forward by Sri Lanka. The national strategy for economic development was pertinent in this respect, as well as the commitment to ensure women's empowerment. Sudan commended the efforts by Senegal to the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly to strengthening the role of schools and the initiatives that would allow 75 per cent of the population to enjoy health and sanitation services by 2017. The Human Rights Council should adopt the report of Senegal. Togo welcomed the acceptance of most of the recommendations by Senegal and hailed the progress achieved in promoting democracy and ensuring the wellbeing of the population. Togo called upon the international community to lend support to Senegal in the implementation of the recommendations it had accepted.Venezuela paid tribute to the efforts of Senegal to comply with its human rights obligations and was pleased by the rollout of compulsory education in the country. Venezuela encouraged Senegal to continue to beef up its social policy and recommended the adoption of the report. Viet Nam appreciated Senegal's commitment to the Universal Periodic Review and the efforts to promote and protect human rights since the last meeting of the Working Group. Viet Nam noted progress made in the country in areas such as school attendance rates for girls and access to clean water and sanitation.Algeria welcomed efforts made by Senegal in standard setting and institutional measures in the field of human rights, including regarding gender equality, human trafficking and the abolition of female genital mutilation. Algeria also welcomed efforts made by Senegal for the realization of economic, social and cultural rights.Angola commended Senegal's commitment to human rights, including its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms and the ratification of international instruments. Angola wished every success to Senegal for the implementation of all the recommendations it had accepted. Benin noted with satisfaction that progress had been made, and encouraged Senegal to continue its efforts for the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly in the fields of education, health, women's empowerment, and the fight against child trafficking. Botswana welcomed Senegal's cooperation with United Nations mechanisms, including the Universal Periodic Review. Botswana also welcomed Senegal's efforts to implement multi-sectorial policies for addressing violence against women and improving the conditions of persons with disabilities. Burkina Faso congratulated Senegal on its report that had highlighted numerous good practices in the promotion of human rights and noted the measures taken in the areas of education and health, and appreciated efforts to improve the situation of women, tackle impunity and decriminalize press activities. Senegal should continue its efforts on the promotion and protection of human rights.Save the Children International said that the rollout of the universal healthcare project was a significant achievement that needed to be accompanied by the increase in the number of health clinics. There was a need for an action plan for the implementation of recommendations, particularly those related to the rights of children, and it should contain clear indicators that would ensure monitoring of progress. Corporal punishment should be abolished, especially with regard to the talibe children.Action Canada for Population and Development said that the rate of maternal mortality was particularly high and it was critical that the Government took action to ensure the protection of women's rights, including their sexual and reproductive rights. Senegal should also revisit the recommendations related to the protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. Amnesty International raised concerns about the excessive use of force by security forces in cases of public disorder and was disappointed that Senegal had rejected the recommendation on the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Amnesty International was also concerned that the 2004 amnesty law deprived victims and their families from their right to redress.Comite International pour le Respect et l'Application de la Charte Africaine des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples welcomed Senegal's efforts to implement recommendations made during its first Universal Periodic Review. It encouraged Senegal to continue its efforts to implement recommendations made with regard to violations against begging children, human trafficking and prison overcrowding. Rencontre Africaine pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme welcomed that previous recommendations made to Senegal were being implemented, and encouraged Senegal to improve access to health services. It welcomed Senegal's efforts to achieve peace in the Casamance region. SIDIKI KABA, Minister of Justice of Senegal, thanked the delegations that had noted efforts made to implement the recommendations, which was a priority of both the national authorities and of civil society. He also thanked the delegations of non-governmental organizations for their statements. The Minister then made several clarifications. It was true that the 37 prisons in the country were overcrowded, he said, but a policy was in place to address the issue which included arranging sentences by parole process. Penal Code reform now meant that provisional detention could not exceed three years, and a new prison had been constructed that could house 1,500 detainees. The State responded rapidly to all cases of police misconduct and those responsible were punished. Concerning begging, the Minister reiterated the commitment of the authorities to deal with the issue, particularly with regard to the talibe children. Measures to tackle trafficking in persons had been further strengthened. Moreover, by 2017 the authorities planned to adopt a Charter of Equal Opportunities that would support some 50,000 persons with disabilities. The Minister concluded by saying that his country had already provided answers on the issue of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons - there were laws against \"acts against nature\" in the public domain but the State did not intervene in the private sphere._________\n",

      "      I. Introduction For ten  years, the previous Government of Ecuador stigmatized and persecuted  journalists, undermined independent civil society organizations, and limited  access to information, treating the freedom of expression as a privilege rather  than an individual right guaranteed by the Constitution and international human  rights law. However, in a sharp and welcomed turnaround, for the past year the  Government has promised change. It is a commitment to which activists, lawyers,  journalists and others in civil society seem determined to hold the Government  accountable. In his remarks before the United Nations General Assembly in  September, President Len\\xc3\\xadn Moreno emphasized that rights can only be guaranteed  within the framework of solid institutions, with broad freedom of expression  and alternation in power, which are fundamental elements of solid democracies. The Government and the people of  Ecuador have a lot of work to do to meet these important commitments. Some of  that work involves legal change, and in that respect, I associate myself with  the recommendations made in the preliminary report issued by Mr. Edison Lanza,  the Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression for the Inter-American  Commission on Human Rights, who visited Ecuador in August. In other respects it  is not merely law that is required but national commitments to ensuring every  individual's right to expression: a broad commitment to implementation at every  level of government, a cultural shift inside and outside public institutions in  thinking about open government and citizen participation, and a major effort to  destigmatize and promote independent media, the profession of journalism, and  community and public media development. Freedoms of opinion and expression,  as noted by the Human Rights Committee, \"constitute the foundation stone for  every free and democratic society.\" They promote individual development and  government accountability, community protection and cultural exploration. They  enable the kind of innovation essential to sustainable economic development.  These are not privileges granted by government but individual rights guaranteed  by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  (ICCPR), to which Ecuador is a party. Article 19 guarantees everyone the rights  to maintain an opinion without interference and to seek, receive and impart  information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers and through any  medium. The Constitution of Ecuador recognizes these foundational purposes by  protecting the \"right to voice one's opinion and express one's thinking freely  and in all of its forms and manifestations\" (Article 66.6). To be sure, the  Government of Ecuador, like all States, has the authority to impose limited  restrictions on expression (but not opinion), so long as they are provided by  law and be necessary and proportionate to protect the rights or reputations of  others, national security or public order, or public health and morals. It is  also expected under Article 20 of the ICCPR to prohibit \"any advocacy of national,  racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination,  hostility or violence\". Still, it is fundamentally important that the  Government ensure that any restrictions on freedom of expression comply with  these international standards by demonstrating in each case that restrictions  are necessary and proportionate to achieve legitimate objectives.  The preliminary observations below  identify the thematic priorities that I believe are critical to achieving the  Government's freedom of expression objectives. By the spring of 2019, I will  present a detailed report to the Human Rights Council. I look forward to  working with the Government and the people of Ecuador on these issues of  critical importance to the future of democratic life in the country. \n",
      "      II.  Elimination of restrictions on freedom of opinion and  expressionGovernment officials with whom I  spoke appear to recognize that several provisions of Ecuadorian law are  inconsistent with the freedom of expression as guaranteed under international  human rights law. Even the Constitution has concerning elements, such as  Article 66.7's provision enabling \"persons wronged by information broadcast by  the media, without evidence or based on inaccurate facts, to immediate,  mandatory and free corresponding correction, reply or response, in the same  broadcasting slot or time.\" This broadly worded provision imposes an  unnecessary burden on journalists, whom I have learned are often deterred from  reporting by the operation of this rule and related implementing legislation. The Ley Org\\xc3\\xa1nica de Comunicaci\\xc3\\xb3n  (LOC), the subject of ongoing discussions in Government and the National  Assembly, contains several provisions that are inconsistent with international  human rights law. In the course of its current review of the LOC, I strongly  encourage the National Assembly to repeal, among other provisions, Article 18,  which imposes a kind of reverse censorship that imposes government messages on  the media; Article 22, which imposes the ambiguous and standardless requirement  that all information disseminated by media be \"verified, proven, accurate, and  contextualized\"; Article 26, with its innovative and problematic \"media  lynching\"; and Article 74, which enables the Government to order media outlets  to broadcast messages and reports \"of general interest\" by the President and  the executive branch, free of charge. Other significant interferences with  freedom of expression may be found in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code  (COIP), which was approved in 2014. I am especially concerned with Articles 182  and 396, which allow criminal sanctions against expressions targeting another's  honor and good name. Article 182 penalizes slander, defined as the conduct of  someone \"who, by any means, makes a false accusation of one crime against  another,\" with a penalty ranging from six months to two years imprisonment.  Article 396(1) sanctions a \"person who, by any means, professes expressions in  discredit or dishonor against another,\" with imprisonment of fifteen to thirty  days. Other similar problematic offenses exist in COIP, such as Articles 307  and 322, which provide penalties of five to seven years imprisonment for anyone  who disseminates false information that results in \"economic\" or \"financial  panic,\" both vaguely-defined in the code. Provisions such as these are bound to  have a chilling effect on those commenting on the economy or financial affairs,  such as journalists, media outlets, and academics.I identify these provisions not as  an exhaustive evaluation but to highlight the range of ways that existing law  deters expression and reporting, damaging not only to journalists and others  but also limiting the amount of information the public can receive. These  provisions are vague and, according to information I have received, they have  permitted abusive prosecution of media, journalists, and individual citizens,  for defamation against public officials, undermining the ways in which free  expression serves to hold public officials accountable. I recommend the  decriminalization of these types of offences consistent with international  human rights law.The LOC also created SUPERCOM  (Articles 55-59), a regulatory body responsible for monitoring media content  and ensuring compliance with the LOC. Under the previous administration,  SUPERCOM punished media outlets and individual journalists with fines, forced  apologies and \"corrections,\" and prosecutions. Its existence and role  undermined freedom of expression and I support the National Assembly's apparent  inclination to eliminate it. At the same time, I would encourage Government and  legislative bodies to consider, in consultation with the media and civil  society, self- and multi-stakeholder regulatory mechanisms to improve  journalistic ethics and give individuals opportunities to raise grievances in a  public but non-penal forum. As the National Assembly carries out its review, I strongly  encourage its Members and the Government to evaluate whether each provision  meets the standards found in Article 19 of the ICCPR. Such evaluation, publicly  noted, would reinforce Ecuador's move toward ensuring that it builds a future  that protects and promotes freedom of expression.\n",
      "      III. Promotion of public interest media: community radio and public  broadcastingOn the surface,  Ecuador appears to robustly protect community and public media. The  Constitution guarantees plurality and diversity in communication (Article 17),  equitable distribution of frequencies (Article 16), promotion of expression for  indigenous groups (Article 57), and protections against discrimination (Article  11.2). LOC Article 86 echoes the Constitutional guarantee, calling for  plurality and diversity of community media. The LOC also seeks to ensure that  community radio stations have access to frequencies. Article 106 established  the equitable distribution of radio frequencies, with 33% going to public  media, 33% to private media, and 34% to community media. All of this would be  outstanding if it meant what it seems to say. However, the truth and the  practice are different, and the Government -- which has recognized this concern  -- should take very significant steps to guarantee in practice what the law  suggests is obligatory. Beginning with  community radio, it appears that the 34% goal has not been reached, and  community groups believe that religious institutions have taken advantage of a  loose definition of community media to acquire spectrum to which they are not  entitled. The recent public contest for frequencies has also been criticized for  being politicized, lacking transparency, and not adequately allowing community  groups the opportunity to apply for frequencies, often because of prohibitive  costs and inability to meet the narrow application criteria. I encourage a  rethinking of how the law can promote community radio. In addition, given  claims about the nature of the past allocation of spectrum, I encourage the  Government not to enable automatic renewal of current frequencies, which would  lock in the gains made by official and private actors during what many see as a  flawed process. Instead, the law should, in my view, guarantee  genuine community media on a basis in which it does not have to compete with  private actors according to the same criteria.   Community radio, to be successful, requires government financial and  training support so that local initiatives can ensure rural and indigenous  access to information and communication. Community radio offers all sorts of  communities (indigenous, Afro-Ecuadorian, women, LGBTI, and so forth) access to  information that they would not otherwise obtain, and conversely, allows  historically discriminated people to have a voice and to transmit important  information affecting their communities. I understand, and welcome, that the  current draft of the revised LOC will encourage community radio by creating  funds to support the sector while still promoting the independence and autonomy  of indigenous communities. I share the view that the Government should remove  the 33% quota for public media altogether and instead begin the process of  developing genuine public service broadcasting. A diverse and plural media  system should include public media with sufficient economic and human  resources. Public service media are non-profit public institutions with a public  purpose: non-governmental or official, with editorial independence and adequate  protection against arbitrary interference by governments and companies. Public  service media must be accessible to all and represent the views of a wide  spectrum of political and social interests, including vulnerable groups. I  strongly encourage its development, leading ultimately to an independent public  broadcaster accessible to all people in Ecuador.\n",
      "      IV.  Promote independent journalism and the safety of journalistsDemocratic societies are dependent  upon the access individuals have to diverse sources of news and opinion. And  yet, I heard from a number of sources very serious concerns about the pressures  put on journalists during the Correa administration and the ongoing need for  improvement in the atmosphere for independent journalism. The LOC has led to  much self-censorship and, according to some, a decrease in investigative  reporting. But the law is not the only problem. The Government of Ecuador must  embrace the fundamental role played by a free press in democratic society, and  it should do so at every level -- rhetorical, policy, institutional, and legal.  I heard this kind of commitment from the President and other senior officials  during my visit, and to make it concrete,   I recommend the following: 1) \n",
      "      High level promotion of the role of journalism and de-stigmatization of  journalism: To correct the lingering culture in which journalism is  devalued, the Government should promote journalism and the purposes of a free press  in democratic society. Journalists must be able to carry out their work free  from undue influence by governmental and other pressures, and must have the  ability to adequately protect their sources. In order to ensure high standards  of reporting, the Government should encourage media training in secondary  education and in the universities, build robust media literacy, and foster an  environment of respect for journalistic work among the population. I would also  add one critical point raised by a number of journalists and civil society  activists: the Government -- together with media outlet owners -- should lead a  comprehensive effort to improve standards of living and social protections for  those in the profession.2) \n",
      "      Support for the Inter-institutional Committee for the Protection of  Journalists: The murder of three Ecuadorian journalists in April -- Javier  Ortega, Pa\\xc3\\xbal Rivas, and Efra\\xc3\\xadn Segarra -- drew stark attention to the  deficiencies in the protocols in place to ensure journalist protection and access  to information, especially by families, during crises such as kidnappings or  disappearances. I support the creation of an Inter-institutional Committee for  the Protection of Journalistic Work that would review and strengthen  protections. This group, composed of members of the State, media, journalist  organizations, families of victims, and civil society organizations, should be  inclusive of key stakeholders. It should also take  into account the specific risks faced by particularly vulnerable groups of  journalists, including women journalists and community and indigenous media  workers. The culture of acting with impunity  against journalists must end. To begin with, those journalists who suffered  attacks under the previous Government should have access to some form of  reparation, whether moral or compensatory. Moving forward, the Government  should help establish risk maps and accurately provide information regarding  potential dangers journalists may face. The Government should also collect and  publish data regarding incidents of violence against journalists. Journalists  face threats of all kinds, including violent threats on social media. The  Government must be vocal in denouncing threats and violence against  journalists, and should investigate these incidents seriously and in a timely  fashion. 3) \n",
      "      Strengthened digital security and prohibition of digital surveillance  of journalists and their sources: States have positive obligations to  protect digital communications systems against cyber-attacks and to bolster  digital safety and security for those who are at risk of such attacks,  including journalists. I have heard reports of journalists being hacked. The  Government should investigate these incidents thoroughly and impartially,  respond appropriately, and take steps to ensure it does not continue.  Journalists must also be able to use the tools necessary to keep their sources  confidential, including encryption and online programs that ensure anonymity. There have also been reports that  the Government improperly surveilled journalists in the past. States should not  conduct surveillance, including of a digital nature, against media outlets or  journalists except under the most extreme circumstances where the principles of  necessity and proportionality are met. Journalists who have been surveilled in  the past should be alerted and any files pertaining to them should be made  available to them at their request. 4) \n",
      "      Development of journalistic code of ethics and self-regulatory  mechanism: Not all of the responsibilities for the promotion of independent  media rest on the Government. Journalists and media outlets also have a  responsibility to ensure that they produce quality reporting rooted in  principles of accuracy, independence, and fairness. Journalists must maintain  professionalism in reporting by developing and adhering to a standardized code  of ethics that they themselves develop and apply, including refraining from  promoting discrimination. Journalists and other civil society members should  create and maintain a media accountability and fact-checking system, to allow  for self-regulation while building trust between the media and the public.\n",
      "      V.   Access to information held by public authoritiesDespite the fact that the  Constitution protects universal access to information (Article 18.2), I heard  repeated stories from journalists and members of civil society organizations  about the lack of access to government information. Several told me of the  difficulties that they face in getting documents from government ministries and  archives. They regularly are told that the information is subject to some kind  of exception to the Constitutional guarantee. International human rights law  protects the right of access to publicly held information, a right that is  fundamental to promoting transparency and official accountability. Everyone,  whether as journalists or members of the public, should be able to file  information requests without providing reasons for their request, and the State  should have limited bases not to disclose. The Ley Org\\xc3\\xa1nica de Transparencia y  Acceso a la Informaci\\xc3\\xb3n P\\xc3\\xbablica (LOTAIP) should reinforce the guarantee of  access to information. LOTAIP expressly states that \"access  to public information is a right of the people guaranteed by the State\"  (Article 1). LOTAIP specifically applies to the Government and defines public  information as \"any document in any format, which is in the possession of  public institutions and legal persons referred to in this Law, contents,  created or obtained by them, that are under their responsibility or have been  produced with State resources\" (Article 5). When information is made  \"reserved,\" it should be done so explicitly and transparently, and in line with  international human rights principles of legality, necessity, and  proportionality in each case. I am pleased to learn that an active  transparency monitoring mechanism has been implemented this year, aiming toward  compliance with the standards set forth in Article 7 of LOTAIP,  which requires the Government to provide  information via website regarding government institutions, such as their  financial information. I also welcome the announced resolution, championed by  the Defensoria del Pueblo, that will be issuing general guidelines for dealing  with requests for access to public information. It is important that the  various government bodies have a standard process to respond to access to  information requests in a manner which is compatible with international human  rights. In tandem with such processes, government agencies should ensure full  training of civil servants about the need to be responsive to requests for  information.I also understand that Ecuador does  not protect whistleblowers as a matter of law or practice. The Government  should protect any person who discloses information that he or she reasonably  believes, at the time of disclosure, to be true and to constitute a threat or  harm to a specified public interest, such as a violation of national or  international law, abuse of authority, waste, fraud or harm to the environment,  public health or public safety. I was encouraged to learn during my visit that  the Government will be including whistleblower protections in a proposed  anti-corruption law. \n",
      "      VI.  Protection of rights onlineEcuadorians who have access to the  Internet generally do not face the blocking or filtering of content. Moreover,  the Moreno administration appears to have firmly turned away from the previous  administration's efforts to restrict and punish online activity. The Government  should reinforce the current apparent policy of avoiding using the Internet to  attack critics by committing to at least two legal norms: (1) disabling  official actors from using copyright law in attempts to limit the dissemination  of government and other public information and reporting; and (2) limiting the  requests to Internet companies for the takedown of content to the narrow  restrictions available under Article 19(3) of the ICCPR. There are also institutional issues  that Ecuador will need to address in order to ensure a future of non-discrimination  for content and content-providers, all of which is for the public's benefit.  Presently, for instance, the regulatory body responsible for Internet issues,  ARCOTEL, is a subsidiary body of the Ministry of Telecommunications, with its  directors appointed by the President. To ensure against claims of  politicization, the government should reform the Telecommunications Law to  ensure ARCOTEL's independence, clarifying its position as an independent agency  and ensuring multi-stakeholder roles in appointing its directors. There is also  a distinct lack of clarity concerning the Government's commitment to network  neutrality, which is protected by law but also left uncertain by Article 64 of  the Telecommunications Act, which enables various tariff plans by Internet  service providers.I understand that there is a  proposal for a data protection law, that could further protect the rights to  privacy and freedom of opinion and expression. Currently, the right to personal  data protection is guaranteed by Article 66.19 of the Constitution. The new law  on data protection should be consistent with international standards, and I  look forward to reviewing a draft when it becomes available. \n",
      "       \n",
      "      VII. Promotion and protection of civil society organizationsEcuador has regulated civil society  organisations according to executive decrees. Executive Decree 016 allowed for  broad and problematic government power in the intervention and dissolution of  civil society organizations. Several problems remain in a successor decree,  particularly in regard to the definitions of when the government can dissolve  an organization. Pending legislation currently before the National Assembly  would remove the regulation of civil society organisations from the Executive  branch of government, and would instead establish legal protections for civil  society organisations and place them under the auspices of the Council for  Citizen Participation. \n",
      "       A pending draft Law on  Non-Profit Organizations would enact provisions regarding the creation and  dissolution of civil society organizations, eliminating the kind of arbitrary  government decision-making permitted by executive decree. Under this law, civil  society organizations would not need the approval of the Executive or any other  entity belonging to the executive branch of the government for their  establishment, operation or dissolution. Additionally, civil society  organization operations would be overseen by the Council for Citizen  Participation and Social Control, also subject to pending legislation, which  would have limited powers to declare the dissolution of a civil society  organization. Civil society organizations also would not need to provide  information about their operations to any entity in the executive branch. \n",
      "      VIII.    Background to the visitAt  the invitation of the Government, I spent the week of 5 - 11 October in Ecuador  in order to assess freedom of expression in the country. The visit has taken  place as part of my mandate, by appointment of the UN Human Rights Council, to  assess the Government's protection and promotion of the right to freedom of  expression under international human rights law.I  would like to thank the Government of Ecuador for inviting me to undertake this  official mission, as well as for its cooperation in arranging official  meetings. During my visit I met with President Len\\xc3\\xadn Moreno, Minister of Foreign  Affairs Jose Valencia, Minister of Telecommunications Guillermo Le\\xc3\\xb3n Santacruz,  acting Minister of Justice and Human Rights Paul Granda, the Secretary of Communication  Andres Michelena, the Under Secretary of Citizen Security of the Ministry of  Interior, the President of the National Court, the Prosecutor General, Attorney  General, the acting Ombudsperson, the transitory Judiciary Council, the  National Assembly,  the Commission of  Collective Rights of the National Assembly, the Executive Director of the  Regulation and Oversight Agency (ARCOTEL), and the President of the Council for  Regulation and Development of Information and Communication (CORDICOM),  and the Council for Citizen Participation and  Social Control, among others.  I  would also like to thank all the journalists, lawyers, academics, civil society  representatives and members of the diplomatic community who met with me,  providing detailed information about the situation in the country.\n",

      "20 October 2015 The Human Rights Committee yesterday and today considered the second periodic report of Greece on its implementation of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The report was presented by Kostantinos Papaioannou, Secretary-General for Transparency and Human Rights of Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights, who said that Greece had made remarkable progress in some areas, but a lot remained to be done. He highlighted three main challenges and areas where the Government's efforts were focused: the impact of austerity measures on the enjoyment of human rights; the urgent need to address the refugee/migration issue; and the strengthening of laws and policies against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. \n",
      "In the interactive dialogue that ensued, Committee Experts raised concerns regarding the rights of migrants and refugees, including their right to non-refoulement and the provision of basic needs and services in order to ensure their dignity. In that respect, they underlined the need to improve first care services and facilities, the need to address police violence, and steps to increase legal entry. Experts were highly concerned about the rise of hate speech among political and religious leaders, as well as media. They also inquired about the disproportionate impact on women and persons with disabilities of the crisis and austerity measures, and expressed concern regarding the independence of the National Commission for Human Rights. Several Experts raised the issue of the non-recognition of the ethnic \"Macedonian\" and Turkish minorities, and expressed serious concern regarding the violation of their right to freedom of association. Dheerujlall Seetulsingh, Vice-Chairperson of the Committee, in his concluding remarks, said the dialogue had been very frank, and the delegation had conceded that there were certain difficulties. The Committee expected a genuine response to the questions in the future and not reiteration of the replies in the report. Mr. Papaioannou, in concluding remarks, said in the following months a number of measures were going to be implemented with regard to respect of human rights. He expressed his gratitude for the fruitful exchange of opinions.Greece's delegation included representatives of the Ministry of Justice, Transparency, and Human Rights, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior and Administrative Reconstruction; Ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs, Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Social Solidarity, and the Mission of Greece to the United Nations and other International Organisations in Geneva.

Presentation of the ReportKOSTANTINOS PAPAIOANNOU, Secretary-General for Transparency and Human Rights at the Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights of Greece, said that during the previous six years, Greece had been experiencing a severe economic crisis, an extreme example of the broader crisis affecting many European countries. The policy aimed at responding to the crisis included to a large extent extreme austerity measures. The impact of the economic recession had been significant, resulting in social upheavals and threatening social cohesion. The National Human Rights Commission had underlined in a recent statement in July 2015 the importance of the Human Rights Impact Assessment and reiterated that austerity measures strengthened extremist and intolerant elements and undermined the democratic institutions. The recently reelected Greek Government would strive, while implementing the latest financial assistance agreement, to protect the rights of the most disadvantaged segments of society and vulnerable groups. In March 2015, a law had been adopted to ensure basic goods and services to persons and families living under extreme poverty conditions, through provision of free electricity, rent allowance and food stamps. One of the most pressing challenges for European countries, including Greece, in the recent months, was migration, which had reached unprecedented levels. An increase of the influx of migrants and refugees of over one thousand percent been detected in 2015 as compared to 2014, with almost 400,000 new entrances as of August. Greece and its citizens had responded at all levels, however means were insufficient and facilities were overstretched. Some of the efforts included the construction of temporary accommodation. A new Asylum Service and a new Appeals Authority had been established and operated by civil and not police personnel. Relevant procedures had been significantly accelerated and the recognition rate of refugees and beneficiaries of subsidiary protection increased. First Reception Centers had been created and were implementing a new system for registration, assessment, determination of identity and country of origin, medical screening an psycho-social profiling of third country nationals. They provided health care and psychological treatment to unaccompanied minors, and referred them to the Prosecutor for appointment of a guardian and placement in an open accommodation facility. However there were not enough reception centres. The institution of guardianship did not function in an effective and efficient manner, and was under review. Alternative measures to detention were also being implemented. No country could deal with such an international and humanitarian crisis on its own. International cooperation and burden sharing were needed to ensure respect for the human rights of all migrants and refugees. The third point raised by Mr. Papaioannou was the alarming increase of organised violent racist attacks, mostly, but not only, against foreigners, in particular during the period 2012-2013. Extremist organizations or individuals had attempted to take advantage of several factors, including the discontent of parts of the society. After the killing of Pavlos Fyssas by members of Golden Dawn, the authorities had reacted decisively to end such extremist acts. Relevant laws and policies had been adopted. The new 2014 anti-racist legislation punished, inter alia, public incitement to acts or activities which could result in discrimination, hatred or violence against individuals or groups defined by reference to race, colour, religion, descent, national or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability; the establishment or participation in an organization or union of persons systematically pursuing the commission of the abovementioned acts, and the malicious denial or trivialization of genocide. Special provisions for victims had been put in place in order to encourage reporting of racist crimes, and severe penalties had been introduced. Parliament could suspend state financing of political parties whose leaders or officials were suspect of and provisionally detained for racist crimes. Two new police sections and 68 offices had been established with the tasks of investigation of acts of racist violence, and two special prosecutors for racist crime had been appointed. Questions by Experts On the issue of incorporation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights into domestic law, an Expert asked the Greek delegation to cite specific cases since the latest report in which the Covenant and the views of the Committee had been invoked to provide remedies or to dis-apply domestic legislation. Could the delegation provide a clear answer on what procedures existed for implementing views of the Committee after they were rendered? Was any specific State agency responsible for implementing the views? With respect to the issue of re-opening criminal cases, the State party had maintained that no such possibility existed. However, at the same time, the State party had maintained in front of the European Court of Human Rights that when the applicant was informed that the case had been closed, he should appear before the public prosecutor in order to testify and request reopening of the case. Clarification was sought.Regarding civil remedies could the delegation explain the claim made in the Georgopoulous proceedings, that the author could not claim a remedy from the State but from the municipal authorities? How did that comply with the international obligation of the State to provide remedies? The Expert was concerned that in the Georgopoulos case the local court had not only found no criminal responsibility, but had actually rejected the Committee's position that the evictions had been illegal, which was why the person was not entitled to any form of reparation. Were administrative remedies under Article 105 of the introductory law to the Civil Code not dependent on a prior finding of illegality? Question was asked about measures taken to ensure that the Greek National Commission for Human Rights was provided with adequate financial resources for its effective functioning and full compliance with the Paris Principles. Another Expert said that statistical data was needed in order to measure the impact of projects promoting women. More specifically, could the delegation provide the number of women in political life, especially after the most recent elections? How many female Governors, Ministers, and General Secretaries, were there? How many female members were there in the boards of the public power company and water company? Had the Government considered the impact of the austerity measures on the most vulnerable groups?The Expert commended the Reconciling Work and Family Life Programme and asked if it would be continued. What was the result of the implementation of the special four-year employment promotion programme? What was the impact of the implementation of the programme for social inclusion for vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities? What was the number of persons with disabilities? How many were unemployed? The Expert commended Greece on special measures for the transportation for pupils with disabilities. However the Committee had information that only 15 percent of children with disabilities in Greece went to school. Could the delegation provide numbers of pupils with disabilities? The report stated that there was a limited use of restraining methods. However, the Committee had received information that the use was so high that there had been several incidents of deaths caused by fire in which persons had been restrained and could not flee. There were also reports that children being locked up in institutions. Could the delegation elaborate? Another Expert asked for clarification regarding hate speech and gender identity in the laws. The Expert expressed concern that the issues of the use of force by the police which had been prevalent in the 1960s and the 1970s had not been eradicated after the end of the military dictatorship. The problem seemed to be failure of prosecutors to investigate issues of police violence. What was the reason for that?Another Expert asked about steps to combat racism and xenophobia and to ensure that all crimes were investigated and all perpetrators, including law enforcement officers, were punished. Was it true that most racist acts were not being complained against because of the lack of trust in authorities and safeguard mechanisms? In spite of all the commendable efforts, racist attacks against migrants, refugees and foreigners persisted in an alarming manner. Hate speech was not only used by extremist groups, but was widely used by the media as well as public personalities. The report indicated that trafficking in persons had started to recede in 2010, which could be due to the fact that smugglers might had selected other routes. How had such a conclusion been reached? What were the enforcement procedures regarding trafficking, in particular of children, as well as Roma persons? What was the number of cases that had been decisively sentenced? There was also alarming information on the employment of migrants in the agricultural sector, which amounted to servitude. The prosecution in the case of the death of almost 30 Bangladeshi workers had not been commensurate with the crime committed. How did the Government intend to address such inhumane phenomena?Another Expert inquired about the respect of the rights of Roma. What was the implementation of the project Education of Roma Children? Cases of exclusion of Roma from schools, and the rise of ghetto schools remained serious. The cases of eviction of Roma in several areas of Greece were often the result of discrimination of Roma in the area of property rights. Violence against women and domestic violence was raised by an Expert, who asked about a new law to fight domestic violence adopted in 2006. However, the number of domestic violence cases had not significantly decreased. What were the difficulties? Were female victims often denied effective acts to justice? The delegation was asked to provide statistics related to the number of complaints received, investigations carried out, types of sentences pronounced and penalties served. How many services and shelters were available, and what number of women and girls were in them? More specific information regarding the criminal mediation procedure for domestic violence was requested. Another Expert commended the work of the State with respect to efforts to address racism and xenophobia, and specifically with regards to migrants. Could the delegation elaborate on the measures the State party was talking to make the migrant population aware of the new services? An Expert noted, with regard to individual communications, that the report said that the Covenant was an integral part of domestic law. Yet, there was a heavy burden which rested on the author of the communication who would have to start a case anew, in order to bring the case to the attention of the Committee. Should there not be a faster procedure for the author to communicate the violation in front of the Committee? Replies by the DelegationThe delegation noted that avenues for reparation were provided. Among those was bringing to justice of alleged violators of human rights. The obligation of the State was of a procedural character. To establish the criminal responsibility, a court had to have subjective elements, such as the intention of the alleged perpetrator. Those were issues which could not be dealt with by international bodies, which were not first instance courts. Of course, national bodies had to take into account views of the Committee.The courts were competent to decide on the compensation taking into account views of the Committee. Until now the courts had not had the opportunity to consider a claim and it was premature to question a procedure which had never been utilized. Persons who considered they had the right to compensation from the State could lodge a complaint to the Legal Counsel of the State. Concerning the question on the application of the Covenant in the national legislation, the delegation explained that Greek courts of all instances systematically referred to International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The provisions of the Covenant were frequently evoked by the prosecutors and the courts, especially in advisory opinions. Racist violence persisted, but attacks were less numerous and did not have the form of organized militia that they had three years earlier. There still existed smaller groups and individuals who committed violent crimes. Incitement of violence on the basis of racism was criminalized in the new legislation. Every effort was being made to criminalize racism and xenophobia, however, entailed curtailing freedom of expression. Hate speech was admittedly used by public figures, including certain politicians, religious figures and the media. However, the official language of the Greek Orthodox Church was far from that. What was worrying was that people had gotten used to it, and considered it natural. The parliamentarian presence of a large and growing neo-Nazi organization, Golden Dawn, which gained seven percent of votes, constituted a new challenge for the democracy. State funding had stopped for Golden Dawn. The State trials of 17 Members of Parliament was one of the biggest in the history of Greece.Accountability deficiencies existed in a structural sense and the everyday practice. The Greek Ombudsman would play a key role in combatting that. There was political will for accountability and a clear commitment to face far right groups. Gender identity was a category include in hate crimes. Regarding the March 2014 case of death by torture where 17 prison officers had been involved, criminal procedures had been lodged against all of them, and were still pending. There were five more cases on disciplinary proceedings in five different prisons, lodged since 2010, and they also were pending. One additional incident had been relayed, but no investigative or criminal proceedings and been instituted. Regarding the Roma, the delegation said that housing was a very complex issue and there were no easy solutions. Constructive attitude of all those involved was needed. After the completion of the Roma Strategy, Roma had been asked to express their opinion. In 2015, 17 million euros from European and national funds had gone towards reconstruction purposes for 20,000 beneficiaries. A mapping tool had been established on the settlements and their needs. Regarding the Halandri case, courts had recognized the rights of original owner, and local authorities and administration were coping to find a viable solution. The process of the implementation of the Programme Education of Roma Children had been very important. It aimed to reduce school drop outs of Roma children and improve access to education by the Roma in at least 84 municipalities. The specific conditions in which Roma children often lived had been taken into consideration. A particular emphasis on pre-school education and early enrollment in primary school was placed. Roma school mediators were implemented to improve access. Polygamy was banned in Greece, the delegation said. The legal minimum age to enter marriage was 18. Exceptions were allowed by courts, only in specific issues and after hearing the families concerned. Regarding the impact of crisis and impact of austerity measures, the delegation said that there was a law that aimed at the immediate relief of people facing extreme poverty. In addition, a programme providing income support, access to goods and services and support for reintegration in the market was enacted. Women were one of the groups that benefited from those schemes. The Programme Reconciling Work and Family Life would be continued, the delegation informed.Greek legislation did not allow for discrimination on remuneration between men and women. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value was guarded by the Constitution. According to research, however, women were being paid 15 percent less than men for the work of equal value. A monitoring mechanism had been established to monitor that, based on the Beijing Platform for Action. Regarding the participation of women in public life, the delegation said that the Parliament had had a female Speaker until the recent elections, and the President of the Supreme Court, who had served as an interim Prime Minister, was also a woman. The General Secretariat for Gender Equality had intensified steps to increase participation of women, but in reality problems remained. The results from the recent elections were not different. Out of 46 members of the Government, only six were women. Of 300 Members of Parliament, 56 were women. There was a law which prohibited indirect discrimination on grounds of sex, harassment, pregnancy, and less favorable treatment in matters of employment. Concerning victims of discrimination, access to justice in court and judicial protection was provided. The right to an appeal against an administrative body was provided. Free legal assistance was provided for victims of discrimination with low income, who were exempted from fees. A Consultation Handbook on Sexual Violence had been published. Trafficking in human beings was still classified as a rare crime, due to the evasive nature of the problem and many new trends. The number of identified perpetrators was decreasing, and many criminal rings had been dismantled. However, organized crime was going towards less coercive communication and taking advantage of the internet and social media networks. Traffickers relied on psychological exploitation such as granting a day off or providing cash, rather than force. Victims were thus less inclined to complain. On the national level, intensive efforts had been undertaken, but difficulties remained. The main challenge was with developing training in the first reception services, speeding up accountability and enhancing the collection of data. Regarding the question on the protection of rights of persons with mental disabilities, the delegation explained that physical restraints were used in limited and rare cases, as a safety measure to protect patients. The case of the three persons who had died in a fire while restrained was being investigated. Gender-based violence remained hidden and was considered a family issue. To reverse that, an awareness raising campaign had commenced. There were 21 shelters, and the help line had received over 20,000 calls. Over 1,000 prosecutions and 307 convictions for domestic injury had been recorded in 2014. There was no need for the explicit inclusion of rape as a form of torture. Regarding access for persons with disabilities, inspection was compulsory for every project applying for a building permit, and sanctions were imposed on engineers if plans did not comply. The delegation stated that the Committee's figures on children with disabilities and their access to education were not official figures and had been taken from a PhD thesis. The country was aware of the lack of statistics and an electronic database had been created.The National Commission on Human Rights was struggling for financial autonomy, but that did not have an effect on its independence. Questions by ExpertsWhat was the actual state of implementation and the responsibility of the State to ensure that remedies became a reality? The answers were not clear and had alluded to opportunities for effective remedies that existed but had never been used. It was harsh to have a victim go through all the stages of the legal system once, approach the Committee and obtain a favorable decision, and then have to invoke a multiplicity of proceedings which might or might not work. It was unclear whether the imposition of fees on those seeking to file a criminal complaint did not deter victims from pursuing their cases. That concern was grave in relation to appeals on prosecutorial decisions not to file criminal cases, where the fee was 300 euros. It was also difficult for the Committee to accept the need to pay a 50 euro fee to join as a civil party mot criminal proceedings. How did the State ensure that those fees did not serve as deterrents against claimants? What was the state of play of the recommendations on the re-decriminalization of petty crimes and breaches of administrative law, reduction of litigation costs, reforms in legal aid, and improved access to justice in refugee cases?Regarding practices of push-back, an Expert asked the delegation to update the Committee on the investigation of two cases, namely the Praggi case of 2013 and the Farmakonissi case of 2014, both of which had been highlighted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. There were non-governmental organisation reports of cases of confiscation or dumping into the sea of papers, cell phones, and other personal items, beating of migrants with electronic truncheons. Was the delegation aware of those reports and could it comment on those allegations? Were electric truncheons in use by the Coast Guard or the Navy, and did the Coast Guard have a place in procedures to disable sea vessels used by migrants so as to prevent them from entering the Greek territory? The numbers of complaints were too high to ignore. The Committee had received information suggesting that non-governmental organisations representing minority groups had not been involved in the consultation process of the drafting of the report. Could the delegation provide an explanation?Another Expert inquired about the situation of prisons in Greece. No information had been received on conditions in health care services and the lack of human resources in certain prisons. Did the Government plan to separate preliminary detention and pre-convicted individuals in prisons? A special rapporteur had recently drew attention to upholding the human rights of asylum seekers. Individuals found themselves in danger of refoulement. The delay of processing a file for up to 18 months was still in practice and could not be appealed. Did the Government plan to change the system in order to counter those problems? What measures did the State party intend to take to improve accommodation facilities? What was being done to address the issue of stateless refugees? In the case of unaccompanied minors, was the Government looking into adopting a system allowing people to access European territory legally instead of becoming victims of traffickers? Detention of unaccompanied minors was of high concern. Greek legislation did not prohibit this. According to the information received, detention was practiced and minors were placed in so-called special places. What was the State Party planning to do in that regard? What were the procedures to establish the age of minors? With regard to guardianship, were there alternative practices? On police custody, another Expert highlighted that the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture had noted that the vast majority of those detained by police did not have access to a lawyer during the first two hours. What kind of action and thought had been given to the reactions and recommendations of the Committee on the Prevention of Torture, in particular the recommendations to video-record interrogations?Another Expert described as impenetrable answers in the report to the question of the non-registration of associations of \"Macedonian\" and Turkish communities. The report stated that \"Greece does not recognize that a distinct national, ethnic or linguistic minority exists in its territory by the name 'Macedonian'.\" The Expert said that this was not a question of ethnic or minority rights, but a question of freedom of association. Individuals belonging to those minorities should not be denied the right, in community with members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to practice their religion and speak their language and the existence of an ethnic, religious or linguistic minority in a given State party did not depend upon a decision by that State party but required to be established by objective criteria. What were the objective criteria in question? Regarding conscientious objection, according to information received, in many cases, the duration of civil service was more than double the duration of military service. Could statistics be provided? Why were men of Greek citizenship, who had already served in other countries, obliged to serve in the Greek military? Was Greece party to the European Convention on Nationalities, under which dual nationals were not subject to military service in more than one country? There was serious concern regarding the criminalization of conscientious objectors and repeated punishments for the same act of refusing military service. There was also a serious concern regarding the excessive use of force by police during demonstrations and failure to protect media and demonstrators from extremist groups such as Golden Dawn. The sense of impunity was still deeply rooted and had been denounced repeatedly by civil society. What measures were used to suppress those acts by the police? Amnesty International had reported that over the previous t three years, escalation of attacks against migrants, Roma, and members of the lesbian gay bi-sexual and trans sexual community. Was that true? With respect to the issue of migrants who had lost their lives at sea, what was Greece doing to ensure that migrants did not resort to life-threatening routes? What steps was it taking to increase legal entry and processing in order to reduce resort to dangerous routes. Was it facilitating land routes from Turkey? Was it considering establishing a border facility there?Unregistered migrants had been prohibited transit to islands. Was that still the case? Was the State ensuring that migrants could expeditiously reach centers off the islands? Replies by the DelegationThe delegation stated that there was a serious crisis going on which had to be taken into consideration. No country could have been ready for what was happening in Greece.Regarding the asylum system, the delegation stressed that not all people were asylum seekers. Almost 80 percent had a refugee profile, but they did not seek asylum in Greece, and most did not even want to stay in Greece. The burden on the asylum system of Greece was heavy. It was not an issue of Greece only, but of European and international. It was a test for the core values of society today. The reactions of Europe had been xenophobic. Pressure on Greece to guard its borderline was worrying. Greece was guarding its borderline, but not forgetting its international obligations and the Geneva Conventions. It would continue to do both but not one at the cost of the other.Safe entry points was a European issue, not one that only one country could decide upon. There were ongoing negotiations within the European Union and of the European Union with other third countries regarding safe entry points. The Appeals Committee's work was independent. Issues of allegations of police or coast guard violence against people who were trying to enter Greece dated to 2012 and 2013 and were not recent. If there were such cases, it was of utmost importance that they were investigated. The protection of unaccompanied minors was a matter of priority for the Greek State. There was a new management system in place. Upon arrival of unaccompanied minors, first reception procedures were applied, including identification, medical screening, psycho-social support, and referral of unaccompanied minors to the relevant authorities. Minors were told their rights, and given the choice to stay at the reception centre or mobile unit. They were provided with footwear, clothes and other basic items. Where first reception centers were unavailable, unaccompanied minors were referred to prosecutors for minors or, if those were not available, to geographical prosecutors. A new mechanism was being designed of appointment of guardians. Guardians had specific duties and obligations by law. The Government had undertaken a holistic approach with respect to unaccompanied minors. The National Plan on the Rights of the Child had been drafted in that respect. There was a project to upgrade the system in order to distinguish between unaccompanied and accompanied minors. Recent measures had been taken on the application of detention measures as a very last resort. Concerning the alternative measures, the police was responsible for administrative measures of detention. New detention centres had been created. Those measures had been commended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance. Responding to the questions on the conditions of detention, it was explained that, due to the lack of proper facilities during the influx, migrants had been detained in border police stations. As a rule, migrants under return procedure were not detained in police stations. When absolutely necessary, migrants were detained for up to a maximum of five days. The information sheet on return procedures and other important information had been translated to multiple languages.The number of individuals in remand detention had halved between 2013 and 2015, form over 4,000 to over 2,000. Numbers of pre-trial detainees had also decreased. On the issue of pushbacks, the delegation said that disciplinary sanctions had been invoked. However, the anonymity of victims made it difficult to investigate those cases. The issue of freedom of association was not a matter of discrimination, the delegation said. Regarding the questions on minorities, the delegation explained that in Greece only one group was qualified as a minority, namely the Muslim minority, with three distinct groups having the Muslim religion as their common trait. That was based on the Treaty of Lausanne, but also on the assessment of objective facts and criteria and implementation of modern treaties. At the same time, the principle of self-identification was fully respected. But the decision of the State to recognize a group as a minority and to grant them additional rights had to be based not only on subjective claims of numerically small groups, but also on the objective criteria. Those were of legal, cultural linguistic, historical and ethnological nature. On the issue of the \"Macedonian\" community, it was explained that there were over 2.5 million Greeks who lived in the northern Greek region of Macedonia and who used the adjective \"Macedonian\" to denote their regional and/or cultural provenance and not a distinct ethnic identity. Those circles promoting the existence of a so-called \"Macedonian\" minority in Greece were supported by a political party in Greece which had obtained in the most recent elections in which it participated - the 2009 elections for the European Parliament - some 4,500 votes, or 0.1 percent of the votes. That dismissed any attempt to recognize a so called Macedonian minority. The European Court of Human Rights had ruled that States were not obliged to recognize and or initiate procedure of recognition of a group. Having said that, a State should respect all persons claiming to represent a minority even if such did not exist. The European Court of Human Rights judgment mentioned by the Expert was related to the freedom of association, not to minority rights. In fact, the European Court of Human Rights on the case \"Home of Macedonian Civilization\" had dismissed the claim that they were victims of discrimination. Regarding conscientious objectors, Greece had not ratified the European Convention on Nationalities. Those rejecting both military and administrative services were committing a punishable offense. Multiple accusations in conscientious objectors cases did not breach the ne bis in idem principle. The article that provided a legal basis for law suits and high fines against the press would be abolished. The delegation informed that there had been a mapping of all health care establishments in prisons. Doctors would soon take up their positions, but problems and shortages of medical staff were still acute. Integration of the psychiatric care facilities in the national health care system was being looked into. With regard to the measures protecting the principle of non-refoulement, the delegation said that national trainers had been nominated to train border patrol and other actors involved directly with migrants and refugees. Other measures had also been taken, such as the translation to Greek of a manual provided by Frontex, the compilation of an epitome of fundamental best practices for border guards, and the establishment of regional focal point officers supervising fundamental rights. Follow-up Questions by ExpertsAn Expert said the questions on legal aid had not been fully answered and asked the delegation to provide the answers in written form.There had been numerous allegations of push-backs occurring recently and not in 2013. Those had to do mostly with land crossings. Civil society had highlighted lack of political will to investigate them, which amounted to a culture of impunity. Could the State party provide concrete cases in which criminal or disciplinary proceedings had been lodged? With respect to the new hot-spots envisioned as the way forward, the concern of the Committee was whether adequate accountability would be ensured on behalf of the State Party.Another Expert clarified his question with regard to the minorities and the position under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (and not the European Convention on Minorities, which did not define Minorities). Namely, the Covenant did not require an act of recognition, but it required that a minority have the right, in community, to enjoy its culture, profess its own religion, speak its own language. Religious identity was only one type of minority. The Expert did not understand the delegation's point on the \"Macedonian\" ethnicity. He was baffled that any minority that wanted to assert that identity would be denied the right to freedom of association. Replies by the DelegationThe delegation agreed that freedom of association had to be respected, but only under strict articles enumerated in the Covenant. Closing RemarksKOSTANTINOS PAPAIOANNOU, Secretary-General for Transparency and Human Rights, Ministry of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights of Greece, said that in the following months a number of measures were going to be implemented with regard to respect of human rights, namely with respect to members of the gay, lesbian, bi-sexual and trans-sexual community. The review of the Penal Code would also examine the outdated provisions such as 347, regarding unnatural indecency, and the articles on blasphemy. He expressed his gratitude for the fruitful exchange of opinions.Dheerujlall SEETULSINGH, Vice-Chairperson of the Committee, stated that the Committee was fully aware of the difficulties Greece was currently facing. The dialogue had been very frank and the delegation had conceded that there were certain problems. The Committee took note that the Ministry was one of transparency and human rights, and the delegation had lived up to those standards. The Committee expected a genuine response to the questions and not reiteration of the replies in the report. \n",

      "Human Rights CouncilAFTERNOON22 March 2017 Starts General Debate on the Annual Report of the High Commissioner and Reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-GeneralThe Human Rights Council this afternoon heard Kate Gilmore, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, presenting country reports by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and by the United Nations Secretary-General on Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Cyprus and Iran, and then started a general debate on the annual report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General. Presenting the report on Guatemala, Ms. Gilmore commended the progress in the fight against corruption and against impunity for past and present human rights violations, including through prosecution of several ex-military officers for crimes against humanity.  She urged the Congress to adopt the bills on justice reforms and the recognition of indigenous jurisdiction without undermining the essence or the coherence of the reform. In Honduras, Ms. Gilmore said the human rights situation, in particular the levels of violence and insecurity, were alarming.  Impactful, human rights-compliant security and justice responses, in particular to organized crime, were urgently needed.  The Office would work on supporting protection of those at risk of human rights violations and abuses, specifically in remote rural and indigenous communities, and on addressing the persisting high levels of gender-based violence. The Peace Agreement in Colombia was permeated with human rights, providing a unique platform to address structural deficiencies, including poverty, inequality and discrimination, the Deputy High Commissioner said.  Victims' rights must be given full effect, through reparations and accountability for past human rights and international humanitarian law violations, in order to consolidate peace. In Cyprus, Ms. Gilmore said the commitment of the parties to the resumption of peace talks raised hope that a comprehensive settlement of the question of Cyprus could be reached.  The outstanding issues related to the question of missing persons and property rights; continued discrimination; and restriction to freedom of movement, freedom of religion, cultural rights, freedom of expression, and the right to education. The rate of executions in Iran, including of juveniles, drug offenders and political prisoners, was alarming, said Ms. Gilmore.  Various forms of discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities persisted, particularly of the Baha'is who were the most severely prosecuted religious minority in Iran, and the harmful practice of child marriage remained both legal and pervasive in the country. Colombia, speaking as a concerned country, assured that the necessary changes to the institutional, legislative and judicial framework were being made, and that there would not be impunity in the country.  The cases of threats and murders of social leaders and defenders were being investigated on a case by case basis. Cyprus, speaking as a concerned country, said that the most blatant violations of human rights occurring on the island included disappearances of Greek Cypriots which did not lead to any investigation, restrictions imposed on the accessibility of religious buildings, sites or cemeteries, and non-implementation by Turkey of relevant judgements of the European Court of Human Rights. Guatemala, speaking as a concerned country, recognized that the report contained appreciation and observations that were correct, but lacked information on the activities of some important institutions.  The report did not reflect important information about the steps and measures taken to enable the work of civil society and units to analyse attacks against human rights defenders.   Honduras, speaking as a concerned country, stressed the enormous challenges it faced in the implementation of human rights, such as poverty, extreme poverty, insecurity, violence and corruption.   Honduras recognized the importance of the work of human rights defenders and stated the commitment to meet the needs of some 174,000 persons who had to flee violence by organized crime and drug trafficking groups. Iran, speaking as a concerned country, said that the report presented did not provide a thorough and appropriate image of the real situation of human rights in Iran.  Iran had constructively engaged in human rights processes at various national, regional and international levels, and had adopted the \"Charter on Citizens' Rights\" in December 2016. The Council then held its general debate on the annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General, in which speakers expressed appreciation for the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the country level, and voiced concern about violence and reprisals against human rights defenders in Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras, particularly those who defended the land, environment and indigenous peoples' rights.  The impunity for those crimes was a concern as well, and speakers noted that police had often ignored death threats and intimidation that had preceded many killings of human rights defenders.  The dire humanitarian and human rights situation in Yemen was very worrying; all parties should commit to a durable cessation of hostilities.   Speaking were Malta on behalf of the European Union, Switzerland, Germany, United Kingdom, United States, Greece, Australia, Turkey, Ireland, Norway and Spain. Also taking the floor was Bureau International des Droits Humains - Action Colombie. Speaking in right of reply were Russia and the Philippines.  The Council will resume its work at 9 a.m. on Thursday, 23 March to conclude its general debate on the annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General.  The Council will then hear the presentation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Afghanistan and an oral update on Yemen, followed by a general debate on technical assistance and capacity building.   Documentation The Council has before it an addendum to the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the activities of his office in Guatemala ( A/HRC/34/3/Add.1).\\xe3\\x80\\x80\n",

      "The Council has before it  corrigendum to an addendum to the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the activities of his office in Guatemala (A/HRC/34/3/Add.4/Corr.1). The Council has before it the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the question of human rights in Cyprus (A/HRC/34/15). The Council has before it situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran - report of the Secretary-General (A/HRC/34/40).  The Council has before it the report of the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the field of Human Rights (A/HRC/34/74).  Presentation of Country Reports by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and by the United Nations Secretary-General KATE GILMORE, Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, presented five reports of the United Nations Secretary-General and the High Commissioner for Human Rights on Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, Cyprus and Iran.   Starting with the report on Guatemala, the Deputy High Commissioner expressed deep sorrow at the death in a fire of at least 40 girls trapped in a government-run shelter on International Women's Day.  They had been locked inside and unable to escape; that tragedy had to be investigated and those responsible brought to justice.  Ms. Gilmore commended the progress in the fight against corruption and impunity for past and present human rights violations, including through the prosecution of several ex-military officers for crimes against humanity.  However, the stalling debates on reforms in the area of justice reforms, and the rejection of recognition of indigenous jurisdiction, were disappointing.  The Congress should move ahead with the adoption of the bill without undermining the essence or the coherence of the reform, and steps ought to be taken to safeguard the rights of indigenous peoples and to ensure their full and genuine participation in decision-making, especially in the context of hydroelectric, mining and other projects.    In Honduras, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights had proudly opened a country office at the end of 2016.  Ms. Gilmore said the human rights situation in the country was a cause for grave concerns, and the levels of violence and insecurity remained alarming.  Impactful, human rights compliant security and justice responses - in particular to organized crime - were urgently needed.  The Office had cautioned the authorities against expanding the use of the armed forces to encompass a civilian security task and had also counselled against the overly broad definition of terrorism contained in the recently adopted law.  One of the top priorities in Honduras was supporting the protection of those at risk of human rights violations and abuses, specifically in remote rural and indigenous communities.  While the efforts to implement the law for the protection of human rights defenders were encouraging, true progress required a wholehearted pursuit of accountability for attacks on human rights defenders.  Further, the Office was working with human rights defenders to address the persisting high levels of gender-based violence and the legislation and practices that discriminated against women, including criminalization of abortion. Ms. Gilmore further noted that the Peace Agreement in Colombia was permeated with human rights, providing a unique platform to address structural deficiencies, including poverty, inequality and discrimination.  The Office was honoured to have been entrusted with supporting the implementation of that Agreement, as concerned security guarantees and reintegration mechanisms.  It was essential for the victims' rights to be given full effect, through reparations and accountability for past human rights and international humanitarian law violations, in order to consolidate peace.  The challenges were numerous - the recent increase of violence in rural areas, violence including killings against human rights defenders, and the persistent corruption and inequality in the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. The report on Cyprus noted progress in the search for and the identification of missing persons, increased interreligious communication and cooperation, and cooperation for preservation of religious sites, said the Deputy High Commissioner.  Those developments occurred in the context of the commitment of the parties to the resumption of peace talks, which raised hopes that a comprehensive settlement of the question of Cyprus could be reached.  The persistent division of Cyprus continued to hinder the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, with outstanding issues related to the question of missing persons and property rights, as well as continued discrimination, restriction to freedom of movement, freedom of religion, cultural rights, freedom of expression and the right to education. Ms. Gilmore said that in his report on Iran, the United Nations Secretary-General expressed concerns about the alarming rate of executions, including of juveniles, drug offenders and political prisoners, the continued practice of public and mass executions, and the sentencing of individuals to stoning.  2016 had been marked by pervasive restrictions on freedom of opinion and expression, including a crackdown on journalists, artists and anti-death penalty and women rights activists.  Various forms of discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities persisted, particularly of the Baha'is, who were the most severely prosecuted religious minority in Iran.  The authorities failed to take steps to repeal discrimination against women and girls in law and in practice, while the harmful practice of child marriage remained both legal and pervasive in the country. Statements by Concerned Countries Colombia, speaking as a concerned country, said that it considered the peace agreement between the Government and FARC-EP as an opportunity to work together to guarantee the respect of human rights and a stable and lasting peace.  Colombia assured that necessary changes to the institutional, legislative and judicial framework were being made, and there would not be impunity in the country.  It reiterated its commitment to the victims, and said that the cases of threats and murders of social leaders and were being investigated on a case by case basis.  Colombia said that it hoped to continue to have the support of the international community, for which it was grateful.  It hoped to improve the coordination between stakeholders, build synergies and do all it could to promote equality in the country. Cyprus, speaking as a concerned country, recognised the value and the necessity of the report of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which highlighted the most blatant violations of human rights occurring on the island.  Those included disappearances of Greek Cypriots, which had not led to any investigation, restrictions imposed on the accessibility of religious buildings, sites or cemeteries, and non-implementation by Turkey of relevant judgements of the European Court of Human Rights.  The report also noted the massive destruction of cultural heritage sites and artefacts in the northern part of Cyprus.  Cyprus confirmed its commitment to the negotiation process, and called on Turkey to transform its rhetoric so that the negotiations could be successful.  It also urged Turkey to end its military occupation. Guatemala, speaking as a concerned country, explained that the Government was working to respond to the protection needs of children in shelters and to ensure accidents would not take place again.  It recognized that the report included appreciation and observations that were correct, as well as acceptable recommendations.  However, there was also a lack information on the activities of some important institutions.  Guatemala was committed to implementing all human rights enshrined in the Constitution, including on the freedom of assembly, association and peaceful protest, and the rights of human rights defenders.  The report did not reflect important information about the steps and measures that the Government had taken to enable the work of civil society and units to analyse attacks against human rights defenders.  The Government was ready to cooperate and provide any additional information to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Honduras, speaking as a concerned country, reminded that the Government faced enormous challenges in the implementation of human rights; the challenges included poverty, extreme poverty, insecurity, violence and corruption.   At the moment, Honduras was devoting most of its efforts to combat poverty, especially extreme poverty in rural areas.  The most vulnerable groups were those prioritized in that respect, namely women, children, youth, indigenous peoples, persons of African descent, persons with disabilities, elderly persons, migrants and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.  Guatemala recognized the importance of the work of human rights defenders.  As for organized crime and drug trafficking, some 174,000 persons had had to leave their homes due to violence in the country.  The Government was ready to meet their needs and to find lasting solutions.  Since 2011, the State had managed to reduce the murder rate by 30 per cent.   Iran, speaking as a concerned country, said that it was unfortunate that appropriate attention had not been paid to the information provided by Iran to the United Nations human rights mechanisms.  The report presented did not provide a thorough and appropriate image of the real situation of human rights in Iran.  The Government attached great importance to the promotion and protection of human rights, and the facts showed that Iran had made achievements in areas such as constructively engaging in human rights processes at various national, regional and international levels.  In December 2016, President Rohani had introduced the \"Charter on Citizens' Rights\" and ordered all departments of the executive branch to implement it.  Iran had also reported to relevant treaty bodies in accordance with international obligations.  Several mandate-holders among the Special Procedures had been invited to Iran, including the Special Rapporteur on the right to food.  The continuation of the Special Rapporteur's mandate with regard to Iran was unconstructive and unnecessary.  General Debate on the annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General Malta, speaking on behalf of the European Union, valued the work of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at the country level.  The European Union voiced concern about the situation of human rights defenders in Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras, particularly those who defended the land, environment and indigenous peoples' rights.  It drew attention to the human rights situation in the occupied Palestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan.  The European Union reiterated its strong opposition to Israel's illegal settlement policy, and called for the lifting of the Gaza blockade.   Switzerland remained concerned about reprisals against human rights defenders in Honduras and the fact that no adequate investigations had been carried out.  It was also concerned about the new law curbing the right to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in Honduras, and about the attacks against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons in Guatemala.  As for Colombia, Switzerland was concerned about the threats against civil society.  Germany commended the peace agreement reached between the Government of Colombia and the FARC.  Colombia, Guatemala and Honduras faced the challenge of the fight against impunity, as well as the deteriorating situation of human rights defenders.  That was particularly true for those who defended the environment, land and indigenous rights.  It was of concern that police had often ignored death threats and intimidation that had preceded many killings of human rights defenders. United Kingdom welcomed the historic peace agreement in Colombia and urged all those supporting the agreement to ensure that human rights remained a guiding principle.  In Guatemala, the continued high level of violence against women and girls was of concern.  The safety of human rights defenders in Honduras, particularly those defending the rights of indigenous peoples and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, was a source of great concern, and the United Kingdom welcomed the adoption of the law on their protection. United States was concerned about the dire humanitarian and human rights situation in Yemen and called on all parties to commit to a durable cessation of hostilities.  In Bahrain, the steps taken since 2016 raised serious concerns about respect for freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association.  The commitment of Turkey to ensure transparency in bringing to justice those responsible for the coup was welcomed.  Turkey should investigate any allegation of detainee mistreatment, and continue to grant access to independent monitors. Greece said that the reports needed to comprehensively address the human rights situation of about 500 Greek-Cypriots enclaved in the occupied part of the island, as well as address the root cause of internal displacement, which was the persistent denial, based on ethnic grounds, to more than 200,000 Greek-Cypriots, of their right to property and residence in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Australia expressed concern about ongoing reports of extrajudicial killings in the Philippines and called on the Government of the Philippines to ensure due process and accountability.  The Philippines was further called on not to reinstate the death penalty.  The Government of Venezuela was urged to address human rights concerns and allow visits by the relevant Special Rapporteurs.  Australia commended Tunisia for its efforts to place human rights at the centre of its transition to democracy.   Turkey spoke about the continued isolation of Turkish Cypriots and said the lack of preventive measures was not accurately reflected.  There was not a single Turkish language school and Greek Cypriots refused to allow crossing which was a discriminatory policy.  Turkey continued to support a comprehensive solution in Cyprus.  Ireland congratulated Colombia on the peace agreement and noted that while the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights had undertaken additional responsibility under the peace agreement, the resources available to it had not increased.  All three complementary aspects of United Nations action, namely peace, development and human rights would be crucial in achieving sustainable peace in Colombia, and Ireland would continue to support the Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights in carrying out its work.  Norway welcomed the final peace agreement between the Government of Colombia and FARC-EP and commended the country's efforts.  Norway expressed its concerns about the increase in violence against human rights defenders and community leaders and urged Colombia to prevent and investigate those acts of violence.  Norway also expressed its concern about the situation of human rights defenders in Honduras and the overall high murder rate in the country, and urged it to recognise the role of human rights defenders in promoting democracy and the rule of law. Spain congratulated Columbia for the historic peace agreement it had signed with FARC-EP, considering it the beginning of a new era of hope for the country.  Spain hoped Colombia would carry out all the necessary effort to fully implement the agreements in terms of reparations for the victims, the rights of the indigenous peoples and ensuring security for human rights defenders.  Spain recognized the efforts of the Government of Honduras towards human rights defenders, and urged the Government to implement legislation and effective protection for them.  Bureau International des Droits Humains - Action Colombie, in a joint statement, stated that human rights monitoring was an important component of the peace agreement in Colombia.  However, the situation of human rights defenders had worsened, with increasing attacks on them.  The main persons responsible were military groups which had taken over areas abandoned by the FARC.  Without human rights there would be no lasting peace in the country. Right of Reply Russian Federation, speaking in a right of reply, responded to the unfounded statements made by Ukraine, the European Union and Turkey about Crimea, which was part of the Russian Federation.  The citizens of the peninsula had chosen to become part of the Russian Federation.  Thus it was incorrect to discuss the human rights situation in the Russian Federation during a consideration of human rights in Ukraine. Philippines, speaking in a right of reply, responded to statements made by Australia and the United States.  The Philippines clarified that the campaign against the drug trade was conducted in line with the rule of law and due process.  The campaign had the overwhelming support of the citizens of the Philippines.  The Government opposed extrajudicial killings and it was baseless to claim that the campaign against drugs used extrajudicial killings.  As for the death penalty, it was noted that such punishment was allowed by international human rights standards for the most serious crimes.    __________For use of the information media;

      "         (1) IraqWe have reports that in the early hours of yesterday morning, around 1h00, ISIL brought dozens of long trucks and mini-buses to Hamam al-Alil City, south of Mosul, in an attempt to forcibly transfer some 25,000 civilians towards locations in and around Mosul. We understand that most of the trucks were prevented from proceeding towards Mosul due to coalition flights patrolling the area, and the trucks were forced to return to Hamam Al-Alil. However some buses did reach Abusaif, 15 kilometres north of Hamam Al-Alil City. We have grave concerns for the safety of these and the tens of thousands of other civilians who have reportedly been forcibly relocated by ISIL in the past two weeks.Using civilians as human shields is a war crime. Under article 8(2)(c) of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, taking of hostages in a non-international armed conflict is a war crime, and under Article 8(2)(e)(viii), ordering the displacement of civilians for reasons not connected with their security or imperative military reasons is also a war crime. We urge parties to the conflict to ensure that international law is strictly observed, in particular the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution in attack. All feasible precautions must be taken to avoid and minimise the loss of civilian life and injury to civilians.We also have further reports of mass killings by ISIL. On Saturday, 40 former Iraqi Security Force soldiers were killed and their bodies thrown in the Tigris River. They were reportedly among the civilians who had been abducted earlier from al-Shura sub-district of Mosul and from villages surrounding Hamam al-Alil. There are also reports that ISIL has been threatening relatives of people they suspect are supporting the Iraqi Security Forces.\n",
      "         (2) SyriaOver the course of the weekend, there were reports of intensified shelling by armed opposition groups of civilian-populated areas in Government-controlled western Aleppo. The areas hit by mortars, rockets and other improvised explosive devices (IEDS) included the neighbourhoods of Salah al-Din, al-Shahbaa, al-Zahraa and al-Hamadaniya.More than 30 civilians, including at least 10 children, were reportedly killed and dozens of others injured as a result of the attacks on 29 and 30 October on western Aleppo. We have also received unconfirmed reports of families fleeing the hostilities towards opposition-held areas of the city. \n",
      "         \n",
      "         Such high numbers of civilian casualties suggest that armed opposition groups are failing to adhere to the fundamental prohibition under international humanitarian law on the launching of indiscriminate attacks, and the principles of precaution and proportionality. The reported use of ground-based missiles along with the use of armoured vehicles loaded with explosives used in an area containing more than one million civilian inhabitants is completely unacceptable and may constitute war crimes.Shelling of opposition-held eastern Aleppo by Government forces and their allies is also reported to be continuing. Among the neighbourhoods particularly affected are al-Ferdous, Sayf al-Dawla, al-Qaterji and al-Mashhad. At least 12 civilians including two children were reportedly killed as a result of the attacks over Saturday and Sunday. Dozens of civilians were also injured. \n",
      "         \n",
      "         While Russian Ministry of Defence representatives are reported to have stated that Syrian and Russian air forces are observing a moratorium on flights closer than 10 kilometres around Aleppo since the launch of the unilateral ceasefire on 18 October, we did receive some reports of airstrikes hitting opposition-controlled eastern Aleppo on 22 and 23 October. While there have not been airstrikes since that time, we remain concerned about 250,000 civilians at risk in this area should they resume.All parties in Aleppo are conducting hostilities which are resulting in large numbers of civilian casualties, and creating an atmosphere of terror for those who continue to live in the city. Strikes against hospitals, schools, marketplaces, water facilities and bakeries are now commonplace, and may amount to war crimes. \n",
      "         (3) Saudi Arabia / YemenWe condemn the firing of a ballistic missile deep into Saudi Arabia by the Houthis and their allies last week. The launching of any weapon indiscriminately into an area filled with civilians is forbidden under international humanitarian law. We urge all parties to the conflict to exercise restraint and to ensure full respect for international human rights and international humanitarian law.ENDS\n",

      "NEW YORK/GENEVA (22 February 2016)  - As the conflict in Syria is poised to enter its sixth year, civilians bear the brunt of intensifying hostilities conducted by an ever-increasing number of warring parties. As their country is reduced to ruins around them, Syrian men, women and children - often the objects of deliberate attack - are fleeing their homes in an uncertain and often perilous search for safe haven. \n",
      "In its latest report, the Commission of Inquiry on Syria details the catastrophic destruction of civilian infrastructure caused by five years of war, including medical care and educational facilities, public spaces, electricity and water installations. Cultural heritage sites of importance not only to Syria, but also to the world, are being destroyed and damaged through deliberate and incidental attacks. The report further explores the rending of Syria's social fabric. Under attack, under siege, and increasingly divided, trust between communities has been eroded. \n",
      "\"We are seeing an overwhelming yet consistent intensification of external military involvement in Syria by all parties, with devastating consequences for civilians and various communities. With the intensification of airstrikes, there are few safe places for civilians. They are exposed more than ever to violence,\" said Commission Chair Paulo Sergio Pinheiro. \"Relevant Security Council resolutions remain largely unheeded and unimplemented.\"\n",
      "Aerial bombardments by pro-Government forces of areas not controlled by the Government have caused hundreds of civilian casualties, mass displacements, and destruction of vital civilian infrastructure. All warring parties - pro-Government forces, anti-Government armed groups, and the terrorist groups ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra - carry out indiscriminate attacks by firing shells onto civilian-inhabited areas under control of the opposition. ISIS continues to kill, maim, and spread terror amongst the civilian population, with its use of suicide bombs and improved explosive devices. Attacks on schools and hospitals have killed healthcare staff and teachers, as well as patients and students. Through these attacks, the warring parties effectively deny the civilian population medical care and education.\n",
      "The report, the Commission's eleventh to the Human Rights Council, draws on 415 interviews with victims and eyewitnesses in and outside the country, collected between July 2015 and January 2016. It finds that crimes against humanity continue to be committed by Government forces and by the terrorist group ISIS. The commission of war crimes by belligerents is rampant.  \n",
      "\"The damage wrought on Syria by this war cannot be measured solely by loss of life and the physical destruction of the country,\" said Commissioner Vitit Muntarbhorn. \"The war has also devastated the nation of Syria, ripping asunder the ties that bind its communities and cultures together.\"\n",
      "Civilians have been deliberately targeted for attacks - including ground and air assaults, as well as sieges - where belligerents conflated a community' ethnic and/or religious background and its perceived political loyalties. In some cases, there has been intentional targeting of communities, notably by ISIS. In some cases, external intervention has exacerbated ethno-sectarian tensions.\n",
      "In areas controlled by ISIS, Syrian women and girls continue to live under unbearable restrictions, their access to education, work and freedom of movement severely curtailed or completely denied. Thousands of Yazidi women and girls who were captured in Iraq in August 2014 and brought to Syria continue to be held in sexual slavery, bought and sold like chattel. ISIS continues to forcibly recruit captured Yazidi boys, some as young as seven. \n",
      "Belligerents in Rif Damascus, Idlib, and Dayr az-Zawr governorates continue employing sieges, while the primary victims of this brutal tactic remain the nearly 400,000 vulnerable civilians trapped inside densely populated districts where food, water, medicine and electricity are scarce. Owing to the escalation in hostilities countrywide, an additional 4.5 million Syrian men, women, and children are confined to areas where humanitarian actors do not have regular access.\n",
      "The report emphasises the need for concerted and sustained international action to find a political solution to end the violence and to stop the rampancy of war crimes and grave violations of human rights.\n",
      "\"Humanitarian space is shrinking daily, while flagrant violations of human rights and international humanitarian law continue with blatant impunity,\" said Commissioner Carla Del Ponte. \"The call for peace is now more urgent than ever, but momentum must be sustained to ensure an all-inclusive, Syrian-led process. Accountability is an essential part of this process.\"                                                      Ms. Del Ponte stressed that Resolution 2139 underlined the need to end impunity and reaffirmed the necessity of bringing perpetrators to justice. BackgroundThe Commission, which comprises Mr. Paulo Sergio Pinheiro (Chair), Ms. Karen Koning AbuZayd, Ms. Carla Del Ponte, and Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn, has been mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate and record all violations of international law March 2011 in the Syrian Arab Republic. \n",

      "We commend the invaluable work of the Interdisciplinary Group of Independent Experts (IGIE) in Mexico on the case of the enforced disappearance in Iguala of 43 students from the Ayotzinapa teacher-training college in Guerrero State, and the killing of six others in 2014. The Group, which was appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and invited by the Mexican Government to follow up on the investigation of the case, published its extensive 605-page report on Sunday.\n",
      "The Iguala case received huge attention, not just in Mexico itself but all across the world, and became a test case of the authorities' willingness and ability to tackle violent crime and corruption. As High Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein stressed during his mission to Mexico last October, it is very important that the Government acts decisively on the IGIE's recommendations and ensures the rights to truth and justice of the victims and their families*. We welcome the willingness expressed by the President of Mexico and the Attorney-General's Office to take into serious consideration the Group's recommendations and we urge them to fully explore the new lines of inquiry suggested by the Group, and to strengthen the investigations into this emblematic case.\n",
      "We are however concerned about the many challenges and obstacles reported by the experts that may have prevented certain lines of inquiries from being further explored, including regarding the roles and responsibilities of the military and other official authorities. We call on the Government to ensure effective follow-up to the investigation report and to tackle the broader structural challenges it has exposed. We also encourage the Government to engage with the follow-up mechanism that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights has announced that it will establish. The Iguala case shows the crucial role that international cooperation can play in helping States to fight impunity for serious human rights violations. \n",

      "We should like to stress that under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Mauritania became a State party in 2004, the death penalty, if not abolished, can only be applied for the most serious crimes.\n",

      "Human Rights Council12  March 2020The Human  Rights Council in its midday meeting adopted the Universal Periodic Review  outcomes of Fiji, San Marino, Iran, Angola and Kazakhstan.  Nazhat Shameem  Khan, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at Geneva,  said that human rights were a catalyst for transformative change and the  Universal Periodic Review mechanism was a vehicle through which such change  took place.  The important recommendations Fiji had received would  progressively transform the country and help the advancement of its human  rights journey.  Delegations commended  Fiji's strong commitment to combatting the negative effects of climate change,  including its robust legislative framework, disaster preparedness efforts and  measures to strengthen resilience.  Fiji had strengthened judicial  independence and improved the situation of human rights defenders ; however,  the limitations to the right to assembly and freedom of expression continued  and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and defenders  faced threats and harassment.Speaking were Vanuatu,  Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Barbados, Botswana, China, Cuba, Egypt, Guyana,  Haiti, Iran and Libya, as well as the representatives of the following  non-governmental organizations : International Parenthood Federation,  International Service for Human Rights, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative  and Civicus - World Alliance for Citizen Participation.The President  of the Council informed that out of 242 recommendations received, 207 enjoyed  the support of Fiji and 35 had been noted.  The Council adopted the  outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Fiji.  The delegation  of San Marino was unable to travel to Geneva due to COVID-19 pandemic.  In  the statement read by Maria Del Socorro Flores Liera, Vice-President of the  Human Rights Council, San Marino said that it would discuss the best way to set  up a national human rights institution.  Because the country had not yet  had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.Cyprus, Iraq,  Libya, Venezuela, Burkina Faso and China, as well as the Centre for Global  Non-Killing spoke in the discussion.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations, 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted ; additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Esmaeil  Baghaei Hamaneh, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations Office  at Geneva, said that Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic to  protect its citizens and the whole humanity.  But, its health capacity was  viciously targeted by the United States' unilateral sanctions and this was  something the Council could not afford to ignore.High Council  for Human Rights of Iran said that the amendment of the law on the punishment  of drug traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.   Torture and ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic  teaching and steps had been taken to strengthen the independence of judges,  access to lawyers and fair trial.Iran's efforts  to provide for refugees despite the challenges it faced and the measures to  empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce infant mortality were  acknowledged.  Several speakers noted that unilateral sanctions were  harmful to the promotion of human rights, especially given the ongoing need to  combat COVID-19 ; others recognized the difficulties in this fight and pledged  their assistance to Iran.  The human rights situation in the country,  including the crackdown on protests in November 2019, remained of  concern.  Speaking in  the discussion were Russia, China, Sri Lanka, Syria, United Kingdom, Venezuela,  Afghanistan, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana and the Philippines.  Also taking  the floor were the following non-governmental organizations : Society of  Iranian Women Advocating Sustainable Development of Environment, Disability  Association of Tavana, Baha'i International Community, Lawyers for Lawyers,  World Jewish Congress, Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, Human  Rights Watch, Rahbord Peimayesh Research and Educational Services Cooperative  and Centre for Inquiry.  The President  of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations received, Iran  supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations ; the Council then adopted the  outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.Margarida Rosa  da Silva Izata, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations Office  at Geneva, said that the accepted recommendations corresponded to the national  priorities anchored in the 2018-2022 Development Plan, aimed at strengthening  legal institutions, improving the sustainable development index and protecting  human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The national strategy on human  rights had been approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2020.  In the  discussions that followed, the delegations welcomed new measures on access to  justice and the adoption of new criminal code and were pleased by the major  progress in poverty elimination, decreasing children mortality rate and the  improvement of the human development index.  Concerns remained about the  excessive use of force against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders,  while food insecurity in the south of the country, according to some speakers,  warranted a declaration of a state of emergency.Sudan, China,  Afghanistan, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Venezuela and  the Democratic Republic of the Congo took part in the discussion.  Also  speaking were the United Nations Population Fund, as well as International  Volunteerism Organization for Women, Education and Development, Lutheran World  Federation, International Service for Human Rights, Ingenieurs du Monde,  CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation and Rencontre Africaine  pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme.The President  of the Council said that out of 270 recommendations received, 259 enjoyed the  support of Angola and 11 had been noted.  The Council adopted the outcome  of the Universal Periodic Review of Angola.Zhanar Aitzhanova,  Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations Office at Geneva,  said that her country's priorities included protecting and promoting the rights  of people, developing an inclusive economy and addressing social  problems.  Kazakhstan had recently decided to abolish the death penalty  and had toughened the penalties for the crime of human trafficking.  The  law on peaceful assembly was being revised and Parliament was considering  legislation to ensure political parties included 30 per cent women and  youth.  Kazakhstan had  made progress in eliminating discrimination against women but should  criminalize all forms of violence against women and girls, delegations said in  the discussion.  They welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and the  establishment of an inter-agency commission to combat trafficking in  persons.  Noting reports of harassment of lawyers, several speakers called  on Kazakhstan to take immediate measures to ensure their full independence.Speaking were  Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Russia, Burundi, China, Cuba, Egypt  and Iran.  UN Women, United Nations Children's Fund and United Nations  Population Fund also spoke, as did the representatives of the International Bar  Association, Action Canada for Population and Development, Article 19 - The  International Centre Against Censorship, Asian Forum for Human Rights and  Development (joint statement), International Lesbian and Gay Association and  the Alliance Defending Freedom.The President  of the Council informed that out of 245 recommendations received, 214 enjoyed  the support of Kazakhstan and 31 had been noted.  The Council then adopted  the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan.Summaries of  the Committee's public meetings in English and French are available at the  United Nations Office at Geneva News and Media page, while the webcast can be viewed at UN Web TV.The Council is  holding a full day of meetings today.  It will resume its work at 3 p.m.  to continue its consideration of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review  of Madagascar, Iraq, Slovenia, Egypt, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of FijiNAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, said Fiji had received 242 recommendations, of which it had  accepted 187 following the review.  Having considered the remaining 55  recommendations, Fiji had accepted 20 and noted the rest of the  recommendations.  Fiji placed great importance on the Universal Periodic  Review process and appreciated the immense value of a constructive peer-review  that was informed by the experiences of other States.  Fiji was pleased to  see that the number of States participating in its Universal Periodic Review  had doubled since the second cycle.Human rights  were a catalyst for transformative change and Fiji recognized that the  Universal Periodic Review mechanism and process was a vehicle through which  such change took place.  Following its second Review, Fiji had abolished  the death penalty and ratified all core human rights instruments.  It had  become a State party to the United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime and its three protocols.  The important recommendations  Fiji had received would progressively transform the country and help the  advancement of its human rights journey.  Like other States, Fiji did not  pretend to have all the answers to its challenges, but it recognized the  importance of this peer review process to achieve progress and further  substantive equality and justice.Several  delegations commended the country's strong commitment to combatting the  negative effects of climate change, including its robust legislative framework,  disaster preparedness efforts and measures to strengthen resilience.  Fiji  had strengthened the independence of the judiciary via the 2013 Constitution,  speakers noted and went on to highlight the progress in addressing the  challenges faced by women and girls and victims of trafficking in persons and  the strengthening of the rights of vulnerable groups, children and persons with  disabilities in particular.  They urged Fiji to use the International  Technical Guidelines for Sexual Education in revising the family life education  curriculum.   Fiji had  engaged in open and constructive dialogue with civil society throughout the  review process, they said.  The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders was  being implemented and conditions of human rights defenders had improved.   However, the right to assembly and freedom of expression continued to be  limited, which was why Fiji should repeal the Public Order Amendment Act and  the Media and Industry Development Act.  Since lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender and intersex persons and defenders continued to face threats and harassment,  Fiji should incorporate discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and  gender identity in its anti-discrimination laws.The President  of the Council informed that out of 242 recommendations received, 207 enjoyed  the support of Fiji and 35 had been noted.  NAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, thanked the countries that participated in the Universal Periodic  Review and noted that this process was an important part of the prevention  agenda of the Human Rights Council.  Fiji was encouraged by the number of  recommendations that integrated climate policy with human rights, which  indicated a growing acceptance that national climate policies must take into  account the rights of all persons, especially those disproportionately affected  by climate change.  Ms. Khan acknowledged that her country had to work  hard to integrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex issues into its  national human rights policies.The Council then  adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Fiji.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of San MarinoThe delegation  of San Marino was unable to travel to Geneva due to COVID-19 pandemic.  In  its statement read out by MARIA DEL SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of  the Human Rights Council, San Marino said that during its Universal  Periodic Review, it had received and carefully examined 109  recommendations.  By fully accepting 72 and partially accepting 1  recommendation, San Marino had agreed to ratify the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization conventions and the Agreement on the  Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.  Special  attention was provided to the recommendation to establish a national human  rights institution ; a discussion on the best way to set it up would take place  in the coming years.San Marino had  not accepted recommendations concerning the tightening of anti-discrimination  law and it had noted recommendations related to decriminalization of abortion  and women's participation in political life.  Because the country had not  yet had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.  Finally, recommendation number 101 had  been partially accepted, since setting up a special section for minors was  unnecessary as those tasks were already being carried out by specialized  judges.  A counselling centre for separated parents with children would be  seriously considered, however.In the ensuing  discussion, speakers said they understood the capacity issues faced by San  Marino and hoped that it would nonetheless consider ratifying the International  Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  soon.  The dialogue during the Review had been frank and open and  testified to San Marino's will to implement recommendations.  Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted.  Additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.MARIA DEL  SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of the Human Rights Council,  reading out the statement on behalf of San Marino, thanked all those who spoke  during the debate and noted that San Marino was committed to carefully  considering all the suggestions made.  The recent visit of the head of  State to the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review session had  shown San Marino's commitment to the process.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of IranESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that human rights were a common good that  contributed to human solidarity, without which it would be impossible to  nurture empathy to shield human rights from infringements and  transgressions.  The current international climate was obsessively hostile  to nurturing genuine human solidarity to protect and promote that common  good.  Human rights were the main casualty of today's international  relations.For instance,  while Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic and to protect  its citizens and the whole humanity, its health capacity was viciously targeted  by the United States' unilateral sanctions.  This was something the  Council could not afford to ignore, as it affected the basic rights of the  population.  For years, developing countries were scapegoated for human  rights violations, which were abusively invoked as a tool to stigmatize targeted  nations.  Against this backdrop, the Universal Periodic Review mechanism  was exceptionally important and Iran was one of its main supporters.High Council for Human Rights of Iran said that Iran had received 329 recommendations during its third  Universal Periodic Review cycle, 188 of which had been accepted in whole or  partially.  It did not accept 123 recommendations and had noted 18 which  were in contradiction with the Constitution, Islamic values or cultural  principles.  The abbreviation of life was only considered for the most  serious crimes and the amendment of the law on the punishment of drug  traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.  The  bill on the protection of children and adolescents adopted in 2018 was an  important step forward, while child offenders could be held in a correction  centre for a maximum of five years.  Torture and  ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic teaching, as  well as under Iran's criminal laws and international obligations.  Iran  had taken steps to strengthen the independence of judges, access to lawyer,  fair trial, forbidding arbitrary detention and torture.  Having mostly  accepted the recommendations related to women's rights, Iran had adopted policy  and legislation related to the promotion of women and family life, transfer of  nationality and protection of women from violence.  In the  discussion, the delegations appreciated Iran's cooperation with human rights  mechanisms and the acceptance of the majority of recommendations received.   Iran's efforts to provide for refugees despite challenges it faced and the  efforts to empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce the mortality  rate for children at birth were acknowledged.  Speakers recognized the  difficulties involved in fighting COVID-19 virus and pledged assistance to Iran  in this domain.Several  speakers warned against the political use of the human rights issue and  reiterated that unilateral sanctions were harmful to the promotion of human rights,  especially given the ongoing need to combat COVID-19.  Others remained  deeply concerned at the human rights situation and the repeated refusal by Iran  to allow access to United Nations Special Rapporteurs.  They condemned the  crackdown on protests in November 2019 and remained worried at the ongoing  detention of dual nationals who, given the risks to their health by COVID-19  virus, should be released.The President of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations  received, Iran supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations.ESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said Iran had examined all recommendations with an open  mind and a spirit of cooperation.  Certain recommendations could not be  noted as they amounted to repeated allegations and biased propositions.   Unilateral sanctions pressuring the Iranian people had not distracted the  Government from efforts to safeguard human rights, the right to health,  education and development, as well as children's and women's rights.  The  sanctions by the United States targeted the basic human rights of the entire  Iranian population.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of AngolaMARGARIDA ROSA  DA SILVA IZATA, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that during its last Universal Periodic Review cycle  Angola had received 270 recommendations from 110 States.  Of those, it had  accepted 259 and had taken due note of the remaining 11.  The accepted  recommendations corresponded to the national priorities and programmes anchored  in the 2018-2022 Development Plan, aimed at strengthening legal institutions,  improving the sustainable development index and protecting rights human rights  and fundamental freedoms.  The national strategy on human rights, already  approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2020, would serve as the  political framework for capacity-building to promote and protect human rights  and to address the violations.  The situation of human rights would  periodically be assessed by the National Security Council.  As for the 11  recommendations that Angola had taken note of, the creation of a national human  rights institution in line with the Paris Principles was envisaged.  The  Ombudsman, an independent public institution that defended the rights and  fundamental freedoms of individuals, was in line with the Paris Principles and  it effectively functioned as a national human rights institution.  Angola  was ready to extend an invitation to human rights special procedures.Angola was a  party to the United Nations and African Union conventions against corruption  and was a founding member of the Kimberley Process.  A working group had  been created to assess the compatibility of the Extractive Industry  Transparency Initiative with the domestic legal system.In the  discussion that followed, the delegations welcomed new measures on access to  justice, the adoption of new criminal code and the ratification of a large  number of human rights instruments.  They were also pleased by the  establishment of the national human rights institution and the adoption of the  national human rights strategy, the major progress in poverty elimination,  decreasing children mortality rate and the improvement of the human development  index.  Angola had also improved the presence of women in public life and  taken actions to combat violence against women and girls, notably via the recent  criminalization of female genital mutilation.Concerns,  however, remained with regards to the excessive use of force against peaceful  protesters and human rights defenders ; lack of access to water in urban and  rural areas ; and the food insecurity in the south of the country, which,  according to some speakers, warranted a declaration of a state of  emergency.  Discrimination against persons with disabilities, including  persons with albinism, remained and families with children with disabilities  needed more support.  Angola should furthermore amend article 24 of Family  Code to abolish any exceptions to the prohibition of child marriage.The President  of the Council informed that out of 270 recommendations received, 259 enjoyed  the support of Angola and 11 had been noted.  MARGARIDA ROSA  DA SILVA IZATA, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, thanked the Council for their work and promised to  continue the crusade for the defence of all human rights at regional, national  and the international level.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of  Angola.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of KazakhstanZHANAR  AITZHANOVA, Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that, following the recent elections, a National  Council for Public Trust had been established consisting of representatives of  civil society, to ensure the State was responsive to the needs of  citizens.  Kazakhstan's priorities included protecting and promoting the  rights of people, developing an inclusive economy and addressing social  problems.  The Government  had examined 245 recommendations as part of the review, accepting 214 and  noting 31.  Kazakhstan had recently decided to abolish the death penalty  and had toughened the penalties for the crime of human trafficking, while the  revision of the law on peaceful assembly was ongoing.  As several  recommendations had been made to enhance political participation of women and  youth in the decision-making process, Parliament was considering legislation to  ensure political parties included 30 per cent women and youth.  The Law on  Trade Unions had been amended to better align it with the International Labour  Organization Convention 87.  Unnecessary reporting requirements for  non-governmental organizations were being eliminated and registration  procedures simplified.  Kazakhstan was  committed to the 2030 Agenda and had integrated Sustainable Development Goals  in 80 per cent of the strategic government programs.  As it had received  17 recommendations related to eliminating discrimination based on sexual  orientation and gender identity, it was currently considering a draft law on Family  and Gender Policy.   Furthermore, Kazakhstan was taking steps to  address the rights of migrants, refugees and stateless people.The  delegations welcomed the legislative amendments aimed at improving access to  birth registration procedures to ensure the registration of every child.   Kazakhstan had made progress in eliminating discrimination against women but  should criminalize all forms of violence against women and girls.  Several  speakers welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty, efforts to ensure equal  access to health care services, efforts to help citizens find work and the  establishment of an inter-agency commission to combat trafficking in  persons.  While  Kazakhstan had decided to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment of children,  it had not accepted the recommendations to strengthen the protection of migrant  children.  Some speakers noted reports of harassment of lawyers by members  of the judiciary and law enforcement, calling on Kazakhstan take immediate  measures to ensure full independence of lawyers.  Commending the ongoing  judicial reform, they called on Kazakhstan to ratify the optional protocols to  the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on  the Rights of the Child.  The President  of the Council informed that out of 245 recommendations received, 214 enjoyed  the support of Kazakhstan and 31 had been noted.  ZHANAR  AITZHANOVA, Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, thanked the Council and reiterated the importance of the  Universal Periodic Review process.  Kazakhstan would dedicate all the  necessary resources to implement the recommendations and remained committed to  continuing an open dialogue with the United Nations for the promotion of peace  and the protection of fundamental human rights.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan.___________For use of the

Shameem  Khan, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at Geneva,  said that human rights were a catalyst for transformative change and the  Universal Periodic Review mechanism was a vehicle through which such change  took place.  The important recommendations Fiji had received would  progressively transform the country and help the advancement of its human  rights journey.  Delegations commended  Fiji's strong commitment to combatting the negative effects of climate change,  including its robust legislative framework, disaster preparedness efforts and  measures to strengthen resilience.  Fiji had strengthened judicial  independence and improved the situation of human rights defenders ; however,  the limitations to the right to assembly and freedom of expression continued  and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and defenders  faced threats and harassment.Speaking were Vanuatu,  Solomon Islands, Afghanistan, Barbados, Botswana, China, Cuba, Egypt, Guyana,  Haiti, Iran and Libya, as well as the representatives of the following  non-governmental organizations : International Parenthood Federation,  International Service for Human Rights, Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative  and Civicus - World Alliance for Citizen Participation.The President  of the Council informed that out of 242 recommendations received, 207 enjoyed  the support of Fiji and 35 had been noted.  The Council adopted the  outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Fiji.  The delegation  of San Marino was unable to travel to Geneva due to COVID-19 pandemic.  In  the statement read by Maria Del Socorro Flores Liera, Vice-President of the  Human Rights Council, San Marino said that it would discuss the best way to set  up a national human rights institution.  Because the country had not yet  had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.Cyprus, Iraq,  Libya, Venezuela, Burkina Faso and China, as well as the Centre for Global  Non-Killing spoke in the discussion.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations, 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted ; additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Esmaeil  Baghaei Hamaneh, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations Office  at Geneva, said that Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic to  protect its citizens and the whole humanity.  But, its health capacity was  viciously targeted by the United States' unilateral sanctions and this was  something the Council could not afford to ignore.High Council  for Human Rights of Iran said that the amendment of the law on the punishment  of drug traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.   Torture and ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic  teaching and steps had been taken to strengthen the independence of judges,  access to lawyers and fair trial.Iran's efforts  to provide for refugees despite the challenges it faced and the measures to  empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce infant mortality were  acknowledged.  Several speakers noted that unilateral sanctions were  harmful to the promotion of human rights, especially given the ongoing need to  combat COVID-19 ; others recognized the difficulties in this fight and pledged  their assistance to Iran.  The human rights situation in the country,  including the crackdown on protests in November 2019, remained of  concern.  Speaking in  the discussion were Russia, China, Sri Lanka, Syria, United Kingdom, Venezuela,  Afghanistan, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana and the Philippines.  Also taking  the floor were the following non-governmental organizations : Society of  Iranian Women Advocating Sustainable Development of Environment, Disability  Association of Tavana, Baha'i International Community, Lawyers for Lawyers,  World Jewish Congress, Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, Human  Rights Watch, Rahbord Peimayesh Research and Educational Services Cooperative  and Centre for Inquiry.  The President  of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations received, Iran  supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations ; the Council then adopted the  outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.Margarida Rosa  da Silva Izata, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations Office  at

insecurity in the south of the country, according to some speakers,  warranted a declaration of a state of emergency.Sudan, China,  Afghanistan, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Venezuela and  the Democratic Republic of the Congo took part in the discussion.  Also  speaking were the United Nations Population Fund, as well as International  Volunteerism Organization for Women, Education and Development, Lutheran World  Federation, International Service for Human Rights, Ingenieurs du Monde,  CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation and Rencontre Africaine  pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme.The President  of the Council said that out of 270 recommendations received, 259 enjoyed the  support of Angola and 11 had been noted.  The Council adopted the outcome

of the Council informed that out of 245 recommendations received, 214 enjoyed  the support of Kazakhstan and 31 had been noted.  The Council then adopted  the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan.Summaries of  the Committee's public meetings in English and French are available at the  United Nations Office at Geneva News and Media page, while the webcast can be viewed at UN Web TV.The Council is  holding a full day of meetings today.  It will resume its work at 3 p.m.  to continue its consideration of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review  of Madagascar, Iraq, Slovenia, Egypt, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of FijiNAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, said Fiji had received 242 recommendations, of which it had  accepted 187 following the review.  Having considered the remaining 55  recommendations, Fiji had accepted 20 and noted the rest of the  recommendations.  Fiji placed great importance on the Universal Periodic  Review process and appreciated the immense value of a constructive peer-review  that was informed by the experiences of other States.  Fiji was pleased to  see that the number of States participating in its Universal Periodic Review  had doubled since the second cycle.Human rights  were a catalyst for transformative change and Fiji recognized that the  Universal Periodic Review mechanism and process was a vehicle through which  such change took place.  Following its second Review, Fiji had abolished  the death penalty and ratified all core human rights instruments.  It had  become a State party to the United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime and its three protocols.  The important recommendations  Fiji had received would progressively transform the country and help the  advancement of its human rights journey.  Like other States, Fiji did not  pretend to have all the answers to its challenges, but it recognized the  importance of this peer review process to achieve progress and further  substantive equality and justice.Several  delegations commended the country's strong commitment to combatting the  negative effects of climate change, including its robust legislative framework,  disaster preparedness efforts and measures to strengthen resilience.  Fiji  had strengthened the independence of the judiciary via the 2013 Constitution,  speakers noted and went on to highlight the progress in addressing the  challenges faced by women and girls and victims of trafficking in persons and  the strengthening of the rights of vulnerable groups, children and persons with  disabilities in particular.  They urged Fiji to use the International  Technical Guidelines for Sexual Education in revising the family life education  curriculum.   Fiji had  engaged in open and constructive dialogue with civil society throughout the  review process, they said.  The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders was  being implemented and conditions of human rights defenders had improved.   However, the right to assembly and freedom of expression continued to be  limited, which was why Fiji should repeal the Public Order Amendment Act and  the Media and Industry Development Act.  Since lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender and intersex persons and defenders continued to face threats and harassment,  Fiji should incorporate discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and  gender identity in its anti-discrimination laws.The President  of the Council informed that out of 242 recommendations received, 207 enjoyed  the support of Fiji and 35 had been noted.  NAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, thanked the countries that participated in the Universal Periodic  Review and noted that this process was an important part of the prevention  agenda of the Human Rights Council.  Fiji was encouraged by the number of  recommendations that integrated climate policy with human rights, which  indicated a growing acceptance that national climate policies must take into  account the rights of all persons, especially those disproportionately affected  by climate change.  Ms. Khan acknowledged that her country had to work  hard to integrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex issues into its  national human rights policies.The Council then  adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Fiji.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of San MarinoThe delegation  of San Marino was unable to travel to Geneva due to COVID-19 pandemic.  In  its statement read out by MARIA DEL SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of  the Human Rights Council, San Marino said that during its Universal  Periodic Review, it had received and carefully examined 109  recommendations.  By fully accepting 72 and partially accepting 1  recommendation, San Marino had agreed to ratify the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization conventions and the Agreement on the  Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.  Special  attention was provided to the recommendation to establish a national human  rights institution ; a discussion on the best way to set it up would take place  in the coming years.San Marino had  not accepted recommendations concerning the tightening of anti-discrimination  law and it had noted recommendations related to decriminalization of abortion  and women's participation in political life.  Because the country had not  yet had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.  Finally, recommendation number 101 had  been partially accepted, since setting up a special section for minors was  unnecessary as those tasks were already being carried out by specialized  judges.  A counselling centre for separated parents with children would be  seriously considered, however.In the ensuing  discussion, speakers said they understood the capacity issues faced by San  Marino and hoped that it would nonetheless consider ratifying the International  Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  soon.  The dialogue during the Review had been frank and open and  testified to San Marino's will to implement recommendations.  Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted.  Additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.MARIA DEL  SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of the Human Rights Council,  reading out the statement on behalf of San Marino, thanked all those who spoke  during the debate and noted that San Marino was committed to carefully  considering all the suggestions made.  The recent visit of the head of  State to the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review session had  shown San Marino's commitment to the process.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of IranESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that human rights were a common good that  contributed to human solidarity, without which it would be impossible to  nurture empathy to shield human rights from infringements and  transgressions.  The current international climate was obsessively hostile  to nurturing genuine human solidarity to protect and promote that common  good.  Human rights were the main casualty of today's international  relations.For instance,  while Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic and to protect  its citizens and the whole humanity, its health capacity was viciously targeted  by the United States' unilateral sanctions.  This was something the  Council could not afford to ignore, as it affected the basic rights of the  population.  For years, developing countries were scapegoated for human  rights violations, which were abusively invoked as a tool to stigmatize targeted  nations.  Against this backdrop, the Universal Periodic Review mechanism  was exceptionally important and Iran was one of its main supporters.High Council for Human Rights of Iran said that Iran had received 329 recommendations during its third  Universal Periodic Review cycle, 188 of which had been accepted in whole or  partially.  It did not accept 123 recommendations and had noted 18 which  were in contradiction with the Constitution, Islamic values or cultural  principles.  The abbreviation of life was only considered for the most  serious crimes and the amendment of the law on the punishment of drug  traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.  The  bill on the protection of children and adolescents adopted in 2018 was an  important step forward, while child offenders could be held in a correction  centre for a maximum of five years.  Torture and  ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic teaching, as  well as under Iran's criminal laws and international obligations.  Iran  had taken steps to strengthen the independence of judges, access to lawyer,  fair trial, forbidding arbitrary detention and torture.  Having mostly  accepted the recommendations related to women's rights, Iran had adopted policy  and legislation related to the promotion of women and family life, transfer of  nationality and protection of women from violence.  In the  discussion, the delegations appreciated Iran's cooperation with human rights  mechanisms and the acceptance of the majority of recommendations received.   Iran's efforts to provide for refugees despite challenges it faced and the  efforts to empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce the mortality  rate for children at birth were acknowledged.  Speakers recognized the  difficulties involved in fighting COVID-19 virus and pledged assistance to Iran  in this domain.Several  speakers warned against the political use of the human rights issue and  reiterated that unilateral sanctions were harmful to the promotion of human rights,  especially given the ongoing need to combat COVID-19.  Others remained  deeply concerned at the human rights situation and the repeated refusal by Iran  to allow access to United Nations Special Rapporteurs.  They condemned the  crackdown on protests in November 2019 and remained worried at the ongoing  detention of dual nationals who, given the risks to their health by COVID-19  virus, should be released.The President of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations  received, Iran supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations.ESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said Iran had examined all recommendations with an open  mind and a spirit of cooperation.  Certain recommendations could not be  noted as they amounted to repeated allegations and biased propositions.   Unilateral sanctions pressuring the Iranian people had not distracted the  Government from efforts to safeguard human rights, the right to health,  education and development, as well as children's and women's rights.  The  sanctions by the United States targeted the basic human rights of the entire  Iranian population.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of AngolaMARGARIDA ROSA  DA SILVA IZATA, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that during its last Universal Periodic Review cycle  Angola had received 270 recommendations from 110 States.  Of those, it had  accepted 259 and had taken due note of the remaining 11.  The accepted  recommendations

pandemic.  In  the statement read by Maria Del Socorro Flores Liera, Vice-President of the  Human Rights Council, San Marino said that it would discuss the best way to set  up a national human rights institution.  Because the country had not yet  had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.Cyprus, Iraq,  Libya, Venezuela, Burkina Faso and China, as well as the Centre for Global  Non-Killing spoke in the discussion.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations, 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted ; additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Esmaeil  Baghaei Hamaneh, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations Office  at Geneva, said that Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic to  protect its citizens and the whole humanity.  But, its health capacity was  viciously targeted by the United States' unilateral sanctions and this was  something the Council could not afford to ignore.High Council  for Human Rights of Iran said that the amendment of the law on the punishment  of drug traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.   Torture and ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic  teaching and steps had been taken to strengthen the independence of judges,  access to lawyers and fair trial.Iran's efforts  to provide for refugees despite the challenges it faced and the measures to  empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce infant mortality were  acknowledged.  Several speakers noted that unilateral sanctions were  harmful to the promotion of human rights, especially given the ongoing need to  combat COVID-19 ; others recognized the difficulties in this fight and pledged  their assistance to Iran.  The human rights situation in the country,  including the crackdown on protests in November 2019, remained of  concern.  Speaking in  the discussion were Russia, China, Sri Lanka, Syria, United Kingdom, Venezuela,  Afghanistan, Belarus, Belgium, Botswana and the Philippines.  Also taking  the floor were the following non-governmental organizations : Society of  Iranian Women Advocating Sustainable Development of Environment, Disability  Association of Tavana, Baha'i International Community, Lawyers for Lawyers,  World Jewish Congress, Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, Human  Rights Watch, Rahbord Peimayesh Research and Educational Services Cooperative  and Centre for Inquiry.  The President  of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations received, Iran  supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations ; the Council then adopted the  outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.Margarida Rosa  da Silva Izata, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations Office  at Geneva, said that the accepted recommendations corresponded to the national  priorities anchored in the 2018-2022 Development Plan, aimed at strengthening  legal institutions, improving the sustainable development index and protecting  human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The national strategy on human  rights had been approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2020.  In the  discussions that followed, the delegations welcomed new measures on access to  justice and the adoption of new criminal code and were pleased by the major  progress in poverty elimination, decreasing children mortality rate and the  improvement of the human development index.  Concerns remained about the  excessive use of force against peaceful protesters and human rights defenders,  while food insecurity in the south of the country, according to some speakers,  warranted a declaration of a state of emergency.Sudan, China,  Afghanistan, Botswana, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Venezuela and  the Democratic Republic of the Congo took part in the discussion.  Also  speaking were the United Nations Population Fund, as well as International  Volunteerism Organization for Women, Education and Development, Lutheran World  Federation, International Service for Human Rights, Ingenieurs du Monde,  CIVICUS - World Alliance for Citizen Participation and Rencontre Africaine  pour la Defense des Droits de l'Homme.The President  of the Council said that out of 270 recommendations received, 259 enjoyed the  support of Angola and 11 had been noted.  The Council adopted the outcome  of the Universal Periodic Review of Angola.Zhanar Aitzhanova,  Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations Office at Geneva,  said that her country's priorities included protecting and promoting the rights  of people, developing an inclusive economy and addressing social  problems.  Kazakhstan had recently decided to abolish the death penalty  and had toughened the penalties for the crime of human trafficking.  The  law on peaceful assembly was being revised and Parliament was considering  legislation to ensure political parties included 30 per cent women and  youth.  Kazakhstan had  made progress in eliminating discrimination against women but should  criminalize all forms of violence against women and girls, delegations said in  the discussion.  They welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty and the  establishment of an inter-agency commission to combat trafficking in  persons.  Noting reports of harassment of lawyers, several speakers called  on Kazakhstan to take immediate measures to ensure their full independence.Speaking were  Sri Lanka, Venezuela, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Russia, Burundi, China, Cuba, Egypt  and Iran.  UN Women, United Nations Children's Fund and United Nations  Population Fund also spoke, as did the representatives of the International Bar  Association, Action Canada for Population and Development, Article 19 - The  International Centre Against Censorship, Asian Forum for Human Rights and  Development (joint statement), International Lesbian and Gay Association and  the Alliance Defending Freedom.The President  of the Council informed that out of 245 recommendations received, 214 enjoyed  the support of Kazakhstan and 31 had been noted.  The Council then adopted  the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan.Summaries of  the Committee's public meetings in English and French are available at the  United Nations Office at Geneva News and Media page, while the webcast can be viewed at UN Web TV.The Council is  holding a full day of meetings today.  It will resume its work at 3 p.m.  to continue its consideration of the outcomes of the Universal Periodic Review  of Madagascar, Iraq, Slovenia, Egypt, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of FijiNAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, said Fiji had received 242 recommendations, of which it had  accepted 187 following the review.  Having considered the remaining 55  recommendations, Fiji had accepted 20 and noted the rest of the  recommendations.  Fiji placed great importance on the Universal Periodic  Review process and appreciated the immense value of a constructive peer-review  that was informed by the experiences of other States.  Fiji was pleased to  see that the number of States participating in its Universal Periodic Review  had doubled since the second cycle.Human rights  were a catalyst for transformative change and Fiji recognized that the  Universal Periodic Review mechanism and process was a vehicle through which  such change took place.  Following its second Review, Fiji had abolished  the death penalty and ratified all core human rights instruments.  It had  become a State party to the United Nations Convention against Transnational  Organized Crime and its three protocols.  The important recommendations  Fiji had received would progressively transform the country and help the  advancement of its human rights journey.  Like other States, Fiji did not  pretend to have all the answers to its challenges, but it recognized the  importance of this peer review process to achieve progress and further  substantive equality and justice.Several  delegations commended the country's strong commitment to combatting the  negative effects of climate change, including its robust legislative framework,  disaster preparedness efforts and measures to strengthen resilience.  Fiji  had strengthened the independence of the judiciary via the 2013 Constitution,  speakers noted and went on to highlight the progress in addressing the  challenges faced by women and girls and victims of trafficking in persons and  the strengthening of the rights of vulnerable groups, children and persons with  disabilities in particular.  They urged Fiji to use the International  Technical Guidelines for Sexual Education in revising the family life education  curriculum.   Fiji had  engaged in open and constructive dialogue with civil society throughout the  review process, they said.  The Declaration on Human Rights Defenders was  being implemented and conditions of human rights defenders had improved.   However, the right to assembly and freedom of expression continued to be  limited, which was why Fiji should repeal the Public Order Amendment Act and  the Media and Industry Development Act.  Since lesbian, gay, bisexual,  transgender and intersex persons and defenders continued to face threats and harassment,  Fiji should incorporate discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and  gender identity in its anti-discrimination laws.The President  of the Council informed that out of 242 recommendations received, 207 enjoyed  the support of Fiji and 35 had been noted.  NAZHAT SHAMEEM  KHAN, Permanent Representative of Fiji to the United Nations Office at  Geneva, thanked the countries that participated in the Universal Periodic  Review and noted that this process was an important part of the prevention  agenda of the Human Rights Council.  Fiji was encouraged by the number of  recommendations that integrated climate policy with human rights, which  indicated a growing acceptance that national climate policies must take into  account the rights of all persons, especially those disproportionately affected  by climate change.  Ms. Khan acknowledged that her country had to work  hard to integrate lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex issues into its  national human rights policies.The Council then  adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Fiji.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of San MarinoThe delegation  of San Marino was unable to travel to Geneva due to COVID-19 pandemic.  In  its statement read out by MARIA DEL SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of  the Human Rights Council, San Marino said that during its Universal  Periodic Review, it had received and carefully examined 109  recommendations.  By fully accepting 72 and partially accepting 1  recommendation, San Marino had agreed to ratify the United Nations Educational,  Scientific and Cultural Organization conventions and the Agreement on the  Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.  Special  attention was provided to the recommendation to establish a national human  rights institution ; a discussion on the best way to set it up would take place  in the coming years.San Marino had  not accepted recommendations concerning the tightening of anti-discrimination  law and it had noted recommendations related to decriminalization of abortion  and women's participation in political life.  Because the country had not  yet had an in-depth debate on child adoption by same-sex couples, the related  recommendations had been noted.  Finally, recommendation number 101 had  been partially accepted, since setting up a special section for minors was  unnecessary as those tasks were already being carried out by specialized  judges.  A counselling centre for separated parents with children would be  seriously considered, however.In the ensuing  discussion, speakers said they understood the capacity issues faced by San  Marino and hoped that it would nonetheless consider ratifying the International  Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance  soon.  The dialogue during the Review had been frank and open and  testified to San Marino's will to implement recommendations.  Welcoming the  acceptance of recommendations on the protection of women and children from  violence and cooperation with human rights treaty bodies, speakers urged San  Marino to spare no efforts in implementing them.  San Marino should  continue its efforts to improve living standards, speakers said and welcomed  the fact that there had not been a single violent death nor any fatal road  accident in over five years.The President  of the Council informed that out of 109 recommendations 72 enjoyed the support  of San Marino and 36 had been noted.  Additional clarification had been  provided on one recommendation.MARIA DEL  SOCORRO FLORES LIERA, Vice-President of the Human Rights Council,  reading out the statement on behalf of San Marino, thanked all those who spoke  during the debate and noted that San Marino was committed to carefully  considering all the suggestions made.  The recent visit of the head of  State to the Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic Review session had  shown San Marino's commitment to the process.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of San  Marino.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of IranESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that human rights were a common good that  contributed to human solidarity, without which it would be impossible to  nurture empathy to shield human rights from infringements and  transgressions.  The current international climate was obsessively hostile  to nurturing genuine human solidarity to protect and promote that common  good.  Human rights were the main casualty of today's international  relations.For instance,  while Iran was struggling to contain the Coronavirus pandemic and to protect  its citizens and the whole humanity, its health capacity was viciously targeted  by the United States' unilateral sanctions.  This was something the  Council could not afford to ignore, as it affected the basic rights of the  population.  For years, developing countries were scapegoated for human  rights violations, which were abusively invoked as a tool to stigmatize targeted  nations.  Against this backdrop, the Universal Periodic Review mechanism  was exceptionally important and Iran was one of its main supporters.High Council for Human Rights of Iran said that Iran had received 329 recommendations during its third  Universal Periodic Review cycle, 188 of which had been accepted in whole or  partially.  It did not accept 123 recommendations and had noted 18 which  were in contradiction with the Constitution, Islamic values or cultural  principles.  The abbreviation of life was only considered for the most  serious crimes and the amendment of the law on the punishment of drug  traffickers in 2017 had reduced the death penalty by 90 per cent.  The  bill on the protection of children and adolescents adopted in 2018 was an  important step forward, while child offenders could be held in a correction  centre for a maximum of five years.  Torture and  ill-treatment were forbidden under the Constitution and Islamic teaching, as  well as under Iran's criminal laws and international obligations.  Iran  had taken steps to strengthen the independence of judges, access to lawyer,  fair trial, forbidding arbitrary detention and torture.  Having mostly  accepted the recommendations related to women's rights, Iran had adopted policy  and legislation related to the promotion of women and family life, transfer of  nationality and protection of women from violence.  In the  discussion, the delegations appreciated Iran's cooperation with human rights  mechanisms and the acceptance of the majority of recommendations received.   Iran's efforts to provide for refugees despite challenges it faced and the  efforts to empower women, promote school enrolment and reduce the mortality  rate for children at birth were acknowledged.  Speakers recognized the  difficulties involved in fighting COVID-19 virus and pledged assistance to Iran  in this domain.Several  speakers warned against the political use of the human rights issue and  reiterated that unilateral sanctions were harmful to the promotion of human rights,  especially given the ongoing need to combat COVID-19.  Others remained  deeply concerned at the human rights situation and the repeated refusal by Iran  to allow access to United Nations Special Rapporteurs.  They condemned the  crackdown on protests in November 2019 and remained worried at the ongoing  detention of dual nationals who, given the risks to their health by COVID-19  virus, should be released.The President of the Council informed that out of 329 recommendations  received, Iran supported 142 and noted 186 recommendations.ESMAEIL  BAGHAEI HAMANEH, Permanent Representative of Iran to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said Iran had examined all recommendations with an open  mind and a spirit of cooperation.  Certain recommendations could not be  noted as they amounted to repeated allegations and biased propositions.   Unilateral sanctions pressuring the Iranian people had not distracted the  Government from efforts to safeguard human rights, the right to health,  education and development, as well as children's and women's rights.  The  sanctions by the United States targeted the basic human rights of the entire  Iranian population.The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Iran.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of AngolaMARGARIDA ROSA  DA SILVA IZATA, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that during its last Universal Periodic Review cycle  Angola had received 270 recommendations from 110 States.  Of those, it had  accepted 259 and had taken due note of the remaining 11.  The accepted  recommendations corresponded to the national priorities and programmes anchored  in the 2018-2022 Development Plan, aimed at strengthening legal institutions,  improving the sustainable development index and protecting rights human rights  and fundamental freedoms.  The national strategy on human rights, already  approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2020, would serve as the  political framework for capacity-building to promote and protect human rights  and to address the violations.  The situation of human rights would  periodically be assessed by the National Security Council.  As for the 11  recommendations that Angola had taken note of, the creation of a national human  rights institution in line with the Paris Principles was envisaged.  The  Ombudsman, an independent public institution that defended the rights and  fundamental freedoms of individuals, was in line with the Paris Principles and  it effectively functioned as a national human rights institution.  Angola  was ready to extend an invitation to human rights special procedures.Angola was a  party to the United Nations and African Union conventions against corruption  and was a founding member of the Kimberley Process.  A working group had  been created to assess the compatibility of the Extractive Industry  Transparency Initiative with the domestic legal system.In the  discussion that followed, the delegations welcomed new measures on access to  justice, the adoption of new criminal code and the ratification of a large  number of human rights instruments.  They were also pleased by the  establishment of the national human rights institution and the adoption of the  national human rights strategy, the major progress in poverty elimination,  decreasing children mortality rate and the improvement of the human development  index.  Angola had also improved the presence of women in public life and  taken actions to combat violence against women and girls, notably via the recent  criminalization of female genital mutilation.Concerns,  however, remained with regards to the excessive use of force against peaceful  protesters and human rights defenders ; lack of access to water in urban and  rural areas ; and the food insecurity in the south of the country, which,  according to some speakers, warranted a declaration of a state of  emergency.  Discrimination against persons with disabilities, including  persons with albinism, remained and families with children with disabilities  needed more support.  Angola should furthermore amend article 24 of Family  Code to abolish any exceptions to the prohibition of child marriage.The President  of the Council informed that out of 270 recommendations received, 259 enjoyed  the support of Angola and 11 had been noted.  MARGARIDA ROSA  DA SILVA IZATA, Permanent Representative of Angola to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, thanked the Council for their work and promised to  continue the crusade for the defence of all human rights at regional, national  and the international level.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of  Angola.   Consideration of Outcome of Universal Periodic Review of KazakhstanZHANAR  AITZHANOVA, Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, said that, following the recent elections, a National  Council for Public Trust had been established consisting of representatives of  civil society, to ensure the State was responsive to the needs of  citizens.  Kazakhstan's priorities included protecting and promoting the  rights of people, developing an inclusive economy and addressing social  problems.  The Government  had examined 245 recommendations as part of the review, accepting 214 and  noting 31.  Kazakhstan had recently decided to abolish the death penalty  and had toughened the penalties for the crime of human trafficking, while the  revision of the law on peaceful assembly was ongoing.  As several  recommendations had been made to enhance political participation of women and  youth in the decision-making process, Parliament was considering legislation to  ensure political parties included 30 per cent women and youth.  The Law on  Trade Unions had been amended to better align it with the International Labour  Organization Convention 87.  Unnecessary reporting requirements for  non-governmental organizations were being eliminated and registration  procedures simplified.  Kazakhstan was  committed to the 2030 Agenda and had integrated Sustainable Development Goals  in 80 per cent of the strategic government programs.  As it had received  17 recommendations related to eliminating discrimination based on sexual  orientation and gender identity, it was currently considering a draft law on Family  and Gender Policy.   Furthermore, Kazakhstan was taking steps to  address the rights of migrants, refugees and stateless people.The  delegations welcomed the legislative amendments aimed at improving access to  birth registration procedures to ensure the registration of every child.   Kazakhstan had made progress in eliminating discrimination against women but  should criminalize all forms of violence against women and girls.  Several  speakers welcomed the moratorium on the death penalty, efforts to ensure equal  access to health care services, efforts to help citizens find work and the  establishment of an inter-agency commission to combat trafficking in  persons.  While  Kazakhstan had decided to explicitly prohibit corporal punishment of children,  it had not accepted the recommendations to strengthen the protection of migrant  children.  Some speakers noted reports of harassment of lawyers by members  of the judiciary and law enforcement, calling on Kazakhstan take immediate  measures to ensure full independence of lawyers.  Commending the ongoing  judicial reform, they called on Kazakhstan to ratify the optional protocols to  the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Convention on  the Rights of the Child.  The President  of the Council informed that out of 245 recommendations received, 214 enjoyed  the support of Kazakhstan and 31 had been noted.  ZHANAR  AITZHANOVA, Permanent Representative of Kazakhstan to the United Nations  Office at Geneva, thanked the Council and reiterated the importance of the  Universal Periodic Review process.  Kazakhstan would dedicate all the  necessary resources to implement the recommendations and remained committed to  continuing an open dialogue with the United Nations for the promotion of peace  and the protection of fundamental human rights.  The Council  then adopted the outcome of the Universal Periodic Review of Kazakhstan.___________For use of the

      "Working Group to Review the Human Rights Records in 14 StatesGENEVA (30 October 2019) - The thirty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council\\'s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Working Group will be held in Geneva from 4 to 15 November during which the next group of 14 States are scheduled to have their human rights records examined under this mechanism.The group of States to be reviewed by the UPR Working Group during this session are (in order of scheduled review): Italy, El Salvador, Gambia, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Fiji, San Marino, Kazakhstan, Angola, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Madagascar, Iraq, Slovenia, Egypt and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The meeting will take place in Room XX at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.High-level delegations representing the 14 countries are scheduled to come before the Working Group, which comprises the entire membership of the 47-member Human Rights Council, and other States wishing to take part.  Some 100 States, on average, make recommendations to the State under Review (SuR).  SuRs are expected to present efforts they have made in fulfilling their human rights obligations and commitments, in particular since their last UPR review, assessing both positive developments and identifying challenges. The timetable of State reviews and adoption and distribution of reports can be found below, and online.The thirty-fourth session of the UPR Working Group marks the seventh session held during the third UPR cycle.  During the third UPR cycle, which is focused on implementation and follow up, States are expected to spell out steps they have taken to implement recommendations received during their previous reviews, in particular those which enjoyed their support, as well as present developments that occurred since the previous review and share challenges in their follow-up action.  The reports serving as the basis for these reviews are available online. During the session, an interactive dialogue between the country under review and the Working Group takes place.  Each country review lasts three and one-half hours and an additional half hour for each country will be devoted to the adoption of the recommendations put forward by their peers.  The review for each State is facilitated by groups of three Council members from different regional groups, or troikas, who act as rapporteurs.  The troikas for States to be reviewed throughout the three UPR working group sessions in 2019 were selected through a drawing of lots on 14 January during an organizational meeting of the Council.  \n",

      "  \n",
      "  General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, which created the Human Rights Council, mandated the Council to \"undertake a universal periodic review, based on objective and reliable information, of the fulfilment by each State of its human rights obligations and commitments in a manner which ensures universality of coverage and equal treatment with respect to all States. Subsequently, the Universal Periodic Review mechanism was established through the adoption by the Council of its \"institution-building package\" - HRC resolution 5/1 - on 18 June 2007, one year after its first meeting.  \n",
      "  \n",
      "  The UPR Working Group consequently held its inaugural session in April 2008 for the first group of States, the order for which was decided through the drawing of lots.  With the holding of this first session, the first cycle took off through which all 193 United Nations Member States have had their human rights records reviewed (April 2008 to October 2011).  Subsequently, all 193 States underwent a follow-up review during the second UPR cycle (January 2012 to November 2016).  With the holding of the 27th session of the UPR Working Group in May 2017, the third cycle commenced. \n",
      "  \n",
      "  Per Human Rights Council resolution 16/21 adopted on 25 March 2011 and decision 17/119 pertaining to the review of the Council, the second and subsequent cycles of the UPR should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the accepted recommendations and the developments of the human rights situation in the State under review. As we approach the middle of the third cycle, the UPR has provided OHCHR with an opportunity to strengthen the engagement with all States on the follow-up and implementation of international human rights mechanisms' outcomes, in particular those of the UPR, through cooperative efforts and sharing of best practices among States and stakeholders. While requests for assistance under the Voluntary Fund for UPR Implementation have grown (see please documents 41/28 and 4129), three regional workshops were held last year in Africa (Uganda, Senegal and Cape Verde) on good practices of implementation in the context of the 3rd cycle of the UPR linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (see please emerging good practices as contained in HC report, HRC 41/25, hyperlink please). The implementation of UPR recommendations is expected to result in strengthening national human rights protection systems - not least through a greater engagement of parliaments and other national stakeholders, including NHRIs and NGOs, and in addressing the root causes of human rights violations, and as such, has a preventive effect. The High Commissioner for Human Rights sent letters to foreign ministers of States upon the adoption of their third cycle reviews encouraging their continued engagement in achieving concrete results, especially on the recommendations they have supported; 84 such letters are available online. A matrix of clustered UPR recommendations supported and or noted by the member State is also available together with an infographics with basic information on trends between the second and third cycle as well as in terms of the link between human rights recommendations and the SDGs.   It may be recalled  that the Human Rights Council held a high-level panel discussion on 26 February 2018 session where participants focussed on challenges and opportunities in implementing UPR recommendations in view of strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights at the national level fully integrated with the efforts at the SDGs (summary).UPR Reporting and Objectives\n",
      "  \n",
      "  In accordance with the Council's \"institution-building package\", and as reinforced by the outcome of the Council's review adopted in March 2011, State reviews are based on: information prepared by the State concerned (National Report), submitted by the State and presented orally during the review; information contained in the reports of treaty bodies, Special Procedures, and other relevant UN mechanisms and entities (UN Compilation) to be compiled in a report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); and information provided by other relevant stakeholders to the UPR including non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions, human rights defenders, academic institutions research institutes, regional organizations, also to be summarized by OHCHR in a separate document (Summary of Stakeholders).  \n",

      "   (1) SyriaThe absolutely abhorrent  attack on Khan Shaykun has once again focused international attention on Syria -  and rightly so. If confirmed, the use of chemical weapons by any party to the  conflict would amount to a war crime.Sadly, the attack on Khan Shaykun  was far from an isolated incident. There have been many - too many - other  incidents in various parts of Syria in recent weeks where civilians have  perished. Idleb and Raqqa are among the governorates that have been subjected  to the most intensive bombing to date. In March alone, the UN Human Rights  Office documented that more than 130 civilians had reportedly been killed and a  further 170 injured in Raqqa, and more than 100 killed - a third of them  children - and over 50 injured in Idleb. The overwhelming majority of such  deaths and injuries are reportedly due to airstrikes. Other areas have not been  spared: airstrikes on 3 and 4 April reportedly killed at least 42 civilians -  11 of them women and six children - in Eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus.Civilians in besieged towns,  including in the Damascus suburbs and in Idleb Governorate, continue to die due  to indiscriminate attacks launched from the air and ground, sniper fire and the  denial of water, food and medicine. The UN Human Rights Office documented that  in March at least eight civilians were reportedly killed by snipers in the town  of Madaya, and three civilians killed by ground-based strikes in Al-Fuah. In addition, suicide bombers have  increasingly been targeting areas in Damascus frequented by high number of  civilians, including the central court complex that was one of the targets of a  double bombing on 15 March that left more than 30 people dead. Since August  last year, the Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria has documented seven  attacks involving the use of chlorine by Syrian forces.   All parties to the conflict in  Syria, including foreign states conducting airstrikes, must take constant care  to spare the civilian population by strictly respecting their obligations under  international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of distinction,  proportionality and precautions.  Civilians have paid a brutal  price during this conflict, and we call once again on the international  community, including the Security Council, to set aside political differences  and focus on ensuring that the people of Syria are spared further terror, death  and devastation. Those who are responsible for such grave violations of  international human rights and humanitarian law across the country must be held  to account.\n",
      "   (2) GazaWe condemn in the  strongest terms the execution of three men in Gaza on Thursday, despite our  appeal and those by other international and Palestinian organizations for the  sentences not to go ahead. The defendants had been convicted of treason under  the PLO Revolutionary Penal Code on the basis of what is termed \"collaboration  with the occupier\".These executions were  carried out in breach of Palestine's obligations under international law,  including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which  places stringent conditions on the use of the death penalty.A number of these  conditions were breached in Thursday's executions. The individuals were  convicted of treason, which does not meet the threshold of \"most serious crimes\".  Under international human rights law, these are understood to be intentional  killings. They were civilians convicted by a military court, again in  contravention of international law.We are also concerned that  trials in Gaza resulting in the imposition of a death sentence do not appear to  meet international fair trial standards. Allegations of torture, which the  authorities have not investigated sufficiently, raise the possibility that  confessions may have been coerced. Also, individuals cannot effectively  exercise their right to seek a pardon or have their sentence commuted, as  required by international law. Under Palestinian law, a pardon or commutation  can only be granted by the President. We urge the authorities in  Gaza to halt further executions and comply with Palestine's obligations under  international law. We also call on the State of Palestine to immediately  establish an official moratorium on the use of the death penalty with a view to  its abolition.ENDS \n",

      "We are deeply concerned by the violence in Libya that has led to a number of people being killed and injured in the east of the country, particularly in Benghazi - including people not directly involved in armed clashes. We urge all sides to exercise the utmost restraint to avoid further escalation and engage in peaceful dialogue and we call upon the authorities to renew their efforts to meet their obligations under international human rights law, specifically with respect to protecting the right to life.\n",

This is fundamental to ensuring that the rule of law is upheld and the culture of impunity is not allowed to grow even worse.\n",

      "SUVA  / GENEVA (5 December 2019) - Fiji has good opportunities and strong political  will to realise the right to health - but achieving this goal will depend as  much on addressing violence, discrimination and inequalities as on investment  in its healthcare system, a UN expert said after a visit to the country. \"Fiji  has invested in all the main elements of healthcare, including primary and  specialised care. It has modernised outpatient and hospital care, invested in  infrastructure and increased salaries for medical doctors,\" said the Special  Rapporteur on the right to health, Dainius P\\xc5\\xabras, presenting a preliminary  statement at the end of his eight-day mission. \"I  welcome Fiji's strong political will to ensure that people can realise their  right to health, and I am pleased that it has very good opportunities to do so. \"Of  course it is important to continue investing in a sustainable health care  system with a focus on primary care, but it is equally essential to seriously  address the major determinants of health, such as violence, discrimination and  inequalities that threaten the effective realisation of people's right to  health. \"The  key to success is critical analysis, recognising the current gaps and  identifying the measures needed to close those gaps.\" The  Special Rapporteur said more attention should be paid to violence against women  and children, including implementing existing laws. \"Fiji  should make full use of its existing legislation and policies to combat  violence against women and other vulnerable groups,\" he said. \"This needs  measures that are adequately supported with resources and that are in line with  a human rights-based approach and based on scientific evidence.\" Puras  also highlighted the mental health of the Fijian population as an emerging  priority. \"Psychosocial  interventions for children and adults with mental health conditions should be  available at the community level, and all healthcare workers should be  empowered to be involved in the provision of mental health support and care, in  the same way as they manage physical health conditions,\" said the expert. \"Community-based  rehabilitation services should be developed to support people with  psychosocial, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, in line with the  Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\" The  Special Rapporteur commended the Government of Fiji for its good management of  the recent measles outbreaks. During his visit, from 28 November to 5  December, the expert visited the capital, Suva, and travelled within Viti Levu  and to Nadi, Taveuni and Labasa. The  Special Rapporteur will make a full report to the Human Rights Council in June  2020 on the main findings of his visit.

      "GENEVA (15 September 2016) - The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances said today that is imperative for the Turkish Government to address past violations and that this is \"especially important given the critical period Turkey is living today.\"Presenting the report* on its visit to the country in March 2016, the group of experts noted that so far there has been no political will to recognize and to come to terms with the serious human rights violations occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, including enforced disappearances.\"The current political environment and legal framework, coupled with the so far diffident efforts of the law enforcement and the judiciary to address past enforced disappearances, casts serious doubts on the relatives' possibility to achieve truth, justice and reparation,\" the experts stated. \"Turkey needs to come to terms with its past and turn this page once and for all. This would be particularly important to give a clear signal in the current difficult situation,\" they stressed.  The experts note that important challenges remain to comprehensively address past enforced disappearances and to prevent their recurrence. \"Enforced disappearance has not yet been introduced in the legislation as an autonomous crime; there are virtually no convictions for enforced disappearances, the fate and the whereabouts of many disappeared persons is still unknown, and many of the burial sites have not yet been investigated,\" observed the experts.\"We also expressed concern at the situation in the south-east of the country, where a wide security operation has been in place since July 2015, situation that may facilitate the occurrence of human rights violations, including enforced disappearances,\" they added.The members underlined that the report presented to the Human Rights Council does not reflect information on the attempted coup of 15 July 2016 or on the situation thereafter. \"However, we have jointly with other mandates called on Turkey to uphold its obligations under international human rights law, even in the current time of declared emergency following the attempted coup.\"\"The Working Group stands ready to continue closely cooperating with the Government of Turkey and to provide its technical assistance as appropriate,\" the experts concluded.  \n",

      "GENEVA (14 September 2017)  - The UK risks sliding into worsening air pollution and looser environmental  standards after Brexit, potentially becoming a haven for \"dirty\" industries and  a dumping ground for products failing to meet EU regulations, a United Nations  Special Rapporteur has warned.Baskut Tuncak, whose  mandate focuses on hazardous substances and wastes, told the Human Rights  Council in Geneva that the EU had some of the highest environmental standards  in the world and he feared these would not be maintained.\"The UK Government's  decision to trigger Article 50 without clarifying the technical details of the  transposition of EU law may pose a real danger the country will be left without  a clear framework to ensure similar levels of protection to those currently  provided by the EU,\" he said, presenting a report on the overall situation in the UK. \"The Government has  conveyed to me that it is confident it can address these issues, but there are  concerns it has under-estimated the extra burden on environmental regulators  trying to replace the role of various EU bodies.\"\"Brexit poses a risk of  potential regression from human rights standards, which is at odds with the UK's  international obligations,\" the Special Rapporteur said.\"The lack of clear  guarantees, in particular to keep up with presumably strengthening EU standards  of health and environmental protection over the coming years, and ministerial  statements that existing laws would be maintained 'wherever practical and  desirable', are worrying.\"Air pollution and industry  regulation also posed significant challenges post-Brexit, the Special  Rapporteur noted.\"Should the Government  fail to equal the EU on air quality controls, chemical restrictions or product  manufacturing standards, the UK market could risk becoming a haven for 'dirty'  industries and a dumping ground for products failing to meet EU regulations,\"  said Mr. Tuncak.EU membership had \"undoubtedly\"  strengthened human rights protection in the UK, he said. For example, the UK  had significantly lowered sulphur dioxide emissions, previously the highest in  the EU, and improved waste disposal and sewage treatment practices.Mr. Tuncak said his visit  to the UK in January 2017 had found that people who needed the most protection  were often breathing in dangerous levels of toxic pollution.\"Air pollution continues  to inflict grave harms on the rights of children, women, older persons and  people with disabilities, with limited accountability for perpetrators  globally,\" he said. Among the poor and minorities, the risk is often magnified,  he added. The UK Government should  urgently develop and implement measures to reduce toxic emissions and improve  air quality, the Special Rapporteur said.\"The new 2017 Air Quality  Plan fails to bring the necessary urgency and concrete commitment to improve  air quality and reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants as quickly as  possible,\" he noted. \"The UK has an obligation to protect its population from  exposure to health hazards, including air pollution, and to ensure effective  remedies when violations occur.\"Mr. Tuncak also unveiled  new guidelines to help all States and businesses  prevent and redress the adverse impacts on human rights of hazardous substances  and waste, including pollution.   ENDSMr. Baskut Tuncak (Turkey) was appointed as  Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the environmentally sound  management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes by the UN  Human Rights Council in 2014. As Special Rapporteur, he is part of what is  known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

      "\\xe2\\x80\\x8bSpanishGENEVA (1 July 2019) - UN High Commissioner for  Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said Monday she is deeply concerned by the death  in custody in Venezuela of retired navy Captain Rafael Acosta Arevalo,  allegedly after he had been tortured. She stressed that it is imperative the  Venezuelan authorities conduct a prompt, thorough, effective, independent,  impartial and transparent investigation into his death.Captain Rafael Acosta Arevalo was detained on  21 June by unidentified armed men and his whereabouts were unknown for seven  days. Given that his relatives and lawyers were not informed of his whereabouts  despite repeated requests, his case may also constitute an enforced  disappearance, prohibited under international law. On 28 June, he was brought before a military  tribunal by members of the Directorate General of Military Counterintelligence  (DGCIM), along with four other military officers and two former security  officers accused of plotting to assassinate President Nicol\\xc3\\xa1s Maduro Moros.  According to his lawyer, Captain Acosta Arevalo was brought before the judge in  a wheelchair, was unable to speak, and showed clear signs of having been  tortured. The judge sent him to a military hospital, where he died in the early  hours of 29 June. Despite numerous requests, neither his family nor his lawyer  have been given access to his body.\"I  am shocked by the alleged torture of Captain Acosta Arevalo, and that his  treatment in custody may have been the cause of his death. I remind the Venezuelan authorities that they are responsible for the life, and the physical and  psychological integrity of all people deprived of their liberty,\" Bachelet said. \"I urge the authorities to conduct an in-depth  investigation - including an autopsy meeting international standards - that is  both independent and transparent. This is essential to shed light not only on  what happened to him, but in order to facilitate bringing to justice those  responsible for his death,\" Bachelet said.While she welcomed the swift action by the  Attorney-General's Office in opening an investigation into Captain Acosta  Arevalo's death, and noted that two members of the DGCIM have been charged with  first-degree murder, she regretted that the allegations of torture do not appear  to be included in the charges. \"I  also call on the Venezuelan authorities to allow the other six military and  former security officers detained along with Captain Acosta Arevalo to receive  visits from their lawyers and relatives, to ensure they are treated with  humanity and dignity and are protected from torture and other forms of  ill-treatment,\" Bachelet said. \"Structural measures  should also be urgently adopted to prevent the recurrence of torture and other ill-treatment  of people held in custody by the State.\" ENDFor more information and media requests, please  contact: Rupert Colville - + 41 22 917  9767 / rcolville@ohchr.orgor Ravina Shamdasani - + 41 22 917 9169 / rshamdasani@ohchr.org or Marta  Hurtado - +  41 22 917 9466 / mhurtado@ohchr.org.Tag and share  - Twitter: @UNHumanRights and Facebook: unitednationshumanrights\n",

Background on the Convention and the CommitteeThe Convention, adopted unanimously by the General Assembly in 1984, entered into force on 26 June 1987.  States parties to the Convention are required to outlaw torture and no \"exceptional circumstances\" maybe invoked as a justification for acts of torture nor \"higher orders\" could be an excuse for perpetrators.  The Convention introduced two significant new elements to the United Nations fight against torture: first, it specifies that alleged torturers shall be tried in a State party if not  extradited to face trial in another State, therefore ensuring that there are no safe havens for perpetrators of acts of torture who shall not escape justice; secondly, under article 20, it provides for an inquiry, including a visit to the State party concerned, with its agreement, if the Committee receives reliable information, which appears to contain well-founded indications, that torture is being systematically practiced in the territory of that State party.Under article 21, a State party to the Convention may at any time declare that it recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications to the effect that a State party claims that another State party is not fulfilling its obligations under the Convention.Under article 22, a State party to the Convention may at any time declare that it recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications from, or on behalf of, individuals subject to its jurisdiction who claim to be victims of a violation by a State party of the provisions of the Convention.The Convention has been ratified or acceded to by the following 157 States: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada,

States of America have recognized the competence of the Committee under article 21 only.  Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burundi, Guatemala, Mexico, Morocco, and Seychelles have recognized the competence of the Committee under article 22 only.Optional Protocol to the Convention against TortureThe Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, which entered into force on 22 June 2006, established a system of regular visits by independent bodies to places where persons are or may be deprived of their liberty, in order to prevent torture and other forms of ill-treatment.  The Optional Protocol's innovative two-pillar approach relies on an international body, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (SPT), which is composed of 25 independent Experts, as well as national bodies for the prevention of torture (national preventive mechanisms - NPMs), which must be established or designated by each State party.  As of  13 April 2015, 77 States had ratified or acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment: Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Denmark, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Liberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, Nauru, Netherlands, Niger, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Senegal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain        , Sweden, Switzerland, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom and Uruguay.Other United Nations Activities against Torture In addition to preventive measures, the United Nations has taken action to come to the aid of torture victims.  In 1981 the General Assembly set up the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Torture.  The Commission on Human Rights, and now the Human Rights Council, repeatedly appeal to all Governments, organizations and individuals in a position to do so to contribute to the Fund in order to allow it to respond to the constantly increasing number of requests for assistance.In accordance with article 26 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, a Special Fund has been set up to help finance the implementation of the recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture (SPT) after its visit to a State party, as well as education programmes of the National Preventive Mechanisms.  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in resolution 1985/33, decided to appoint an independent expert, a Special Rapporteur, to examine questions relevant to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  The mandate, which has subsequently been extended by the Human Rights Council, most recently in resolution 16/23, covers all countries, irrespective of whether a State has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The mandate comprises three main activities: transmitting urgent appeals to States with regard to individuals reported to be at risk of torture, as well as communications on past alleged cases of torture; undertaking fact-finding country visits; and submitting annual reports on activities, the mandate and methods of work to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. Membership and Officers of the CommitteeThe Committee\\'s members are elected by the States parties to the Convention and serve in their personal capacity.  The current members of the Committee are: Essadia Belmir (Morocco); Alessio Bruni (Italy); Satyabhoosun Gupt Domah (Mauritius); Felice Gaer (United States); Abdoulaye Gaye (Senegal); Claudio Grossman (Chile); Jens Modvig (Denmark); Sapana Pradhan-Malla (Nepal); George Tugushi (Georgia); and Kening Zhang (China).  Mr. Grossman is the Chairperson.  The Vice-Chairpersons are Ms. Belmir, Ms. Gaer and Mr. Tugusi.  Mr. Domah is the Rapporteur.

      "ASTANA / GENEVA (12  September 2017) - Kazakhstan has shown a strong commitment to advancing the  rights of persons with disabilities, UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of  persons with disabilities Catalina Devandas said in a statement at the end of her official visit  to the country. \"The positive steps to  reform Kazakhstan's social protection system and provide universal health  coverage are a clear indication of this,\" she said. The expert also  acknowledged initial efforts to improve accessibility for persons with  disabilities.  She noted that more  efforts are required to fully include persons with disabilities in society,  particularly in the areas of education, legal capacity and political  participation, and to end institutionalization and involuntary treatment. The  Special Rapporteur recognised the openness of the Government to engage in a  constructive dialogue on how to address those remaining challenges.Ms. Devandas called on the  State to bring its national legislation on legal capacity and mental health in  line with international human rights standards. \"Today, people deprived of  their legal capacity are not allowed to vote in elections, and risk being irreversibly  deprived of their reproductive rights by means of sterilization,\" she said. She highlighted the fact  that provisions allowing for involuntary placement in mental health facilities  or long-term social care institutions and forcing persons with disabilities to  undergo medical interventions without consent are contrary to the Convention on  the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  The expert acknowledged  the State's initial efforts to move people out of institutions, through pilot  projects managed by civil society. However, the process is slow and the numbers  of persons de-institutionalized remain insignificant. \"Kazakhstan needs to move  fast in establishing a comprehensive deinstitutionalization reform to phase out  institutional care and facilitate the transition to living in the communities,\"  the Special Rapporteur said.The expert noted that the  country has yet to make progress in providing inclusive education. Efforts to  include children with disabilities in regular classrooms are still at a pilot  stage and need to be scaled-up. During the visit, the expert observed that  support services for most children with disabilities are not available, and  that they are home-schooled. \"Home schooling should be  an exceptional and temporary measure to support children whose health does not  allow them to attend school, rather than a practice to further segregate  children with disabilities,\" she explained. Ms. Devandas highlighted  the important role played by representative organisations of persons with  disabilities in informing the reform process, and acknowledged their role to  monitor their implementation as well as compliance with the Convention. She also encouraged the  State to establish an independent national mechanism to monitor the implementation  of such reforms and to provide funding to independent organisations\", she  concluded. The Special Rapporteur  will present a detailed report of her findings and recommendations at the 37th  session of the Human Rights Council in March 2018. ENDSMs Catalina Devandas  Aguilar (Costa Rica) took office as the first Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Persons with  Disabilities on 1 December 2014. Her mandate recalls the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and  interrelatedness of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the need for  persons with disabilities to be guaranteed the full enjoyment of these rights  and freedoms without discrimination. It signals that further attention is  needed to address the barriers that persons with disabilities continue to face  in all parts of the world in their participation as equal members of society.As a Special Rapporteur,  Ms. Devandas is part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.  Special Procedures, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human  Rights system, is the general name of the Council's independent fact-finding  and monitoring mechanisms that address either specific country situations or  thematic issues in all parts of the world. Special Procedures experts work on a  voluntary basis; they are not UN staff and do not receive a salary for their  work. They are independent of any government or organization and serve in their  individual capacity.

      "BANGUI / GENEVA (26 June 2015) - The United Nations Independent Expert on the human rights situation in the Central African Republic, Marie-Ther\\xc3\\xa8se Keita Bocoum, called on the international community to redouble its efforts to help the country to fully realize its transition to peace, national reconciliation, reconstruction and the end of impunity.Following a seven-day visit to the country (16 to 23 June 2015), the human rights expert congratulated the Central Africans for the important steps taken in favor of peace, national reconciliation and to fight against impunity.\"The Central African Republic has demonstrated its commitment in favor of peace, national reconciliation and justice in adopting the Republican Pact at the end of Bangui Forum, which defines a consensual road map for the country,\" Ms. Keita Bocoum said, calling on all parties to pursue their efforts to implement the Pact and fulfill people's expectations.The Independent Expert noted that an electoral calendar has been set, but warned that \"many challenges remain.\" \"National authorities, with the support of MINUSCA, launched an important signal regarding the fight against impunity during the arrests of three prominent leaders of rebel groups late 2014 and early 2015,\" she said. \"However, those responsible for the most egregious violations of human rights must be apprehended rapidly for the fight against impunity to be effective and to avoid negative impact on the socio-political climate, as it was the case in the past.\"The expert also emphasized that the provision of identity cards and registration of displaced persons and refugees during the census as well as their participation in the elections will be significant challenges but essential to the legitimacy of the election.Ms. Keita Bocoum has nevertheless expressed her concern at ongoing acts of violence against civilians perpetrated by armed elements, which continue to threaten civilians despite recent agreements on the cessation of hostilities and a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration program. The Independent Expert, who visited the women's prison and the central prison Ngaragba in Bangui, noted that conditions of detention have improved overall in those two detention centers since his last visit. \"However, too many detainees are held without charge and many others are awaiting trial far beyond the deadline. The prisoners have no access to adequate health care and suffer from lack of activity in prisons.\"The rights expert was alerted of cases of witchcraft involving torture for those accused, often vulnerable women. \"During my last visit, I had already warned the authorities about these unacceptable practices, contrary to national and international laws.\"\n",
      "\"I urge the authorities to take their responsibility and arrest all those responsible for these crimes and to initiate a national debate on this issue, including on the existing provisions, in order to find solutions respecting the universal standards of human rights,\" Ms. Keita Bocoum said.During her visit, the UN expert travelled within the country, including Bria and Boali, where she met local authorities and representatives of civil society. \"The State remains insufficiently represented outside the capital and is not able to impose its authority and ensure people's security,\" she said.\n",
      "\"In Bria, there is still no judicial authority and only one single police commissioner supported by four policemen. This is obviously far from sufficient especially when some armed militias continue to operate,\" she warned.The expert also stressed the importance of taking all necessary measures to protect children against violence and abuse, especially those who are vulnerable, for example in the displacement camp of Mpoko, which the expert visited.\n",
      "\"When violations are reported, the responsible authorities must protect victims from further harm, prosecute the alleged perpetrators and provide reparations,\" she said.The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in the Central African Republic will present a comprehensive report and her recommendations to the Human Rights Council in September.\n",

      "PORT-AU-PRINCE (26 October  2016)  - The Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti, Gustavo Gall\\xc3\\xb3n, has concluded his sixth official mission to Haiti to monitor the human rights situation within the current political context. The Independent Expert has reiterated his solidarity with the victims of hurricane Matthew and with the Haitian people. \"The violation of rights in Haiti due to natural disasters is one of the five priority areas I have highlighted in my previous reports. Therefore, I have gone to Jeremie, in the Grand'Anse department, where I visited the High School Nord Alexis, where 525 families affected by the cyclone have found shelter. Their situation is similar to the situation of internally displaced people living in camps since the 2010 earthquake, of people deported from the Dominican Republic settled along the border, or of detainees in the country's prisons,\" said Mr. Gall\\xc3\\xb3n. He stressed that efforts should be redoubled to address the needs of those affected by this catastrophe.Since his previous mission in Haiti last February and March 2016, the Independent Expert has welcomed the peaceful transition from the last Presidency to the current Provisional Presidency as well as the efforts made by the Government to ensure the elections go ahead. However, as a result of hurricane Matthew the election date of October 9 has been postponed and \"Matthew will also affect the new date of November 20 since many people affected by the hurricane will have difficulties participating\", according to the Independent Expert. He has stressed that the Government has a duty to hold the elections under difficult circumstances but he is optimistic that the new Provisional Electoral Council and the more relaxed political environment compared to last year will allow the electoral process to be concluded. \"I hope that these elections will be held without any surprises and that there will be a new President elected in February next year as well as stable State institutions,\" Mr. Gall\\xc3\\xb3n said.Regarding long pre-trial detention, the Independent Expert has taken note of the creation of a Presidential Commission to address this serious human rights violation. He has reiterated to the Ministry of Justice the need to urgently take measures to abolish long pre-trial detention and to reform the judiciary. Mr. Gall\\xc3\\xb3n has visited the new women's prison built in Cabaret. Although \"this prison is an example of a not overcrowded facility, the building lacks safe drinking water, privacy is not ensured in the showers and toilets, the time allocated for outside recreation of inmates is limited to three hours a week in a courtyard, and the dining room is not used,\" he said. He stated that more should be done to improve prison conditions in order to guarantee the detainees' dignity.The Independent Expert has reiterated his recommendation to tackle illiteracy in a reasonably short time. \"It is not necessary to spend a large amount of money to be successful in this endeavour, but especially to organize a campaign based on the Government's decision to eliminate the problem thoroughly and quickly,\" he said. Mr. Gall\\xc3\\xb3n has invited the Government to resume an education plan developed in 2010 and resumed in 2011, which foresaw the elimination of illiteracy in the country within five years.He has also stressed his recommendations to create a commission of truth, justice and reparation of violations of the past, and a similar commission to compensate victims of cholera. \"We must bring justice to victims of past violations and to people who have suffered the consequences of cholera to achieve a more equal society, based on justice,\" he said.The Independent Expert concluded by declaring his outrage over verbal and physical attacks against the LGBTI community, following the ban on the Massi Madi international festival organized by this community. \"These attacks are contrary to the rights to equality and non-discrimination which are recognized in international treaties to which Haiti is a party. I urge both the authorities and society to respect them.\" Mr. Gall\\xc3\\xb3n will present his report to the Human Rights Council in March 2017 and hopes to show progress concerning the implementation of his recommendations.  \n",

      "GENEVA (13 February 2015) - The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Christof Heyns, today urged the Indonesian Government to halt further executions of people convicted of drug-related offenses. Earlier this week, Indonesian officials announced that eight convicted drug traffickers would be executed by firing squad in the coming days.\n",
      "\"Under international law, the death penalty is regarded as an extreme form of punishment which, if it is used at all, should only be imposed for the most serious crimes, that is, those involving intentional killing, and only after a fair trial, among other safeguards,\" Mr. Heyns stressed.\n",
      "\"However, despite, several appeals by UN human rights experts and civil society organisations urging the Indonesian Government to reconsider imposing the death penalty for drug related offences, the authorities decided to execute six people by firing squad on 18 January 2015,\" he noted. \n",
      "According to available information, the 14 persons slated for execution in January - February 2015, did not get a fair trial. Twelve of them are foreign nationals who generally have no adequate interpreting services, the right to a translator or a lawyer at all stages of trial and appeal.\n",
      "\"Any death sentence must comply with international obligations related to the stringent respect of fair trial and due process guarantees, as stipulated in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Indonesia is a State party,\" the human rights expert stressed. \n",
      "\"I previously expressed concerns over the imposition of death penalty for drug related offenses, and that such death sentences undertaken in contravention of Indonesia's international human rights obligations is tantamount to an arbitrary execution\", Mr. Heyns said. \n",
      "\"I have urged Indonesia to restrict the use of the death penalty in compliance with its international obligations,\" the expert said. \"I regret that the authorities continue to execute people in violation of international human rights standards.\" \n",
      "The Special Rapporteur noted that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases. \"All necessary measures, including clemency, should be adopted to halt further executions in the country,\" he said. \n",
      "\"I urge the Government of Indonesia to establish a moratorium on execution with a view of its complete abolition, in order to comply with the international move towards the abolition of the death penalty,\" the expert concluded.\n",

I would like to begin my comments by saying that no country can be fully prepared for the devastating impact of a disaster such as Typhoon Haiyan and the tragic loss of life and property that accompanied it. I offer my sincere condolences to the Government and to the people of the Philippines. My visit allowed me to witness first-hand the extraordinary efforts to rebuild devastated communities as well as the resilience of displaced persons which offers an example to us all. \n",
      "The Government has much to be commended for with regard to its responses to Typhoon Haiyan. It has shown leadership and put in place institutional and policy structures and frameworks that have proved to be effective in the immediate crisis response period and as the national and local authorities and displaced persons alike began the difficult process of rebuilding shattered lives either in their former places of origin or in new displacement locations. Through this difficult and challenging time the Philippines has developed much valuable experience to share with the international community and with specific States in all regions that may be affected by similar crises. This experience can benefit us all as we collectively seek to strengthen our ability to prevent and respond to the effects of climate change related disasters that sadly seem to be ever more frequent. \n",
      "Government policies, for example the 'Build-Back-Better' policy are designed not only to respond to disasters, but to mitigate against the effects of future climate change induced displacement in this region, which is prone to disasters. In Tacloban and Tanauan I was impressed by the efforts of the local government officials and with some of the transitional and permanent housing solutions that have been put in place and that recognize the need for IDPs to have good quality and appropriate shelter and housing that also allows them to maintain their livelihoods or transition to new livelihood options. Those whom I met expressed their general satisfaction with the shelter or housing and services provided to them, including the provision of healthcare services, education for their children and support for the development of livelihood activities. I was however concerned to learn of financial constraints on authorities that have impacted on their ability to move forward towards durable solutions for all those affected and to resolve immediate issues related to adequate provision of basic services. It is essential for national and local governments to sustain and, where necessary, enhance their activities to address both immediate needs and ensure durable solutions for IDPs.\n",
      "Significant challenges for IDPs remain to be resolved in areas affected by Typhoon Haiyan. Some people have found themselves having to relocate two or more times since their initial displacement. Many families remain housed in collective \"bunkhouses\" that do not meet necessary minimum standards for the provision of basic needs and services and create numerous safety and protection challenges, particularly for women and girls who face threats including sexual abuse and early pregnancy, as well as failing to provide conditions of privacy and dignity. IDPs in various areas pointed to a lack of adequate police presence which contributes to the overall feelings of increased insecurity given the nature of their shelter and conditions. Regrettably some families seem to have fallen through the protection safety net and remain living in substandard shelter in areas designated as 'no-build' or 'hazardous' due to the likelihood of future hazards. I was informed by IDPs and their representatives that, in both temporary and permanent housing, the provision of water, adequate sanitation and electricity remain seriously problematic. A common concern expressed to me was the need to increase the level of consultation and information flow to IDPs to ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and included in future planning and their rights respected. \n",
      "While the Government is to be commended in terms of its immediate responses, its attention to ensuring sustainable durable solutions for IDPs remains inadequate to-date. I believe that profiling, a full needs assessment and verification exercise is required during this crucial transition period between early recovery and the attainment of durable solutions. I was concerned to learn that funding shortfalls and political challenges, including inadequate cooperation between national and local governments, are delaying processes towards achieving durable solutions. While infrastructure and public projects such as the building of flood defences in Tacloban are necessary and legitimate, the highest priority must continue to be given to securing durable housing that meet required standards and livelihood solutions for affected communities. Regrettably it appears that funding and attention to IDPs is waning. The national Government, together with its local Government partners must ensure that it follows through on the assistance that it has provided to-date to ensure that it truly meets the needs and rights of all those displaced. \n",
      "The Draft Bill No. 4744 on Protecting the rights of Internally Displaced Persons has been under discussion for more than a decade and the second attempt to have it passed remains in the hands of the Senate. Previously adopted in 2013, a version of the draft law was subsequently vetoed by the President on the grounds of some elements being unconstitutional or requiring further clarification. As the technicalities concerning this proposed law seem to have been resolved, it is urgent to pass this Bill into law at the earliest opportunity witthout further delay. For the Philippines, which is both prone to disasters and enduring the effects of long-standing conflicts, it is particularly important to enshrine the rights of IDPs in domestic law. Not to do so sends a wrong signal about the commitment of the Government to ensuring the rights of IDPs, whether displaced by natural disaster, conflict or development and withholds essential legal protection from them. If passed the Bill would constitute a landmark national law, based on the UN 1998 Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement and best practices. It would provide a valuable domestic legal elaboration of the rights of internally displaced persons and the primary responsibility of the Government to protect them. It would help to remove existing administrative gaps, obstacles and uncertainties and establish criminal responsibility for acts of arbitrary displacement by both State and non-State actors.\n",
      "My visit was to address not only displacement caused by disasters, but also other forms of displacement around the country. In this context I visited Zamboanga in Mindanao where people remain displaced following the 2013 clash between a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and government security forces which resulted in approximately 120,000 displaced persons. I visited a number of transitional settlements as well as newly constructed permanent housing for the return of some affected communities. I note some important progress by the authorities including a Code of Beneficiaries Policy, creation of some permanent housing and progress towards durable solutions for some displaced communities. Nevertheless I am concerned by some issues including the closure of the Grandstand, where families had taken refuge after the crisis, just priort to my visit without ensuring adequate housing solutions for some families who did not want to move to transitional shelter and wished to return to their original locations. The designation of 'no-build' and 'no-return' areas on the grounds of disaster risk reduction has further restricted return to some locations. \n",
      "The main transitional site of Mampang is problematic on many levels. It lacks adequate provision of water, electricity, adequate access to essential and basic services including health care and education. There are regular reports of security incidents and it is located at a considerable distance from the city and IDPs places of origin making access to livelihoods extremely difficult. For these reasons Mampang must not be considered a long-term solution for the IDPs. Permanent housing must be finalised urgently and it must be equipped with basic utilities and accessible to adequate services, security and comply with national building standards and codes. The Government must ensure that its responses do not differentiate against any displaced community on the basis of their identity or belonging to a minority community and fully respect the right to freedom of movement. \n",
      "Initiatives to provide permanent housing must also take into account the wishes of IDP communities in regard to location, materials and access to livelihoods, for example access to the sea for fishing-based communities. I was informed that some indigenous fishing communities had had their homes damaged or destroyed during the military operations. While eventually being able to return to their locations, they have yet to receive support from the Government to rebuild their houses or re-establish their livelihoods in fishing and seaweed farming. Families who returned to the area of Lupa Lupa from the Grandstand are in a particularly perilous situation lacking adequate shelter and basic assistance and their needs should be immediately addressed. Equally the authorities have not recognized many families as legitimate or 'tagged' IDPs from conflict areas with serious implications for continuing assistance and support for those families. I urge all relevant authorities to take an inclusive approach and to ensure adequate housing, services and support for all, without discrimination. \n",
      "I visited Cotabato City and had hoped to visit various areas in Maguindanao which have long been affected by conflict induced displacement. Regrettably, security issues and Government sensitivities in this region limited my access to the locations that I had wished to visit in Maguindanao. On-going conflict between the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and non-State armed groups in the region repeatedly cause both large and smaller-scale displacement. Some described the situation as a \"forgotten crisis\" and noted the frequency and nature of the displacement and that responses by both national and regional government authorities were routinely inadequate. For many in this region displacement has become the the pattern of life. The UN and other international actors have insufficient resources and little capacity to respond adequately to the situation in the region. A viable, inclusive and comprehensive peace process is essential to removing the causes of displacement and to stabilizing the situation in the region. Adoption of the Bangsamoro Basic Law, intended to establish the Bangsamora political entity in the country and replace the existing Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, may also assist in this regard. In the meantime the humanitarian responses of the Government must be strengthened in order for IDPs to benefit from stronger assistance and protection. \n",
      "Indeed it was evident to me that the Government's response to conflict-induced displacement in locations such as Zamboanga and Cotabato differs significantly to its commendable response to disaster and climate change induced displacement elsewhere as evident in the condition of some of the transitional and permanent shelter options provided to IDPs. I was struck by the disparity between the permanent housing established in Tacloban and that of Zamboanga. It is essential that the Government ensures that the National Housing Authority provides equitable and comparable permanent housing as a component of durable solutions for all IDPs across the country.\n",
      "I also visited Koronadal and Tampakan in South Cotabato Province in order to consult on an issue of potential displacement due to a proposed open-pit mining project in Tampakan. It is reported that this project would lead to the displacement of over 5000 individuals, the majority of whom are indigenous peoples, from their recognized ancestral lands if it goes ahead. The project has been put on hold by the Governor of South Cotabato and the indigenous communities expressed their fear that the project would eventually proceed despite their objections and desire to remain on their ancestral lands. They expressed frustration that consultation processes, including a process of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) had not been conducted transparently, was not fully inclusive of their chosen tribal leaders nor had it taken adequate account of their broader views and rights to the land and to the maintenance of their indigenous cultures and lifestyles. It is important to emphasize that the legitimate concerns and rights of indigenous peoples must not be side-lined but should be given the upmost priority as indicated in the Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA). The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement require a threshold of \"compelling and overriding public interest\" in order for development-induced displacement to take place. This does not appear to be apparent in this case. I was alarmed that tribal leaders reported that their communities were consistently being manipulated and divided and that they had been harassed and received threats when they expressed their opposition. Indeed some leaders and members of the indigenous communities have been killed over the past years reportedly due to their anti-mining activities.\n",
      "It was striking to me that indigenous peoples have been particularly vulnerable to conflict-induced displacement in many regions, particularly in Mindanao. For example, I am concerned by the plight of some 700 indigenous peoples currently living in basic Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) church run facilities in the city of Davao having been displaced from their ancestral homes for several months due to long-standing conflict between the government and the New People's Army (NPA) in their region. I travelled to Davao to consult the national and local authorities and the indigenous peoples themselves on this situation. I heard from the AFP its assertion that it is seeking to protect the communities and provide services to them in conflict regions; however the displaced IPs made it clear that it is their presence and that of the paramilitary groups in their communities that continues to create anxiety amongst the indigenous communities. The community wishes to return to its lands but stressed to me that they will only feel safe to do so if the long-term militarization of their region comes to an end and they can return with guarantees of safety, dignity and protection. They described to me their concerns including their alleged forced recruitment into paramilitary groups, known as Alamara, under the auspices of the AFP and harassment in the context of the on-going conflict between the AFP and the NPA. Schools have reportedly been closed and/or occupied by the AFP or Alamara, hampering the access to education of indigenous children. While tribal leaders informed me that they are not being detained against their will at the UCCP centre in Davao, as is evident by reports of their periodic return to their communities, their current situation is neither acceptable nor sustainable. It is essential to find a rapid and peaceful solution to their situation in full consultation with their legitimate leaders, with their voluntary and secure return to their ancestral lands being a high priority. I urge the Government, in consultation with indigenous peoples themselves, to give greater attention to addressing the causes of displacement whether it be due to the militarization of their areas or due to development projects. \n",
      "This situation clearly demonstrates the massive and potentially irreversible impact of the on-going conflicts on displacement of such vulnerable communities who are often caught up in the conflict and suspected of involvement with armed groups. Displacement, whether due to conflict or development, not only destroys the homes and livelihoods of indigenous peoples, but has an incalculable impact on their cultures and ways of life that are part of the rich and diverse heritage of the Philippines that must be protected or otherwise lost, perhaps forever. Indigenous peoples are poorly equipped to survive away from their ancestral lands and are therefore deeply affected by displacement. The needs of these vulnerable people must be assessed, with their full participation, so as to provide essential assistance for them, including durable solutions which are culturally sensitive and appropriate, when displacement has taken place. The displacement of such communities whose very lives and cultures are intimately entwined with their ancestral lands and environments must only be a matter of last resort. It is clear to me that existing legislation and institutions, including the exemplary Indigenous Peoples Rights Act cannot provide adequate protection from displacement unless fully implemented in practice. Specific provisions on the rights of indigenous peoples should be included in the IDP Law currently under consideration.\n",
      "In conclusion I would like once again to thank the Government of the Philippines for its cooperation with my mandate. My full report and recommendations based on my visit will be presented to the Government and to the Human Rights Council at its 32nd session in June 2016. In the meantime I look forward to continuing my constructive dialogue with the Government and to identifying areas of practical engagement. I would also like to thank the United Nations Office of the Resident Coordinator, OHCHR, UNHCR, UNICEF and OCHA amongst other UN agencies for their work to facilitate my visit in all respects. I am also grateful to the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines and the many civil society organizations that provided information to me and assisted me in the course of my visit. Not least I wish to thank the many internally displaced persons and their leaders and representatives who took the time to travel and meet with me, conveying their stories, challenges and hopes for the future.\n",

      "We are concerned at the continued and increasing use of administrative detention by Israeli authorities against Palestinians. Administrative detainees are held without charge or trial, often on the basis of secret evidence, for periods of up to six months, which are extendable indefinitely. Detainees are also often transferred to prisons inside Israel in violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. \n",
      "Most recently, Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) member Khalida Jarrar was arrested on April 2 and subsequently detained pursuant to an administrative detention order issued by an Israeli military commander in the West Bank on Sunday April 5. Jarrar remains in administrative detention in a prison in Israel. The order is currently under review by the Ofer Military Court in the West Bank. If confirmed, Jarrar would be subjected to six months detention, without charge or trial, renewable indefinitely.\n",
      "This is not the first time Jarrar has been subject to administrative orders by the Israeli military commander in the West Bank. On 20 August 2014, Jarrar received a military order giving her 24 hours to move from Ramallah, where she lives, to the district of Jericho where her movements would be restricted for six months. On appeal, an Israeli court reduced the restriction to one month.\n",
      "The Israeli practice of administrative detention has been condemned on numerous occasions by the UN Human Rights Office and the Human Rights Committee that oversees implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Israel has ratified. However, as of February this year, there were reportedly 424 Palestinians held under administrative detention orders - more than double the 181 held at the same time last year.\n",

      "We are concerned by the deterioration of the security situation in Bangui since the recent visit of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, with at least 60 people killed since March 22.A series of clashes between anti-Balaka and Muslims have taken place in various neighbourhoods of the capital in the past week. On 27 March, at least 20 people were killed and 11 injured when a grenade was thrown at a crowd of mourners during a funeral service near the PK5 neighbourhood. On 22 and 23 March, anti-Balaka elements attacked the same neighbourhood, where some 700 Muslims are believed to be stranded, in an attempt to take control of the zone. According to the Red Cross, at least 15 people were killed during the subsequent fighting and the intervention of MISCA and the French Sangaris forces.Increased tensions and clashes between anti-Balaka elements and MISCA forces have also been reported, with anti-Balaka reportedly directly targeting MISCA military and civilian personnel on several occasions.\n",

      "GENEVA/SEOUL (8 May  2019) - The UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea has expressed hope that the UN's 'peer  review' process will persuade authorities in North Korea to change direction  and to prioritise improving the lives of ordinary citizens.\"This is a rare opportunity for States to directly  engage with the DPRK Government on human rights issues,' said Tomas Ojea  Quintana, referring to the Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review  (UPR) of the DPRK on 9 May in Geneva.\n",

Such a way of living is contrary to the fundamental right to live in  dignity, and should never be tolerated.\"Although the Government of the DPRK denies the  existence of the political prisons, information gathered indicates that  citizens of North Korea fear being sent to these prisons for any act perceived  critical of the authorities.\"I hope that the Government of the DPRK and reviewing  States put the ordinary North Korean's lives at the heart and openly discuss  how to improve their daily life,\" the UN expert said.ENDSMr. Tom\\xc3\\xa1s OJEA QUINTANA (Argentina) was designated as the Special  Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DPRK by the  UN Human Rights Council in 2016.

      "  \n",
      "Introducing the  report, Mohamed Lemine Ould Sidi, Commissioner for Human Rights, Humanitarian  Action and Relations with Civil Society of Mauritania, explained that in order  to give effect to the Convention against Torture, Mauritania had adopted  several laws, including a law on the fight against torture (law no. 2015-033),  which incorporated the definition of torture as contained in the Convention,  prohibited secret detention, and stipulated the necessary measures to ensure  the impartial and independent investigation of all cases of torture.  In  addition, the law no. 2015-034 provided for the creation of the National  Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, which had been set up on 20 April  2016.  The Mechanism was an independent institution that was granted all  the necessary financial and human resources in line with the provisions of the  Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  In addition,  Mauritania had adopted laws to prohibit the corporal punishment of children and  female genital mutilation, as well as a road map to eradicate contemporary  forms of slavery.\n",

      "In the ensuing  discussion, Committee Experts commended Mauritania for having adopted the laws  on the fight against torture, established the National Mechanism for the  Prevention of Torture, criminalized slavery, and ensured the provision of legal  aid.  However, they raised concern about lengthy pre-trial detention,  especially in relation to anti-terrorism legislation, poor maintenance of  prison and detention registers, lack of a guarantee for access to a lawyer  throughout the legal process, the existence of secret detention facilities,  absence of systematic separation of prisoners according to sex and age, and the  use of excessive force against prisoners and of solitary confinement.   Other issues raised concerned the expulsion of foreigners, lack of a  disaggregated database on prosecutions and sentences arising from acts of torture  and ill-treatment, prison overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions in prisons,  the application of Sharia-mandated (hadd and qisas) penalties,  such as amputation and whipping, the payment of the so-called blood money (diyah)  to the families of victims, training programmes for police officers and  judicial personnel, availability of reparations for victims, and amnesty for  past crimes.   \n",

      "\n",
      "Jens Modvig,  Committee Chairperson, reminded the delegation that it could submit additional  replies in writing within 48 hours.  He thanked all members of civil  society from Mauritania for their participation in the dialogue with Committee,  and he asked the State party and civil society to respect each other's role in  the dialogue with the Committee.    \n",

      "MOHAMED LEMINE  OULD SIDI, Commissioner for Human Rights, Humanitarian Action and Relations  with Civil Society of Mauritania, said that the report had been drafted in  a participatory manner, in consultation with all the ministries, national human  rights institutions, and civil society.  He reiterated Mauritania's  commitment to the mandate of the Committee against Torture, and he presented  key developments in the country since the presentation of its initial report.   The Government of Mauritania placed great emphasis on the promotion and  protection of human rights, which was at the heart of its policies.   Reminding that Mauritania had ratified the Convention against Torture in  2004, the Commissioner noted that his country's commitment to the Convention  had been strengthened by the ratification of the following human rights  instruments: the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, the Convention on  the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,  the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,  the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the Convention  No. 29 on forced labour of the International Labour Organization.  In  order to give effect to the Convention against Torture, Mauritania had adopted  several laws to criminalize torture and slavery.  In September 2015, it  adopted a law on the fight against torture (law no. 2015-033), which  incorporated the definition of torture as contained in the Convention,  prohibited secret detention, and stipulated the necessary measures to ensure an  impartial and independent investigation of all cases of torture.  In  addition, the law no. 2015-034 provided for the creation of the National  Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, which had been set up on 20 April  2016.  The Mechanism was an independent institution that was granted with  all the necessary financial and human resources in line with the provisions of  the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The adoption of  the law no. 2017-016 in July 2017 regulated the composition, organization and  functioning of the National Commission for Human Rights, and it strengthened  its independence, professionalism and the pluralism of its members.  In  addition, Mauritania had adopted laws to prohibit the corporal punishment of  children and female genital mutilation, as well as a road map to eradicate  contemporary forms of slavery.  The authorities had conducted public  awareness raising campaigns to delegitimize slavery in all its forms, and they  had worked with religious leaders and civil society to that end.  Turning  to female genital mutilation, the Commissioner noted that the Government had  achieved significant results in recent years in reducing the prevalence of  female genital mutilation among girls, which had decreased from 66.6 per cent  in 2011 to 53.2 per cent in 2015.  As for the improvement of prison  conditions, the Commissioner underlined that the rate of overcrowding had  decreased since 2016, adding that the length of judicial proceedings had  shortened.  The authorities were currently constructing new detention  units, and were working to ensure the separation of prisoners and to improve  their access to social and educational activities.    \n",

      "Questions  by the Country Rapporteurs\n",
      "\n",
      "SEBASTIEN  TOUZ\\xc3\\x89, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, commended the  adoption of the law no. 2015-033 on the fight against torture, the law  establishing the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, as well as  the laws criminalizing slavery, establishing the National Commission for Human  Rights, and the law on legal aid.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to pre-trial  detention, Mr. Touze noted that the Criminal Procedure Code contained  several provisions which were not in line with international human rights  instruments.  Very often people were held in pre-trial detention beyond 48  hours, and it seemed that many problems with respect to pre-trial detention  arose from the implementation of anti-terrorism legislation.  The  2010 Anti-Terrorism Law contained an imprecise definition of terrorism, which  aimed to suppress the \"undermining of the fundamental social values and  destabilization of constitutional, political, economic and social institutions  of the Nation.\"  What was meant by the \"undermining of the fundamental  social values\"?  Had the audit of anti-terrorism legislation by the United  Nations led to any recommendations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Prison and  detention registers were  very badly kept, Mr. Touze underlined.  Some of those registers had been  filled after the fact, which was particularly worrying.  What improvements  had been made with respect to the recommendations that those registers be  enhanced?  Did the State party intend to digitize them and make them  available to civil society?  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the rights  of detained persons, Mr. Touze inquired about how charges were communicated  to persons deprived of their liberty, and about their access to a lawyer from  the moment of arrest.  In cases of terrorism and acts against the State,  the national law did not guarantee access to a lawyer throughout the legal  process, Mr. Touze reminded and added that the law against torture was,  therefore, applied very selectively and arbitrarily.  He also raised a  concern that there were not enough lawyers to provide aid to the poorest  segments of the society.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Touze  further inquired about access to a medical doctor and asked whether  medical examinations took place without the presence of the police.   Turning to incommunicado detention for acts of terrorism, he  inquired whether the State party had opened any inquiries into secret places of  detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to detention conditions, the Country Co-Rapporteur reminded that the  majority of prisoners were accommodated in places which were not tailored for  such purposes.  A number of detention centres were improvised and did not  have efficient oversight, leading to severe overcrowding.  Hygiene  conditions were deplorable and sometimes prisoners did not have any place to  sit or lie down.  What measures had the State party undertaken to remedy  the problem of overcrowding?  Would the planned construction of new prison  units remedy the problem?  He wondered whether the penal policy itself was  the cause of overcrowding?  What was the number of prisoners,  disaggregated by sex, age and nationality?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sentenced  prisoners and those in pre-trial detention were frequently kept together.   Why was it that the separation of minors from adult prisoners  was guaranteed in all places of detention, except those for women?  What  was the number of appropriately trained prison staff?  Could the  delegation comment on the use of excessive force against prisoners and  of solitary confinement?  Were there any ways to appeal those  disciplinary measures?  \n",
      "    \n",
      "Mr. Touze also  inquired about the provision of proper food and drinking water, and the lack of  medicines and trained medical staff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Noting the long  length of preventive detention, Mr. Touze stressed the need for the  overhaul of the judicial system and the use of alternative measures to  imprisonment. \n",
      "\n",
      "Had the State  party launched any inquiries into the use of excessive force by State agents  against demonstrators in January 2015, June 2016, and April 2017?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to  non-refoulement,  the Country Co-Rapporteur asked when the Government would adopt the bill on the  procedure to determine the status of refugees.  Was there an individual  appeal procedure in place for the expulsion of foreigners?  Could the  State party provide any information about fishing boats operating in  Mauritanian waters who were shot at?  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no  comprehensive disaggregated database on prosecutions and sentences arising from  acts of torture and ill-treatment.  Furthermore, there seemed to be a  general misunderstanding of the Istanbul Protocol among the medical staff.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the National  Commission for Human Rights, Mr. Touze asked about its accreditation and  independence from the executive branch.  What measures had the State party  adopted in order to ensure that the Commission could retain its A status in  line with the Paris Principles?  \n",
      "\n",
      "ESSADIA BELMIR, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, inquired about  Mauritania's criminal legislation and the fact that it appeared to be based on  the principle that the Sharia law took precedence over all other  legal provisions.  Ms. Belmir underlined the importance of evidence and  testimony, and of the principle of non-discrimination.  How could  individuals be sentenced to Sharia-mandated penalties (such as amputation and  whipping) when the actual definitions of infringements were vague?  That  was not in line with international standards. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Belmir  welcomed the training programmes on human rights provided to police  officers, judges and judicial personnel, and those responsible for the  protection of human rights.  However, there was a lack of specific  training on the Convention and its clear prohibition of the use of torture.   It seemed that the Istanbul Protocol was not applied systematically.   There was also a problem of holding judicial or interrogation procedures  in a language that was not mastered by all concerned persons.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to unofficial  detention centres, Ms. Belmir recalled that interrogations carried out  there were in flagrant violation of international human rights instruments.   Those suspected of terrorism were not guaranteed a lawyer and were often  forced into signing confessions.  There was also a problem of the lack of  sound and video recording of interrogations, and of intrusive physical searches  and examinations which were carried out by police officers instead of medical  professionals.          \n",
      "\n",
      "Members of the National  Guard were not sufficiently trained in running detention centres.   According to the information provided by civil society, some detainees had  died as a result.  The National Guard was often the first point of contact  for detainees which made it impossible for detainees to submit a complaint of  mistreatment.  The Government needed to ensure that those running prisons  and detention centres did so in a way that guaranteed the dignity of prisoners  and detainees.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The Special  Rapporteur on torture, who had visited Mauritania, had remarked that there was  a lack of adequate training for medical personnel working in detention centres.   There was only one forensic specialist in the entire country.  Some  persons were particularly vulnerable because there was no record of their  detention.  The Ministry of Justice should be doing more to tackle such  problems, which led to abuse and mistreatment.            \n",
      "      \n",
      "How many disciplinary  procedures had been initiated against members of law enforcement  forces for acts of torture?  The number of cases of torture prosecuted did  not correspond to the number of complaints.  Why were those complaints not  reaching the authorities?  There seemed to be reluctance of the judiciary  to order inquiries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to reparations and amnesty for past crimes, Ms. Belmir reminded of the lack of justice for  the alleged crimes of torture committed between 1989 and 1991.  In view of  the fact that the statute of limitation did not apply to crimes of torture,  were people really working to find out the truth?  Did the State party  generally consider that the issued pardons held water?  \n",
      "\n",
      "There were a  number of complaints of women being harassed or even raped when they complained  of being accused of adultery, which carried one of the harshest  penalties under Sharia.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Questions  by Committee Experts\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts raised  the issue of hadd penalties (amputation and  whipping), qisas penalties, and stoning for rape,  which were carried out under the Sharia law and were in complete conflict with  international standards.  Would such penalties be abolished?  Was the  moratorium on the death penalty effectively applied?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Experts  welcomed the adoption of a law that stipulated that any customary practice that  threatened the health, physical integrity and dignity of children would  be considered as degrading and inhumane treatment.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What was the  number of people that had benefitted from compensation for the  crimes of slavery and torture?   \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the  arrest and alleged abuse and torture of human rights defenders, Experts  inquired about the protection measures that the State party had in place to  address intimidation and reprisals against human rights defenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the independence  of the judiciary, Experts suggested that the role of the Supreme Court had  been decreased to dealing only with administrative issues.  What measures  had been taken to guarantee the independence of the judiciary?  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for gender-based  violence, Experts asked the State party to provide relevant statistics on  such offences.  Furthermore, Experts inquired about a Saudi Arabian agency  that in 2016 had recruited Mauritanian women for domestic work and then had  trafficked them for prostitution.  Did the State party license such  agencies and did it provide reparation to those trafficked women?\n",
      "\n",
      "Experts  underlined that compensation to victims of torture and ill-treatment had  to be implemented in practice.  They also asked for disaggregated  statistics on the compensation granted by the State.  \n",
      "\n",
      "How well was  the 2015 law on the fight against torture disseminated in the public?   What was the effectiveness of the National Mechanism for the  Prevention of Torture?  It seemed that it was \"deaf and blind\" to the  complaints of victims of torture and the protests of detainees seeking better  detention conditions.  National non-governmental organizations should be  authorized to carry out unannounced visits to places of detention.              \n",
      "\n",
      "Follow-up  Questions by Country Rapporteurs\n",
      "\n",
      "SEBASTIEN  TOUZ\\xc3\\x89, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, raised the  issue of confessions extracted under duress, and of the independence of  the National Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture.  He asked if civil  society organizations participated in the selection of the members of the  Mechanism, and about the dependence of the Mechanism members on salaries  provided by the Government.      \n",
      "   \n",
      "ESSADIA BELMIR, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, inquired about the right  to appeal by detained asylum seekers or foreigners.  It often seemed  that they were detained on no legal basis whatsoever.  The State party had  to ensure that persons were not returned to places where they could be at risk  of torture or ill-treatment, Ms. Belmir reminded.    \n",
      "  \n",
      "Replies  by the Delegation\n",
      "\n",
      "The delegation  explained that police custody could last up to 48 hours, excluding  public holidays and days of rest.  It could be extended once for the same  amount of time.  Access to a lawyer was foreseen from the very outset of  the arrest.  The appointment of an ex officio lawyer was mandatory if the  suspect was ill, with disability, or a minor.  There had not been any  cases of abuse or extension of police custody.  Detainees could contact  the person of their choice, and they were always brought before a medical  doctor in case of any signs of injury or abuse.  Prosecutors and judges  had to inform suspects of the charges against them and of the circumstances  under which the offence had been committed.  If suspects did not  understand Arabic, they received interpretation services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Police  presence during medical examination of suspects was not systematic; it took  place when dangerous persons were being examined.  Married prisoners could  receive private conjugal visits.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors  monitored police custody registers, which were kept up to date by the  police or prison authorities.  The Government was currently working to  digitalize custody registers.  Prisoners could be handcuffed during  transfers.  Transfers between prisons were always undertaken in dignified  conditions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the ambiguous  definition of terrorism, the bill that modified the Counter-Terrorism Law  was currently under review.  Police custody for terrorism charges could  last up to 15 days and was usually not renewed.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In June 2017,  72 persons had received lessened sentences.  A total of 204 persons had  received such reduced sentences.  Minors were only held in two prisons in  the country, and there was a separate prison facility for women in the capital  city of Nouakchott.  Separation was not always possible due to the lack of  facilities.  The authorities were currently building three new prisons.   As for hygienic conditions, there had been refurbishment carried  out in some detention centres.  The National Programme for Fighting  Tuberculosis catered for prisoners suffering from that disease.  In  addition, medical personnel had received training and awareness raising  programmes to deal with prisoners with HIV/AIDS.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no  prisoner in Mauritania that had been deprived of drinking water and  electricity, the delegation stressed.  Nevertheless, due to water wasting  in the central prison in Nouakchott, water rationing had been introduced.   As for the supply of medicines, a special budget line was devoted  to that.  All prisoners received breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Detainees could follow literacy programmes in detention centres that had  conditions for such activities. \n",
      "\n",
      "The use of solitary  confinement was determined by the prison warden and could be imposed  for 15 days for a maximum of 24 hours a day.  That measure was then  assessed by judges.  Prisoners with special medical needs were taken to  external clinics.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Pre-trial  detention was  a measure of last resort and could last up to four months for serious offences.   Judges could only impose it in line with the Code of Criminal Procedures.   There were non-custodial sentences available.  In order to reduce prison  overcrowding, the authorities had transferred some prisoners from  Nouakchott.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the refoulement  decisions, the delegation explained that it took place when all other legal  recourses had been exhausted.  Such decisions could be appealed in front  of administrative courts.    \n",
      "\n",
      "The judicial  authority was independent from the executive branch.  Judges were  protected from all forms of pressure that could undermine their authority.   Magistrates had legal authority as dictated by the law.  They could  not be replaced, unless due to disciplinary proceedings, or due to personal  request.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Confessions  extracted under duress were not valid.  There was no contradiction  between the Sharia law and the principle of evidence gathering.  Under the  national Constitution, Sharia remained the only source of law.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Inmates had  free access to judges, who could talk to them freely at any time.   They could also at any time submit complaints to judicial bodies.   There were no inmates in prisons without official detention papers.   Bodily searches could only be conducted by prison guards of the same  gender.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Eight members  of the National Guard had been handed down prison sentences for torture.   There had been no hunger strikes in prisons due to poor detention  conditions.  Non-government organizations could receive a permission to  visit places of detention from the Ministry of Justice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no secret  places of detention in Mauritania, and there was a very strict legal  framework governing that matter.  All places of detention were governed by  the Ministry of Justice.  Officers of judicial police were strictly  monitored and under direct control of the Prosecutor's Office.  No  interrogations or hearings could be held outside the judicial system.   Detention places were visited frequently by relevant monitoring  authorities and non-governmental organizations.  The authorities had not  received any complaints about criminal judicial procedures.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Training for  police officers was  based on the principles of human rights, including the entire set of  international human rights treaties.  Mauritania had ratified almost all  international human rights conventions.  All police officers had been  trained on criminal justice proceedings.  \n",
      "\n",
      "An administrative  detention centre had been created for foreigners who had been found in  violation of immigration laws.  There was a transit centre at the coastal  city of Nouadhibou for foreigners who wanted to reach the Canary Islands and  Europe.  Mauritania and Spain had signed an agreement to monitor their sea  borders.  There was a difference between the right to settlement and the  right to movement.  When citizens of Mali and Senegal came to Mauritania,  they had 19 days to obtain a residence permit.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the management  of demonstrations, the delegation noted that the authorities had managed to  strike a balance between freedom of expression and the maintenance of public  order.  The police force had been modernized and it had received some good  training.  In 2016, several police officers had been injured by hostile  demonstrators, who had vandalized public property and had set police vehicles  on fire.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to  the case of Senator Mohamed Ould Ghadda, the delegation underlined that  he had never been arbitrarily detained.  He had been placed under house  arrest in August 2017 on charges of corruption.  House arrest could last  up to 48 hours and could be renewed three times.  The period of house  arrest did not include public holidays and rest days.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to asylum  seekers, the delegation noted that they received regular support from the  authorities, civil society and the Red Cross.  There were currently more  than 16,000 asylum seekers, mostly from West Africa.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In 2017, the  Government had adopted an act to repeal the 2010 act regulating the functioning  of the National Commission for Human Rights, in line with the Paris  Principles.  The Commission was independent and it had budgetary autonomy.   There were 14 members of the Commission, coming from the national  administration and civil society.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the National  Mechanism for the Prevention of Torture, it comprised 24 experts from civil  society, professional associations, and the Government.  Candidates must  declare that if elected they would resign any other positions.  The  Mechanism had an annual budget which was separate from the State budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Acts of  violence against women were punished under the Penal Code.  Victims  of such violence received rehabilitation services and civil reparations.   The authorities had organized a number of public awareness campaigns to  encourage women victims of rape to report such crimes.  The Government was  currently reviewing a draft framework law on violence against women.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Questions  by the Country Rapporteurs\n",
      "\n",
      "SEBASTIEN  TOUZ\\xc3\\x89, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, reminded that  the Mauritanian authorities had prevented five persons from attending the  Committee's assessment of the State party's periodic report in Geneva.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Touze noted  that on a number of occasions the delegation had provided legalistic answers.   The problem, however, was not the law but its practical implementation.   The presence of a lawyer, for example, was not guaranteed due to  the shortage of lawyers.  Another example was the planned improvement of monitoring  and control of police custody registers.  Mr. Touze suggested that the  control of those registers be given to civil society.  \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition,  the Co-Rapporteur observed that the way the delegation described detention  conditions in Mauritania made him want to book a prison cell for  himself.  He noted that those descriptions did not correspond to reality.   Furthermore, the State party needed to provide specific documentary  evidence that there were no secret detention places.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Touze  expressed surprise that when the delegation described how the police had  questioned a drug smuggler, it said that he had been questioned at home and  that he had died during the interrogation due to a heart attack.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Touze  further questioned the appointment procedure for members of the  National Commission for Human Rights, and of the National Mechanism for the  Prevention of Torture, which raised concerns about their professionalism.      \n",
      "\n",
      "ESSADIA BELMIR, Committee Expert and Co-Rapporteur for Mauritania, raised the issue of  the payment of the so-called \"blood money\" (diyah), requested by the  family of victims.  Such an approach should be re-evaluated for those  already in the criminal justice system because they could not be left to depend  on the good will of the family of victims.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to foreigners  in Mauritania, Ms. Belmir commended the State party for having started  working on an asylum procedure.  \n",

      "\n",
      "The United  Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention had called on Mauritania to  provide victims of torture and ill-treatment with rehabilitation, Ms. Belmir  reminded.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Questions  by Committee Experts\n",
      "\n",
      "The Committee  Experts reiterated questions about corporal punishment, noting that  punishments which were not permissible under international law could not be  accepted by the Committee either.  Many Muslim countries had banned  corporal punishment, which showed that there could be different interpretations  of the Sharia law.  Jurisprudence of the Committee and other treaty bodies  should lead Mauritania to abolish corporal punishment.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Experts also  reiterated the question about dual sentencing under the criminal  justice system and the Sharia law.  Had there been any developments with  respect to scientific and technical police investigations?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to the past  human rights violations committed between 1989 and 1991 (Passif  humanitaire), the Committee Experts wondered whether victims of torture  received rehabilitation and support.  They also reiterated their questions  about the guidelines for courts to order the payment of reparations.     \n",
      "\n",
      "JENS MODVIG, Committee  Chairperson, reacting to a statement by one of the members of the  delegation, asked who were suspects that \"required to be tortured.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Replies  by the Delegation\n",
      "\n",
      "A member of the  delegation explained that he was misunderstood when he had said that there had  been no need to \"torture\" the drug smuggler.  All the evidence had been  found with him.  There was no need to torture any suspect.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Turning to alleged  secret places of detention, the delegation denied that there were any  secret basements in police stations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "People from  Senegal and Mali could obtain legal residency in Mauritania through regular  channels, but not when they tried to enter the country illegally.  Those  who entered the country illegally were subject to refoulement.      \n",
      "\n",
      "The justice  system had to be modernized and the police force had to become more scientific  and technological.  The same applied to custody and police registers.   The authorities were taking major steps forward despite the lack of  resources.               \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the five  persons from Mauritania who had not been able to attend the review of the State  party's report in front of the Committee, the delegation clarified that their  visas had been found to be invalid.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With respect to detention conditions, the delegation noted that they were not ideal, but  that they had improved considerably.  The data provided by the delegation  could be verified.  Turning to the issue of overcrowding, each year  prisoners from Nouakchott were transferred to other prisons.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the \"blood  money\" (diyah), the sentence could be lessened even in the absence of the  pardon by the family of victims and the State could take on itself to pay the  \"blood money.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "MOHAMED LEMINE  OULD SIDI, Commissioner for Human Rights, Humanitarian Action and Relations  with Civil Society of Mauritania, reiterated the will of his Government to  progress in the fight against torture.  Mauritania fully cooperated with  all bodies and mechanisms in the area of human rights.  Mr. Ould Sidi  thanked all members of the Committee for the quality of their comments and  questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "JENS MODVIG, Committee  Chairperson, reminded the delegation that it could submit additional  replies in writing within 48 hours.  He thanked all members of civil  society from Mauritania for their participation in the dialogue with the  Committee, and he asked the State party and civil society to respect each  other's role in the dialogue with the Committee.__________ For use of the information media; not an  official record\n",

      "GENEVA (6 November 2014) - Two United Nations human rights experts today urged the Government of Bangladesh to stay the execution of Muhammad Kamaruzzaman, leader of the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party, condemned to death for crimes against humanity.\n",
      "The UN Special Rapporteurs on summary executions, Christof Heyns, and on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, expressed serious concern at reports that Mr. Kamaruzzaman could be executed as early as Thursday 6 November 2014 at midnight. \n",
      "Earlier this week, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court confirmed Mr. Kamaruzzaman's sentence to death handed down by the Bangladesh International Crimes Tribunal on 9 May 2013. \n",
      "The International Crimes Tribunal is a special domestic court with the jurisdiction to try and punish any person accused of committing atrocities, including genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, in Bangladesh, including during the country's 1971 independence war.\n",
      "The UN human rights experts have on several occasions expressed alarm regarding serious violations of fair trial and due process guarantees in the judicial proceedings before the Tribunal that were reported to them. \n",
      "\"In countries that have not abolished the death penalty, capital punishment may be imposed only following a trial that complied with the most stringent guarantees of fair trial and due process,\" the experts noted. \"Any death sentence executed in contravention of a Government's international obligations is tantamount to an arbitrary execution.\"\n",
      "\"A person sentenced to death must also have the right to seek pardon or commutation of his sentence,\" Mr. Heyns and Ms. Knaul stressed.\n",

      "\\xe2\\x80\\x8bSpanishGENEVA/WASHINGTON  (24 April 2018) - Two human rights experts are calling on the authorities in  Mexico to ensure a proposed law on government advertising establishes effective  safeguards for media independence and freedom of expression.\"Government  officials in Mexico spend billions of pesos annually on advertising but the  lack of regulation poses a serious risk to media independence and infringes  upon the public's right to information,\" said Edison Lanza, Inter-American  Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression,  and David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the  right to freedom of opinion and expression.\"Mexico  has an obligation to establish laws regulating Government advertising with  clear rules regarding its objectives, allocation criteria and procedures in  order to curtail any discriminatory or arbitrary use of these funds,\" they  stressed.In  a landmark ruling on 15 November 2017, the Mexican Supreme Court ordered  Congress to develop regulations for government advertising before 30 April  2018, and the proposed legislation introduced to Congress seeks to comply with  that ruling. The Mexican Chamber of Deputies approved the measure on April 10  in a process that has been described as lacking meaningful consultation with  civil society and other interested parties. The draft is now being discussed in  the Senate, where lawmakers have demanded changes.In  their preliminary findings at the end of their joint official visit to Mexico  last December, the two experts welcomed the Supreme Court's ruling and urged  Mexico's Congress not only to adopt clear and public rules governing  advertising that ensure regular and specific reporting, but also to develop a  plan to progressively limit such expenditure altogether, in consultation with  civil society and relevant experts.In  their latest statement, the experts said: \"We are concerned the proposed law  continues to leave a wide margin of discretion to government officials to  establish criteria for the allocation and use of Government funds for  advertising.\" The  experts stressed: \"Pre-established criteria with clear government obligations  to explain the legal grounds and reasons behind decisions regarding allocation  of advertising funds is essential to prevent abuse and excessive spending.\"The  law should clearly prohibit the use of government advertising for electoral or  partisan purposes or to infringe upon media freedom and establish mechanisms  for external oversight by an autonomous body,\" they said. \"The  lack of an effective system of accountability for failure to comply with the  law is a concern. The law should provide for accountability procedures, backed  by penalties and appropriate remedies,\" the experts emphasized.\"We  welcome the new discussions in the Senate and call on lawmakers to carry out a  thorough reassessment of the proposed legislation, with meaningful  consultations for civil society and others, to ensure the new law complies  with international human rights standards,\" they said.ENDS \n",

      "GENEVA (11 February 2019) - The UN Special Rapporteur  on the independence of judges and lawyers, Diego Garcia-Say\\xc3\\xa1n, is warning that the  suspension and replacement of the Chief Justice of Nigeria by the country's  President is in contravention of international human rights standards on  independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. \"International human rights standards provide that  judges may be dismissed only on serious grounds of misconduct or incompetence.  Any decision to suspend or remove a judge from office should be fair and should  be taken by an independent authority such as a judicial council or a court,\"  said the UN human rights expert. \"The dismissal of judges without following procedures  laid down by the law and without effective judicial protection being available  to contest the dismissal is incompatible with the independence of the  judiciary,\" the UN expert warned.  Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen was suspended on 25  January 2019 and replaced by Ibrahim Tanko Mohammad. The President of Nigeria said he had acted in  compliance with an order issued two days earlier by a tribunal established  under the Constitution to decide on alleged breaches of the Code of Conduct for  Public Officials. However, four separate Nigerian courts - the Court of Appeal,  the National Industrial Court and the two Federal High Courts - had already  ordered a stay of proceedings in the Tribunal. Moreover, the said order upon  which the suspension was based, was issued ex-parte while the motion on notice  on the same subject was adjourned the day before by the issuing court. \"All State institutions must abide by the decisions of  national courts and tribunals. In the case of Chief Justice Onnoghen, four  national courts hierarchically superior to the Code of Conduct Tribunal had  already ordered a stay of proceedings, and the Tribunal had in a previous case,  8 months earlier, held that it lacked jurisdiction over cases involving  judicial officers, which should be processed by the National Judicial Council,\"  the UN expert stressed.  Some of the judges handling the case of the Chief  Justice and the defence lawyers have been subject to serious threats, pressures  and interferences. \"I am seriously concerned at such allegations, which may  constitute, if proven, grave attacks to the independence of the judiciary and  the free exercise of the legal profession,\" said the expert. \"One of the senior advocates defending the Chief  Justice was arrested on Wednesday by security agencies. Lawyers play an  essential role in securing access to justice, and should never suffer, or be  threatened with, prosecution or other sanctions for action taken in accordance  with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics,\" added Mr.  Garc\\xc3\\xada-Say\\xc3\\xa1n. The UN expert has expressed his concerns to the  Nigerian Government and will continue to follow events. ENDS Mr. Diego Garc\\xc3\\xada-Say\\xc3\\xa1n (Peru) was  appointed UN Special Rapporteur on the  independence of judges and lawyers in December 2016. Mr. Garc\\xc3\\xada-Say\\xc3\\xa1n was formerly a judge of the  Inter-American Court of Human Rights for two consecutive terms. During his  tenure, he was elected Vice-President of the Court (2008-2009) and President of  the Court for two consecutive terms (2009-2013). He has long-standing  experience working on human rights issues in a variety of settings, including  for the United Nations and the Organization of American States. The Special Rapporteurs are part of what is known as the Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council.

      "   Experts welcome the  intention to establish a national human rights institution compliant with the  Paris Principles and raise concern about discrimination and violence on the  grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity \n",
      "    The Human Rights Committee concluded today its review of the  implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in  Dominica, in the absence of a report and with the delegation present.  The  Experts discussed, among other issues, the frequent use of the state of  emergency, the use of force against the opposition and the potential abuses  present in the wording and implementation of the Public Order Act, infringing  on the freedom of assembly.   \n",
      "    Committee Experts  welcomed Dominica's participation in the dialogue and its frank and open  contributions, which signalled the recognition of the value of the engagement  with the Committee.  Noting a 27-years delay in submitting a report,  Experts recognized the difficulties this small country faced in fulfilling its  reporting obligation under the Covenant and welcomed the intention to establish  a national human rights institution that complied with the Paris Principles.During the dialogue, the Committee Experts flagged a wide variety of  reasons that provided a legal justification to institute a state of emergency,  proclaimed 20 times over the last 20 years, and the related limitations on  rights protected under the Covenant.The 2018  Anti-Terrorism Act contained a very broad definition of terrorism and there was  concern that it might be used as a tool to intimidate political  opposition.  The excessive use of force against the opposition, combined  with the police raids on opposition villages and political meetings indicated a  broader pattern.  The wording and implementation of the Public Order  Act possibly infringed on the freedom of assembly, as it was being used to  disperse opposition's meetings.The Experts were  concerned about the violence, harassment and marginalization of lesbian, gay,  bisexual, transgender and intersex persons and by the so-called \"gay panic\"  criminal defence that justified murder if the male victim propositioned the  accused.  Furthermore, consensual same-sex sexual activity was  criminalized and the convicted persons could be detained in psychiatric  hospitals for court-ordered treatment.Vince Henderson,  Ambassador of Dominica to the United States of America and its Permanent  Representative to the Organisation of American States, in his introductory  remarks appreciated the important work of the Committee and reiterated his  country's commitment to its human rights obligations.  He said that the  Constitution guaranteed every person in Dominica the fundamental rights and  freedoms without discrimination but subject to the rights and freedoms of  others and for the public interest.  Dominica was a  country that operated under the rule of law and that had strong democratic  institutions for the administration of justice, but further progress was  hampered by resource constraints and the impact of disasters, he said.   The tropical storm Erika in 2015 and hurricane Maria in 2017 had dealt  devastating blows to all sectors of the economy, with damages estimated at 90  percent and 226 percent of gross domestic product, respectively.The delegation explained that the agreement of a majority in Parliament  was required to declare a state of emergency, mostly done when the country was  faced with hurricanes and storms ; guarantees existed to protect individuals in  such situations. The death penalty,  abortion and same-sex issues were part of a broader contingent of issues that  required a public conversation and citizenship participation ; the Government  could not change laws on large social issue by fiat.  The law criminalizing consensual same-sex activity was not enforced and  over the past five years, there had been no records of attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons.   Equally, they did not face institutional discrimination. Stressing the peace-loving character of the nation and the long history  of peaceful political transition, the delegation said that the Prime Minister,  accompanied by the representatives of the Caribbean Community, was heading to  Guyana to meet with the two sides that had been in the standoff since the  conclusion of the elections on 2 March.  In the run-up to the  December 2019 elections, the opposition parties continued to use the tools from  their playbook: threats, intimidation, disruption and propaganda war, which  they seemed to be winning as international media reported on a \"massive  demonstrations and civil unrest involving thousands of people\", even though  only several hundred people had demonstrated.  Objecting to the  reports and publications cited by the Experts, some of which were \"frivolous in  their claims\", the delegation said that Dominica did not appear before the  Committee to \"defend the indefensible nor to burry its head in the sand\".   It appeared before the Committee to respond to questions on obligations it had  voluntarily accepted, even if it had concerns about the Committee's sources.The regulations on  the use of force were consistent with international standards and the  Constitution.  Police officers had been brought to courts for the use of  excessive force, and there was an internal mechanism within the police force to  deal with the issue.  The Public Order Act regulated  public processions or gatherings that could disrupt the daily activities of the  public ; therefore the police had acted within their rights in breaking up the  public meetings of the opposition.  The standards for the use of force to protect  the property were determined by the judiciary and the legislature, and not by  the executive, stressed the delegation. The delegation of Dominica consisted of the representatives of the  Embassy of Dominica to the United States of America and its Permanent Mission  to the Organisation  of American States.The Committee will issue the concluding observations on the report of  Dominica at the end of its one hundred and twenty-eighth session on 27  March.  Those, and other documents relating to the Committee's work,  including reports submitted by States parties, can be found on the \n",

      "   Opening Statement \n",
      "    VINCE HENDERSON, Ambassador  of Dominica to the United States of America and its Permanent Representative to  the Organisation of American States, in his introductory remarks, expressed  appreciation for the important work of the Committee towards the achievement of  universal human rights and reiterated his country's commitment to its human  rights obligations.  Dominica took seriously its obligations under the  Covenant, Mr. Henderson said.  The Constitution guaranteed every person in  Dominica the fundamental rights and freedoms without discrimination but subject  to the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest.  It  clearly outlined those rights and freedoms, which included the right to life,  liberty, security of the person and the protection of the law, freedom of  conscience and association, protection of the privacy of the home, and others.Dominica was founded  upon the principles that acknowledged the supremacy of God, faith in  fundamental human rights and freedoms, the position of the family in the  society of free men and women and free institutions, the dignity of the human  person and the equal and inalienable rights with which all members of the human  family were endowed by the creator.  Since its  independence in 1978, Dominica had been working towards the attainment of a  truly independent and democratic society, based on the principles of equality  and social justice for all.  Notwithstanding the many challenges, it had  made tremendous strides towards its goals ; today, it was a country that  operated under the rule of law and had strong democratic institutions for the  administration of justice.Recognizing the areas  in which the administration of justice could be improved, Mr. Henderson noted the  debilitating impact of resource constraints on the creation of institutions for  the protection of rights and freedoms.  Nevertheless, Dominica remained  committed to creating a more just society based on a rule of law and would  continue to make the necessary investments within the limits of its resources  and with the assistance of international partners.The constraints of  resources had been continuously exacerbated by natural and manmade disasters,  although nowadays it was hard to say which disasters were natural and which  were manmade, since the impact of climate change was so real.  Hurricane  David in 1979 had devastated the agricultural sector and the housing stock of  Dominica.  The tropical storm Erika in 2015 and hurricane Maria in 2017  had dealt devastating blows to all sectors of the economy, causing the damages  estimated at 90 percent and 226 percent of gross domestic product,  respectively.Dominica was learning  to live and cope with what had become a new normal, created by unsustainable  systems of production and consumption by other countries.  It continued to  make the case that Dominica was not a cause of climate change but a victim  along with other Small Islands Developing States throughout the Caribbean, the  Pacific and the Indian Ocean.  The action by the international community  and a new form of international justice were required.The international  economic and trading system continued to place Small Islands Developing States  at a disadvantage.  The Dominican banana industry, previously a mainstay  of the economy, had been decimated after it had lost preferential treatment  status at the World Trade Organization two decades ago.  In addition,  Dominica's efforts to diversify its economy by providing offshore financial  services was greeted with the same hostility, this time by the Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development, at the same time it had protected its  own financial sectors and its overseas territories.  Dominica was today  facing a new challenge in the financial sector because of the United States  regulations, which restricted its ability to trade.  Dominica remained  committed to fighting corruption, money laundering and terrorism but it also  reaffirmed its right to develop.  The international community must  recognize that those actions converged to a point where they affected that  right and the fundamental rights of all people, said Mr. Henderson.  The  largest revenue earner for Dominica was its Citizenship by Investment  Programme, supported by due diligence carried out by external companies and  subject to scrutiny by the Director of Audit.  Any effort to undermine  this programme would undermine the country's pursuit of its Sustainable  Development Goals and the administration of justice, and consequently the  rights and freedoms of its people.   \n",
      "    In 2019, Dominica had  successfully completed the Universal Periodic Review process during which it  had received 140 recommendations, of which it had accepted 86.   Significant progress had been made in implementing them, for example, it had  created a national mechanism for the implementation, reporting and follow up  and was drafting an action plan to guide the implementation of recommendations. \n",
      "    \n",
      "   Questions by the Committee Experts \n",
      "    Committee Experts welcomed the delegation and said that its appearance  signalled the recognition of the value of the engagement with the  Committee.  Acknowledging the  difficulties a small country like Dominica faced in fulfilling its legal  obligation to report to the Committee, the Experts regretted that the report  of Dominica, which had ratified the Covenant 27 years ago, had reached the  Committee only a few hours before the start of the constructive dialogue.   They emphasized the importance and value of timely State party reporting,  noting that it was an occasion to reflect, take stock and remedy the  implementation of the Covenant, especially when civil society was robustly  involved in the development of the report.  Reporting was not just a  formality, but also an opportunity for the State party to signal to the  international community that it was serious about its international  commitments.The Constitution of  Dominica prevailed over any other law and included many rights protected under  the Covenant ; however, many rights in the Constitution were subject to  exceptions.  What was the status of the Covenant under the domestic law and what was the timeline for the ratification of the two Optional  Protocols?  Experts also asked whether the Covenant would be incorporated  into the domestic law by an act of Parliament to make it enforceable in  domestic courts.  The Constitution of  Dominica allowed for the limitation of rights to ensure that the enjoyment of  rights and freedoms did not prejudice the rights and freedoms of others or the  public interest.  The delegation was asked to explain how the \"public  interest\" was defined and how limiting of rights complied with the Covenant,  which made no such reference.The Constitution  provided for the position of Parliamentary Commissioner to investigate  complaints made against the Government, but this position had never been  filled.  Experts welcomed the intention of Dominica to establish a national  human rights institution that complied with the Paris Principles.The 1998 Sexual  Offences Act criminalized consensual same-sex sexual activity with a  penalty of up to 25 years imprisonment and allowed courts to order detention of  persons convicted under the Act in psychiatric hospitals for treatment.   During the 2014 Universal Periodic Review, Dominica had indicated it was not prepared  to decriminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity.  Had this position  changed?  The Committee was alarmed by reports of violence, harassment and  marginalization of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons,  including by the police and asked what was being done to make them feel safe.The so-called \"gay  panic\" criminal defence was a source of concern as it justified a murder if  a male victim propositioned the accused.  How did Dominica ensure that the  sexual orientation of the victim was not a justification for violent crimes in  the future?The Constitution  prescribed a variety of possible cases in which a state of emergency could be proclaimed, including a danger posed by an individual.  Dominica  had proclaimed the state of emergency 20 times over the past 20 years.   The Experts inquired about the guarantees in place to ensure that the state of  emergency was only proclaimed when the life of the nation was threatened, as  prescribed by the Covenant, that the limitations to the rights under the  Covenant were justifiable and limited in scope and duration and that  non-derrogable rights were protected.  The 2018  Anti-Terrorism Act contained a very broad definition of terrorism, which  was also inconsistent throughout the text.  There was a concern among the  politicians in Dominica that the anti-terrorism legislation might be used as a  tool to intimidate political opposition.The death penalty was mandatory for crimes such as aggravated murder ; its mandatory nature was  contrary to the Covenant.  Given the \n",
      "   de facto moratorium on the  death penalty would Dominica align its legislation accordingly and ratify the  Second Optional Protocol abolishing the death penalty?Committee Experts  sought information on prohibited grounds for discrimination in the law  and whether any measures were undertaken to combat discrimination of persons  with HIV/AIDS, sex workers, elderly persons and persons with disabilities.On gender equality,  the Experts asked the delegation to provide exact figures on female ministers  and the number of high-ranking positions occupied by women in the public and  private sectors.  The Bureau of Gender Affairs, the main body dealing with  gender discrimination issues, reportedly lacked human and other resources to  address the issues under its purview.  In addition, it was unclear whether  the policy of equal wage for equal work for men and women had been  instituted.  Had any specific measures been taken to prevent violence against  women, including training to judicial and law officers, and how was rape  defined in the law?The delegation was  asked about the impact of climate change on agriculture and the steps  taken to tackle climate change and strengthen the resilience of the people.Child survival trends were in sharp  contrast to the rest of the world, indicating an inadequate health  system.  Medical termination of a pregnancy was permitted only when the  life of the mother was at risk and Experts called on the country to pass abortion legislation.  Most schools in Dominica did not have sex education in their  curriculum and teenage pregnancy was a significant issue.  \n",
      "   Replies by the  Delegation \n",
      "    The delegation began by emphasizing that Dominica was a small, fledgling  democracy and reminded the Committee about the resource constraints.  The  inter-ministerial committee appointed by the Cabinet was the first step on the  road towards more timely and accurate reporting.  The death penalty,  abortion and same-sex issues were part of a broader contingent of issues that  required a public conversation and citizenship participation ; the Government  could not change laws on large social issue by fiat.  With regard to the rights  enshrined in the Constitution, the delegation acknowledged that it was a  living document and that new issues and rights were being embraced in Dominica,  despite the legacy of colonialism.  The power to declare  a state of emergency had been used 20 times, mostly due to incoming  hurricanes.  The agreement of a majority in Parliament was required for  such a declaration.  Guarantees existed to protect individuals during the  state of emergency, such as provisions for compensation in case of destruction  of property for instance.  Unfortunately, the Parliamentary  Commissioner had never been appointed, but mechanisms that could be used in  its place existed in the law.  The presence of a national human rights  institution would have facilitated the work done for this session ; its  potential establishment was already discussed.Counter-terrorism issues were  important, and most of the legislation that was passed internally was already  made and prepared in advance as part of Dominica's role in combatting terrorism  internationally.  With regard to  Committee's questions related to discrimination and violence on the grounds  of sexual orientation and gender identity, delegation stated that there was  not much public discussion, similarly to the same-sex issue.  Over the  last five years, there had been no records of attacks.  The delegation  acknowledged the Human Rights Watch report on the issue and said that, while  Dominica was not perfect, there was no cause for concern.The delegation  stressed that there was no institutional discrimination against lesbian,  gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons in Dominica and the laws that  criminalized them were not enforced.  Stronger reporting institutions  within the police were needed.  The Government encouraged a move towards  greater tolerance in the society, especially towards those living with  HIV/AIDS.  The Bureau of  Gender Affairs had been created more than a decade ago, but its current  position was a reflection of the broader lack of resources in the  country.  Over the last two decades, girls outperformed boys in schools,  colleges and universities in Dominica, the fact that was also reflected in the  positions that women held in public and private sector.The passage of the  Domestic Violence Act gave women the opportunity to deal with the issue in a  way they had been unable to before.  A system was in place to provide  support to victims of violence against women.  The Government  provided free housing and free healthcare to female-headed households.  Family  life education was taught in most schools and the Planned Parenthood  Association continued to provide public information on sexual and reproductive  health.  Teenage mothers were provided with a variety of opportunities to  return to school.The Prime Minister  had recently initiated a public conversation on the right to life.  No  precise timeline was available, but work on formally banning the death  penalty was underway.  As for the rights of persons  with disabilities, a number of programs that helped students with  disabilities had been introduced.  While Dominica did not have a law  protecting persons with disabilities from discrimination, structural  discrimination was absent.  The Cabinet had instituted several programmes  in favour of the elderly, such as an allowance for those who did not  have a pension.Dominica had one of  the best healthcare records in the Caribbean and had recently started to  build smart health centres, alongside a new hospital that was under construction.   Infant mortality was an issue of serious concern to which the Government would  give adequate attention.  Healthcare received higher shares of the public  budget in recent years and more investments were being made.With regard to climate  change, the Government was reaching out within the framework of its climate  resilience program, for instance it provided investment to farmers to plant  more climate resilient crops and supplied equipment to fishermen.  In the  aftermath of the hurricane Maria, Dominica had recognized that resilience was  not only about infrastructure, but also about people.The delegation  reiterated that democracies must reflect the wishes of the people and that  social progress was more worthy than legislation that was disconnected from  those wishes.  They also noted that some civil society actors tended to  use inaccurate information.\n",
      "   Questions by the  Committee ExpertsCommittee Experts  stated that there were longstanding credible allegations regarding the use of excessive  force by the police.  They mentioned reports of a police raid on the  Salisbury village and a raid on a meeting of the political opposition as part  of a broader pattern.  Were there any guidelines regarding the use of  force in the police force, was there an independent oversight of police action  and how did it function?The Committee brought  up the section of the Constitution that allowed reasonably justifiable force  in the protection of property and asked whether the Government was willing  to repeal it.  Committee Experts  commended the Government's actions on child labour, especially the  increase in the number of labour inspectors, but the concern remained about the  continued use of child labour and the persistent commercial sexual exploitation  of children.The Committee sought  further elaborations on the general nature of the protections of the freedom  of expression in light of the limitations on the protection of reputation  and defamation of others.  More information on the license regime  regulating media and press was requested.  Experts also sought more  comments on the non-attendance of parliamentary hearings by journalists and any  potential work on the decriminalization of defamation.\n",
      "   Replies by the  DelegationThe delegation  stressed that the Dominican people were peace loving and that the rate of crime  was relatively low compared to other similar states.  The State was  characterised by political stability too and since attaining independence in  1979, all the transitions of power following the elections had been  peaceful.  The delegation noted  that some of Dominica's neighbours had difficulties in accepting the will of  the people expressed at the ballot box and had disintegrated into a major civil  arrest.  Therefore, it greatly appreciated the peacefulness of its people  even if the campaigns could be very heated, as was the case at the latest  elections.  The Prime Minister, accompanied by representatives of the  Caribbean Community, was heading to Guyana on this day, to meet with the two  sides that had been in the standoff since the conclusion of the elections on 2  March.  It was hoped that the situation would be resolved peacefully and  that the future Government would soon continue to work for the Dominican people.    As for the excessive  use of violence, the delegation said that the recent situations in  Dominica, especially in 2017 and 2019 were sad events in the country's  political history.  They had arisen from the actions of the opposition  parties, which were convinced that the only way to win an election was through  disruption, threats and violence.  They had also resorted to the use of  media to disseminate mistruths and had weaponized social media in their  propaganda war.  Sadly, some people and some non-governmental  organizations had used those unfounded allegations and falsehoods to fund the  opposition.  This could have serious implications in Dominica, which was  still struggling to find its way after two devastating storms, the delegation  stressed.The allegations that  the police had shot two men in Salisbury were untrue, as the police had not  used live rounds during the operation.  The regulations on the use of  force were consistent with international standards and the Constitution.   It was the judiciary and the legislature - and not the executive - that  determined the standards for the use of force to protect the property.   Police officers had been brought to courts for the use of excessive force and  there was an internal mechanism within the police force to deal with the  issue.  The courts had ruled both ways, in favour and against the police  officers.  In the weeks leading  to the elections in December 2019, the opposition continued to use the tools  from its playbook: threats, intimidation, disruption and propaganda war, which  - sadly - they seemed to be winning as the international media reported on a  \"massive demonstrations and civil unrest involving thousands of people\", even  though only several hundred people had demonstrated.  The action of the opposition  had threatened to derail the polling activities and had represented real and  serious threats to life and property, particularly in Salisbury and  Marigot.  They had blocked important roads and had pelted the police with  stones.  As a result, the police had acted to remove the blockade using  rubber bullets and tear gas.  The people of Marigot themselves had  unblocked the roads and there had been no need for the police  intervention.  Three police officers had been injured and there had been  no fatalities.  As for the questions  raised on forced labour and trafficking of children, the Committee had  said that the questions were being raised based on public information, which  was very worrying in some cases, said the delegation.  There must be a  limit to this, a minimum standard before a country was accused of the worst  forms of crimes under any standards, domestic or international.  There  should be an agreement on the use of words, the definitions and terms.   The delegation found that some of the reports Experts cited were void of  definitions and \"frivolous in their claims\".  That said, Dominica  did not appear before the Committee to \"defend the indefensible nor to burry  its head in the sand\" ; it was here to respond to questions on obligations it  had voluntarily accepted.  However, for the Committee Experts to state the  questions and make the comments in the way in which they had be presented was  \"offensive and misleading\".  One case of unlawful or abusive act,  especially against the children, was one case too many ; however, the question  gave the impression that there was a widespread abuse of children to which the  Government was turning a blind eye and there were no laws protecting children.The delegation then  examined the source of the allegations, including on commercial sexual  exploitation of children, and said that it was \"dishonest and misleading\" for  the Committee to challenge Dominica based on that report, which was loaded with  gaps and which could not stand a peer review.  Secondary education  was free of tuition costs and multiple programmes existed to support children  to stay in schools.  Dominica also had a number of measures to combat trafficking  in persons, including the Immigration and Passport Act that criminalized  human trafficking, the Transnational Organized Crime (Prevention and Control)  Act of 2013 and the National Action Plan on Child Sexual Abuse.  Five new  bills had been presented to the Cabinet of Dominica to tackle those issues  recently, to be approved later in the year.  The courts and the  jurisprudence of the Caribbean Court of Justice determined the criteria for the  protection of freedom of reputation.  The current Government had  not filed an injunction against an anticipated publication by any journalist  and had used the defamation laws to protect the reputation of the accused only  after the fact.  There was no  licensing regime for print media and press in Dominica, which operated  as companies under the Companies Act of 1994.  The broadcasting regime  covering radio and television stations was slightly different and they had to  receive broadcasting licenses under the Telecommunications Act of 2000, which  was part of the harmonized legislation of the States parties to the treaty  establishing the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunication Authority.  The  licenses were technical in nature and did not address the question of  content.  Journalists were not  prevented from going to Parliament and their attendance to its sessions were  limited by available space, dress code and the behaviour consistent to the  rules of the house.  The broadcasting of Parliamentary sessions by  national radio stations was mandatory.\n",
      "   Questions by  Committee ExpertsYUVAL SHANY, Committee  Vice-Chair, took note of Dominica's position concerning some of the  information presented by the Experts and the methodology used and explained  that, in monitoring the situation in countries, the Committee considered  information from a variety of sources, such as reports by the media and  non-governmental organizations or academic research.  The Committee then  put that information to the delegation to \"set the record straight\" in a public  broadcast.  The fact that a member of the Committee asked question based  on a report did not mean that the Committee itself had formed an opinion on the  issue or that it was \"accusing a State party of wrongdoing\".  The  Committee was using publicly available information, in full transparency,  reiterated the Vice-Chair.Turning to the independence  of the judiciary, the Experts raised concerns as judges relied on the  Government for housing and transportation, allegedly withholding this support  as a way of threatening judges.  They asked about the operation of  prosecutors and noted that the judicial delays in hearing civil claims could  still reach five years or more.  Criminal matters were also affected, with  sessions resuming only 15 months after the hurricane Maria.  The status of  free legal aid was concerning as it was only available in murder cases.  With regard to the freedom  of assembly, Experts raised concerns about the framework and application of  the Public Order Act, which prescribed mandatory permits for assemblies and  criminalized all assemblies held without such permit.  Allegedly, the Act  seemed to have been often used against political opposition around the time of  the general election.  Experts remained  concerned about prison overcrowding, monitoring mechanisms and pre-trial  detentions and asked whether the creation of an independent formal mechanism or  a prison Ombudsman position was being considered.  They asked whether corporal  punishment of children would be banned.  Noting the 2019 data from the  International Labour Organization, they expressed concern by sexual exploitation  of children and the use of children in illegal activities.  There was a  lack of information about the existing legislative framework to combat those  issues, they noted.The Experts further  asked about the development of a legal framework relating to asylum and  refugee status and asked about the rights of stateless persons and migrants  from Haiti to receive residency and citizenship.  Regarding the rights  of minorities, Committee Experts welcomed the efforts of the State party to  accommodate its indigenous groups of Kalinago people.  However, there was  insufficient education on the indigenous groups in the Caribbean, leading to  discrimination within the society.The Experts took  positive note if the effective implementation of the anti-corruption legislation  in general, however, the concern was raised about a lack of transparency in the  Citizen Investment Programme.  Experts noted the pending electoral law reform and highlighted reports of electoral fraud.\n",
      "   Responses by the  DelegationThe delegation said  that the legal aid office was not heavily staffed ; it routinely sought  to employ practitioners from various public and private institutions.   There was indeed a concern over the backlog of cases due to the recent  hurricanes and the 15 months pause was regrettable.  Land for the  construction of a new Hall of Justice was purchased but resources had been  redirected to rebuilding and relocating communities devastated by the hurricane  Maria.  Judges were appointed  by the Judicial Legal Service Commission chaired by the Chief Justice,  comprised of members serving for a period of three years.  The Government  did not use the provision of housing and transport services as a way of  threatening judges.  A reform was underway to strengthen the judicial  system.The expansion of the  capacity of the state prison allowed for the separation of convicted  detainees and those held on remand.  Measures alternative to detention  were not applied at the moment, an issue that could be addressed during the  ongoing judicial reform.The President  appointed the Director of the Public Prosecution, a position protected by the  Constitution ; the Director and all the prosecutorial staff were  women.  In addition, some police officers were designated as prosecutors,  but they were not involved in investigations.  The delegation  criticized the Committee for not using reports or evidence produced by the  Government and for relying instead on alternative sources, such as opposition  publications.  As for the freedom of  assembly, the delegation stressed that the police had acted within their rights  during the breakup of the public meetings of the opposition.  The leader  of the opposition had enflamed the situation by stating that the meeting would  not stop because of the presence of the police.  The Public Order Act was  applicable to public processions or gatherings in spaces in which an assembly  obstructed the daily activities of the public.  Discussions regarding  the status of refugees and asylum seekers took place, but no action had yet  been taken.  The Citizenship Act allowed the Government to grant permanent  residency and citizenship to migrants who met specific requirements.   Stateless persons could also receive citizenship.  Dominica's indigenous  peoples were well provided for ; land was under the communal ownership and  no developments could take place in the Kalinago territory without the approval  of the Kalinago council and chief.  Culture and history of the Kalinago  people were not taught in school because most of the textbooks were published  outside of the country.  The new minister for Kalinago affairs had already  indicated that more attention would be given to the question.Regarding corruption,  the delegation stated that a policy on the issuance of diplomatic passports did  exist and the Government acted on allegations about the transparency of the  process.  Turning to the elections,  the delegation said that the Government tried to issue voter identification  cards but there was violent opposition to this programme that aimed to ensure  that more people could vote.  The names of deceased people were being  removed from the voting lists as soon as the problem was detected.  The  average number of registered voters in a polling station was around 300 and  every candidate could have a representative at the station to monitor the  procedure and prevent fraud.  The reform of the electoral system was  ongoing, which would also address the question of campaign financing.  Asked about the  involvement of non-governmental organizations in the preparation of the  replies to list of issues, the delegation expressed hope that more  non-governmental organizations would participate in the process in the future.\n",
      "   Concluding RemarksVINCE HENDERSON, Ambassador  of Dominica to the United States of America and its Permanent Representative to  the Organisation of American States, in conclusion thanked the Committee  for their work, which Dominica admired and said he was concerned about the  Committee's sources, rather than its methods.  YUVAL SHANY, Committee  Vice-Chair, concluded by stating the Committee was pleased by the dialogue,  which made a big impression despite coming from such a small country.  As  a result, Mr. Shany hoped that the Committee would not have to wait another 27  years to review Dominica again. ___________ \n",
