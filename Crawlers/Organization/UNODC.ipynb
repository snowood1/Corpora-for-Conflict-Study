      "UNODC Monitoring Survey reports 14 per cent increase of coca bush cultivation in Bolivia during 2016\n",
      "\n",
      "La Paz/Vienna, 19 July 2017 - In 2016, coca bush cultivation increased 14 per cent in Bolivia compared to the previous year, according to the latest Coca Crop Monitoring Survey launched today in La Paz by UNODC and the Bolivian Government. In this period, the surface under cultivation increased from 20,200 hectares (ha) to 23,100 ha, following five years of continuous reduction (2011-2015).\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the same survey, Yungas de La Paz, Trópico de Cochabamba and Norte de La Paz provinces, respectively, accounted for 68, 31 and 1 per cent of the areas under cultivation in the country. Through the use of satellite imaging and field monitoring, a surge of coca bush cultivation was revealed in these three main areas. Compared to 2015, the cultivation in the Yungas de La Paz and Trópico de Cochabamba regions grew from 14,000 to 15,700 ha and from 6,000 to 7,200 ha, respectively. In the Norte de La Paz provinces, the surface increased from 150 to 240 ha.\n",
      "\n",
      "The highest increase of coca bush cultivation in Yungas de La Paz was detected in the Sud Yungas province, with a surge of 1,226 ha reaching 10,535 ha in 2016. Similarly, in Trópico de Cochabamba, the Chapare province saw an increase of 953 ha of coca bush cultivation, from 2,754 ha in 2015 to 3,707 ha in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, the Survey detected a net increase of 2,900 ha of coca bush cultivation and the Government of Bolivia reported a 40 per cent reduction of eradication from 11,020 to 6,577 ha. 64 per cent of the eradication results were achieved in the Trópico de Cochabamba, 22 per cent in the Yungas de La Paz and the Norte de La Paz provinces, whereas 14 per cent in Santa Cruz and Beni departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The potential coca leaf production in the country was estimated to be of 38,000 tons, a 17 per cent increase compared to 2015. During the same reporting period, the total value of the estimated coca leaf production slightly increased, from $273 to $276 million. This amount represents 0.8 per cent of Bolivia's GDP and 7.3 per cent of its agricultural sector GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Survey also detected coca bush cultivation in six out of 22 nationally protected areas, where a total surface of 253 ha of coca bush cultivation was discovered, an increase of 49 ha compared to the previous year. The national parks most affected by the cultivation were Carrasco, followed by Apolobamba, Cotapata and Isiboro Secure.\n",
      "\n",
      "These figures reflect the main findings of the latest Coca Crop Monitoring Survey in Bolivia, carried out in the framework of a UNODC Programme, which is financially supported by the European Union and Denmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Government ́s data, the amount of coca leaf traded in the two authorized markets - Villa Fátima and Sacaba - was around 22,000 tons in 2016, equivalent to 58 per cent of the estimated total production. 92 per cent of the legally traded coca leaf was marketed in Villa Fátima while the remaining 8 per cent took place in Sacaba. The average weighted price of coca leaf in these authorized markets decreased by 14 per cent, from $9.4 per kg in 2015 to $8.1 in 2016.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same data shows that coca leaf and cocaine paste seizures decreased by 2 and 4 per cent, respectively, from 362 to 353 tons and from around 12.7 to 12.2 tons. Whereas, seizures of cocaine hydrochloride increased by 107 per cent, from around 8.6 to 17.7 tons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking to the press, Antonino De Leo, UNODC Representative in Bolivia, expressed concern over the change of trends in coca bush cultivation and eradication witnessed in the country. He also stressed that \"the UNODC Coca Crop Monitoring Survey provides precious data, information and recommendations that will help the government to set in motion more effective strategies to tackle illicit coca cultivation in the country and the challenges posed by it to sustainable development.\"\n",

      "Opium production in Myanmar and the Lao People's Democratic Republic stabilizes at high levels, says UNODC report\n",
      "\n",
      "New UNODC survey notes stable opium cultivation in Lao PDR and Myanmar, cautions more needs to be done to address underlying causes of illicit cultivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vienna, 15 December 2015 - Opium poppy cultivation in the Golden Triangle stabilized in 2015 at 55,000 hectares (ha) in Myanmar, and 5,700 ha in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), according to the Southeast Asia Opium Survey 2015 released today by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).\n",
      "\n",
      "The survey shows that Myanmar remains Southeast Asia's top opium producer - and the world's second largest after Afghanistan. Together, Myanmar and Lao PDR produced between 731 metric tons (mt) and 823 mt of opium, most of which - using the smuggled precursor chemical acetic anhydride - was refined into the equivalent of roughly 73.1 mt to 82.3 mt of street-quality heroin for regional and international drug markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The production of opium and two-way trade of chemicals going in and heroin coming out of the Golden Triangle remains a clear challenge to the rule of law and stability of producing areas,\" said Jeremy Douglas, UNODC Regional Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \"The region's demand for heroin remains at unacceptably high levels and transnational organized crime groups are making huge profits. And while the stabilization of poppy cultivation in the past year is encouraging, the Government-elect of Myanmar and the Government of Lao PDR have no choice but to face the underlying issues that allow opium cultivation and related trafficking to continue.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Shan State in the north of Myanmar, which hosts a number of conflict areas and ceasefire groups, remains the centre of the country's opium and heroin trade, accounting for 91 per cent of opium poppy cultivation in the Golden Triangle. In Lao PDR, cultivation is found in the seven northern provinces of Phongsali, Houaphan, Louang Namtha, Louangphrabang, Oudomxai, Bokeo and Xiangkhoang.\n",
      "\n",
      "Socioeconomic surveys of farmers in poppy-growing villages have found that money generated from poppy cultivation is essential for villagers threatened with food insecurity and poverty. \"The connection between poppy cultivation and poverty, difficult living conditions, household debt, and a lack of alternative sources of income is clear,\" said Tun Nay Soe, coordinator of UNODC's SMART (Synthetics Monitoring: Analyses, Reporting and Trends) Programme in Southeast Asia. \"Opium poppy is cultivated because it provides a means of subsistence in the face of poverty.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Douglas also warned that the opium and heroin business threatens well-intentioned regional development plans. \"The Golden Triangle is the geographic centre of the Greater Mekong Sub-region. Plans to expand transport connections and relax trade and border controls, including around opium producing areas, are either on the table or underway,\" Mr. Douglas said. \"The organized crime networks that benefit from Southeast Asia's illicit drug trade are very well positioned to grow their business alongside these rapid changes. Both Myanmar and Lao PDR need support to turn the situation around.\"\n",

      "21 April 2016 - UNODC Executive Director, Yury Fedotov, urged the international community to seize the opportunity provided by the UN General Assembly special session (UNGASS) on the world drug problem to address shared challenges. He also pledged UNODC's support for putting the session's recommendations into practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must take advantage of the momentum provided by UNGASS to strengthen cooperation and advance comprehensive, balanced, integrated rights-based approaches that help to protect and promote the health, safety and security of people everywhere,\" said Mr. Fedotov.\n",
      "\n",
      "The landmark special session, only the third such meeting held by the UN General Assembly on global drug policy, concluded on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the opening of the plenary, Member States adopted the outcome document of the session, which reaffirms their commitment to undertake innovative approaches to drug control within the framework of the three international drug control conventions. It also recognizes that the conventions allow for sufficient flexibility for States parties to design effective national drug policies according to priorities and needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The outcome document recommends measures to address demand and supply reduction, and to improve access to controlled medicines while preventing diversion. The recommendations also cover the areas of human rights, youth, children, women and communities; emerging challenges, including new psychoactive substances; strengthening international cooperation; and alternative development.\n",
      "\n",
      "The text puts new emphasis on proportionate national sentencing policies and practices for drug-related offences, and features a strong focus on prevention and treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fedotov underscored UNODC's long-standing experience in supporting Member States in all of these areas, and welcomed the document's recognition that \"efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to effectively address the world drug problem are complementary and mutually reinforcing\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whether we are talking about illicit cultivation, production, trafficking or use, the world drug problem is closely interlinked with development challenges - a fact that has also been clearly recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,\" said Mr. Fedotov.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The outcome document provides a strong framework for moving forward, and UNODC is committed to working with all countries to put its recommendations into action.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In his remarks, he highlighted UNODC's support to address challenges including new psychoactive substances and exploitation of the internet for trafficking; to promote the use of reliable, objective data and evidence-based policies; and to strengthen international cooperation, as well as advance work to develop sustainable livelihoods.\n",
      "\n",

      "Speaking at the 15 th Session of the United Nations Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Vienna, she said all governments needed to make the fight against human trafficking a priority.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Trafficking is one of the most egregious violations of human rights in the 21 st century. I ask all Member States, at a minimum, to sign and ratify the Protocols,\" Julia said. \"It is not acceptable that law enforcement in any country should be under-staffed, under-equipped and under-funded in the fight against trafficking.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted in 2003, has been signed by 147 countries and ratified by 118. The accompanying Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, has been signed by 117 states and ratified by 97.\n",
      "\n",
      "Julia, who was appointed UNODC Goodwill Ambassador in December 2005, said she had been shocked by the scale of the trafficking problem - not just for sexual exploitation but also for forced labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It costs as little as $50 to buy a healthy 18-year-old boy in Mali, who can then be trafficked and shipped to the Ivory Coast and sold into modern-day slavery,\" she said. This was a fraction of the cost of a young male slave in the American Deep South in the 1850s, which was the equivalent of around $38,000 in today's money.\n",

      "\"Once he is under the farmer's physical control, the farmer gets the entire productive capacity, the embodied labour, of this young man for as long as the farmer can control and exploit him,\" Julia said.\n",

      "\n",
      "5 December 2016 - In order to reduce opioid overdose deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended in its Community Management of Opioid Overdose Guidelines (2014) that the opioid antidote naloxone, as well as training in opioid overdose management, should be made available to people likely to witness an overdose, such as health professionals, police, people who use opioids, their families and peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response to this, over the next two days UNODC and WHO are organizing a meeting which aims to develop and discuss a draft Study Protocol on the feasibility of such approach to opioid overdose. The Technical Meeting comes in response to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) resolution on \"Promoting measures to prevent drug overdose, in particular opioid overdose\" and the Outcome Document of the 2016 UNGASS on the World Drug Problem and following field assessment missions in Central Asia and Eastern Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Naloxone (n-allylnoroxymorphone) has been used in opioid overdose management for over 40 years with minimal adverse effects beyond the induction of opioid withdrawal symptoms, and it can be administered by a variety of routes, including intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously and intranasally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The draft Study Protocol outlines the rationale and procedures, as well as the suggested outcome measures, for a joint UNODC/WHO supported multi-site feasibility study on the comprehensive management of opioid overdose in the community. A specific emphasis of the study will be to assess the feasibility of increasing the availability of naloxone including intranasal naloxone formulations in different sites for the community management of opioid overdose.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week's meeting is organized within the framework of a UNODC/WHO joint Programme on Drug Dependence Treatment and Care, which aims to promote and support worldwide evidence-based and ethical treatment policies, strategies and interventions -with a particular focus on low and middle-income countries - to reduce the health and social burden caused by drug use and dependence. Its overall goal is to better estimate the public health impact of the community management of opioid overdose prevention, including the use of intranasal naloxone formulations. The implementation of the protocol is open to countries (or scientific groups within countries) that wish to join this multi-country study with their resources.\n",

      "Together with her sister, Skye escaped the brothel, returned to school, and now works for the Nepalese organization who rescued her: the globally renowned Shakti Samuha. But for every survivor like Skye, thousands are suffering in silence, gagged by the threat of violence and blackmail.\n",

This is the harsh evidence of a crime that haunts all our societies.\n",

      "\n",
      "18 January 2011 - Pakistan cricket star Shahid Afridi has been appointed UNODC National Goodwill Ambassador in recognition of his outstanding sporting record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both batsman and bowler, Afridi is a talented all-rounder who from 2009 to 2011 was captain of the Pakistan national cricket team in various formats of the modern game.\n",
      "\n",
      "He became an overnight sensation in 1996 when, as a 16-year-old, he made history by scoring the fastest century in a one-day international (ODI) in his very first innings. \"Boom-boom Afridi\", as he is affectionately known to his legions of fans, goes all-out for runs instead of contenting himself with defending his wicket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He plays with heart,\" said Jeremy Douglas, UNODC Representative in Pakistan, of the appointment. \"Shahid Afridi is a role model who can speak powerfully against drug abuse. Young people see in him the courage to push away boundaries and the will to go on when things get tough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I have never done anything by halves and I will give my all to my new role of National Goodwill Ambassador. I hate to see drugs ruin the lives of young people. If I can convince just one boy or girl to turn away from drugs I will be proud,\" said Mr. Afridi on accepting his two-year assignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Afridi will promote healthy living though sports and emphasize positive values and attitudes during visits to schools and colleges. In 2012, he will witness the impact of the work of UNODC in Pakistan and highlight the need to curb drug abuse and associated crime. He is expected to take part in a range of activities, such as a youth cricket tournament; the marking of International Day against Drug Abuse (26 June); raising awareness of the importance of ethics in sports; advocating gender-responsive services for drug abusers; and promoting knowledge of drug-related and HIV/AIDS issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shahid Afridi has roots in Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa Province and lives in Karachi. He has played 27 tests, 325 ODIs and 43 Twenty 20 internationals and holds the distinction of having hit the most sixes in the history of ODI cricket. In 2011, Afridi led the national team to the semi-final of the Cricket World Cup and in 2012 he will play various ODI and Twenty-20 fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Afridi has been involved in humanitarian efforts in the past, including efforts supporting the emergency response after the catastrophic flood that hit Pakistan in 2010.\n",

      "UNODC, Japan gather countries from Asia, Middle-East and North Africa to protect children affected by terrorism and violent extremism\n",
      "\n",
      "26 March 2019 - The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Government of Japan gathered representatives from Asia, the Middle-East and North Africa in Tokyo from 12 to 14 March, to present three training manuals on the treatment of children recruited and exploited by terrorist and violent extremist groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manuals complement the UNODC Handbook, the first United Nations publication offering international guidance on design of coherent and effective policies for the prevention and treatment of these children, based on the in-depth analysis of relevant international law. Since 2015, UNODC has been providing technical assistance to support over 20 countries in different regions of the world addressing this urgent and complex phenomenon.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past years, thousands of children have been recruited by terrorist groups, and exploited in different roles, as suicide bombers, sexual slaves, informants. With violent extremist propaganda heavily relying on images of children being normalised and used to perpetrate violence, this issue has come to the forefront of the international agenda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nowadays, with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL/Da'esh) losing ground, many of these children are held in camps in Syria and Iraq. Among them, there are also foreign children, many born in formerly ISIL controlled territory from foreign parents who had joined the group. Facing such difficult circumstances, countries are struggling to find the appropriate response to the treatment of those children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The workshop in Tokyo was an initiative under the UNODC Global Programme to End Violence against Children, funded and co-organised by the Government of Japan. \"Understanding different cultures and showing generosity to end conflict is core to Japan's approach to development assistance\" said H.E. Eiji Yamamoto, Ambassador in charge of International Cooperation for Countering Terrorism and International Organized Crime of Japan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The event saw the participation of delegations from Bangladesh, Iraq, Lebanon, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Tunisia, who took part in active discussions, training exercises and presented promising practices to overcome the challenges associated with the phenomenon. Participants also heard the direct testimonies of children through the screening of \"Ashbal - Lion Cubs of ISIL\", a documentary that explores the experiences of former child recruits, who escaped the group. \"These children want to be children again\" said François-Xavier Trégan, the movie director, but \"there was no help to be found for them to address the trauma they have been through\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the nine delegations contributed to the elaboration of a \"UNODC Roadmap for action\". This document, which integrates UNODC's approach and greatly benefitted from the delegates' experience, will serve to direct future UNODC's engagement in this area.\n",
      "\n",
      "With renewed emphasis on the need to focus on the prevention of child recruitment, the Roadmap also emphasizes investment in rehabilitation and reintegration of these children as a priority. In particular, reintegration programmes should be based on an individualised approach, and include a focus on trauma-informed care, as well as on peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Building on its dual mandate on violence against children and counter-terrorism, UNODC is ideally positioned to work on this issue. \"Children associated with terrorist groups are primarily victims of recruitment by these groups, a serious form of violence against children: there is no dichotomy between security interests and the protection of those children. UNODC reiterated its readiness to continue supporting countries in pursuing the complementary objectives of preserving public safety and protecting children\", said Alexandra Martins, the UNODC representative. In concluding the meeting, Japan announced its continued financial support to UNODC in this area, alongside Austria, Canada, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland.\n",

      "The UNODC head noted that strong relationships with inter-governmental organizations were also essential to counter drugs and crime.

      "\n",
      "16 October 2012 - UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov today announced the launch of a new tool in the fight against organized crime. The announcement was made at an event attended by the Minister of the Interior of Italy and other distinguished guests. The Digest of Organized Crime is based on an analysis of more than 200 cases and the accumulated knowledge of over 50 experts. It will ultimately allow policymakers from around the world to understand the experiences of crime fighters and to incorporate these experiences into their own strategies against criminals and criminal networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking at the launch, the UNODC Executive Director acknowledged the need for such a tool, given the vast diversity of crime. \"Organized crime groups engage in many different criminal activities and markets. Drug trafficking is one prominent example; others include trafficking in persons and cultural property, extortion, cybercrime and piracy,\" he said. The Digest illustrates the challenges and opportunities that confront law enforcement and the judiciary when dealing with organized crime. To develop the Digest, UNODC has worked with the Governments of Colombia and Italy, as well as the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Minister for the Interior of Italy, Anna Maria Cancellieri, noted that \"The digest is proposed as a practical tool of cases and techniques in the countries party to the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime\". Brigadier General Jose Angel Mendoza Guzman of the Colombian National Police added that \"Crime is interlinked, complex, asymmetrical, and the management of knowledge is a tactic in the fight against this challenge\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fedotov said that the lessons that could be learned from the Digest were strikingly simple: \"To effectively combat organized crime, countries must dismantle the criminal organization as a whole, bring the ringleaders to justice, deprive them of their illegal profits and prevent them from laundering money.\" The Assistant Director of the Specialized Crime and Analysis Unit of INTERPOL, Gianni Baldi, said that his own organization was \"pleased to take part with UNODC, Italy and Colombia to finalize the Digest\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch of the Digest took place on the margins of the sixth session of Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which brings together more than 800 people, including representatives of Member States and civil society, to discuss organized crime. \"The cases in the Digest offer abundant information,\" noted Gioacchino Polimeni, the main drafter of the report. \"They show, inter alia, that we need to expand criminal investigation to cover the entire structure in criminal conduct of organized groups or networks, not just some of the offences they have committed.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "18 July 2016 - Today marks the day Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born. Since 2010, the United Nations celebrates Nelson Mandela International Day to recognise the former South African President's outstanding contribution to a culture of peace and freedom. For the first time this year, the United Nations also uses today's occasion to draw attention to the more than 10 million prisoners worldwide as well as to the work of those entrusted with their safe, secure and humane custody.\n",

      "Please click on the image to enlarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the memory of Nelson Mandela in mind, who himself had to spend 27 years of his life in prison, the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners in December 2015 as \"the Nelson Mandela Rules\". The rules resulted from five years of inter-governmental consultations, and represent a landmark harmonization of the original version (1957) with international law and good prison management practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, UNODC and its partners are echoing the General Assembly's call to also celebrate Nelson Mandela International Day with a view to promote humane conditions of imprisonment, to raise awareness about prisoners being a continuous part of society and to value the important work of prison staff. A lot of work remains to be done - overcrowding, inadequate prison conditions, violence, recidivism, as well as emerging threats, such as the risk of violent extremism, pose tremendous challenges to numerous prison administrations. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon equally used today's occasion to remind the international community that \"prisoners deserve humane treatment and full respect for their dignity as human beings.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Please click on the image to enlarge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through its Field Offices, and in close coordination with their national counterparts, UNODC colleagues around the world are therefore engaged in various outreach activities to mark this International Day. Be it in Bolivia, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Mauritius, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, Panama or the United Arab Emirates - 18 July this year goes along with a vibrant plea to treat prisoners in line with their inherent dignity as human beings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I call on every country to join UNODC in ensuring that the Nelson Mandela Rules make a difference to the lives of prisoners globally\", stressed UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov, adding that UNODC stands ready to assist. As the custodian of the Nelson Mandela Rules, UNODC has indeed been proactive in turning them into action by launching a new Global Programme on Addressing Prison Challenges. Building on its long-standing experience and expertise in in the field of prison reform, this comprehensive Programme is focussing on providing technical assistance and advisory services to (i) reduce the scope of imprisonment; (ii) improve prison conditions and strengthening prison management; and (iii) support the social reintegration of prisoners upon release.\n",

      "South Africa, homeland of Nelson Mandela and host of the final meeting of the Expert Group on the revision of the Standard Minimum Rules in Cape Town, is partnering closely with UNODC in promoting the practical application of the Nelson Mandela Rules. In this vein, the Permanent Mission of South Africa to the United Nations (Vienna), together with UNODC, plans to establish a \"Group of Friends of the Nelson Mandela Rules\". An informal and open-ended group of like-minded Member States such as this can greatly help to keep the momentum created by the adoption of the Nelson Mandela Rules, and to facilitate consultations on prison reform, including in the course of future sessions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.\n",

      "UNODC early warning system records rapid increase in legal highs in 2013\n",
      "\n",
      "Vienna, 9 September 2013. Amidst figures showing a sharp rise in the number of reported new psychoactive substances (NPS), international experts met last week to address this growing challenge. Over the past 12 months, the number of NPS reported to UNODC rose by 41 per cent, from 251 to 354, while countries reporting detection of these substances climbed from 70 to 90.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marketed as 'legal highs' or 'designer drugs' and sold openly, including via the internet, NPS formulations are outpacing efforts to impose international control. Criminals have been quick to tap into this lucrative market. Uncontrolled and therefore not tested for safety, their potential for harm is far greater than that of traditional drugs.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNODC's Executive Director Yury Fedotov noted the urgency of responding to this trend: \"The adverse effects of NPS are poorly understood and present a global health risk. Concerted action is urgently needed by the international community to prevent the manufacture, trafficking and abuse of these drugs. UNODC is playing a leading role in addressing this challenge by launching an early warning advisory system on NPS, which is the first global reference point on these substances.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting brought together some of the world's lead organizations working to tackle this threat, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the World Customs Organization (WCO), the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), as well as experts from 22 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the meeting in Vienna, Austria, experts acknowledged that while the current international drug conventions have all the necessary tools to address NPS, keeping track and controlling these substances is still a challenge.

      "In June 2013, UNODC launched an early warning advisory system on NPS. The portal offers up-to-date information and validated identification techniques, including chemical structures, as well as reported adverse effects. It also compiles different types of legislative measures taken so far to respond to the challenge at the national level, as well as studies on NPS toxicology, use and treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the same month, the 2013 World Drug Report highlighted that, while the use of traditional drugs such as heroin and cocaine seems to be declining in some parts of the world, the abuse of prescription drugs and NPS is growing. For the first time, the number of NPS (251 as of mid-2012) exceeded the total number of substances under international control (234), posing an unforeseen challenge to Member States in addressing the world drug problem.\n",

      "\n",
      "8 August 2008 - Corruption is a complex social, political and economic phenomenon that affects both public and private sectors of all countries. Yet anti-corruption work is often hampered by conflicting needs and low levels of understanding between these two sectors. In fact, public officials and private company representatives tend to blame one another for soliciting or offering bribes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United Nations Convention against Corruption - the world's only global legal instrument against corruption - has the potential to safeguard the interests of both private and public sectors. It calls upon governments to become more transparent and accountable. It also creates an opportunity to develop a common global language against corruption and can set universal standards to be used by both sectors to increase integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recognizing the Convention's potential, as well as the role UNODC can play to tackle this global problem as the Convention's custodian, representatives of large multinational corporations such as Petrobras (petroleum/energy), ABB (power/automation), Coca-Cola (beverages), SAP (software) and BBVA (bank) met with representatives from civil society, labour associations and international organizations in Vienna recently to decide on the road ahead for anti-corruption work.\n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting was held within the framework of the UN Global Compact, the world's largest voluntary global corporate responsibility initiative. The 10th principle of the Global Compact urges companies worldwide to work against corruption in all forms and manifestations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants at the Vienna meeting decided to synchronize private and public sector anti-corruption agendas and to find ways to work together towards a goal that would ultimately benefit both.\n",
      "\n",
      "To understand each other's positions and limitations, participants also called for more public-private partnerships. The corporate community's support to countries' efforts to implement the UN anti-corruption Convention is a recognition that the treaty can work as an \"insurance policy\" for companies. Furthermore, it is a recognition that strengthening the integrity of countries where companies do business is a powerful way to safeguard their investments.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Public-private partnership is the best way to reconcile diverging perceptions which may generate conflicts and opportunities for corruption,\" says UNODC Anti-Corruption Expert Giovanni Gallo, \"particularly in the area of public procurement, where the two actors interact the most and where they have now agreed to work more closely together.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "1 February 2008 - The Second Conference of the States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption has just concluded in Bali, Indonesia. Summing up, UNODC Executive Director Antonio Maria Costa says: \"I think it is fair to say that we took three steps forward, even if they are not great leaps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The first step is that the Conference has brought a greater understanding of countries' capacities and needs as a result of the self-assessment. The methodology used has thus been tested and proven successful, which allows for more focused implementation. Governments have asked UNODC to expand this approach to cover all measures of the Convention and aim for a 100% response rate. Doing so would give the Office a solid basis of evidence on which to make a credible review of implementation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, the review mechanism has moved from a blank canvas two years ago to a sketch at present. While there is some disappointment that the mechanism has not been finalized, at least there is agreement on its guiding principles, its terms of reference are taking shape, there are a growing number of eager test pilots, and the working group has its marching orders. UNODC will continue to push for the activation of the review mechanism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, the Bali session has showcased the range of technical assistance that is available and focused attention on where it is most urgently needed. Several stakeholders have expressed support for the technical assistance provided by UNODC. And by having an even more active presence on the ground, the Office can better meet the diverse needs of different countries, and ensure that this important work builds on real-life experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Inspiration for future anti-corruption work can be drawn from the StAR Initiative where UNODC and the World Bank are working in tandem. There is a high level of interest among countries and several have come forward to take part in this initiative. Over the next year, the two partners will focus on a handful of cases (maximum half a dozen) in order to put the Initiative to the test and develop experience that can be applied more broadly\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the various special events held in Bali over the past week show that the anti-corruption alliance is strong and that the number of stakeholders is growing. Judging from participants' feedback, so is their shared sense of responsibility for tackling corruption.\n",

      "Vienna, 7 November 2016 - Links between terrorists and criminal networks are a clear danger to peacekeeping operations, the Executive Director of the UNODC, Yury Fedotov, told the Security Council today.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fedotov was speaking at a Security Council open debate on peacekeeping operations facing asymmetrical threats that was also addressed by the UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson. The debate was chaired by the Foreign Minister of Senegal, Mankeur Ndiaye and other speakers included Jean-Paul Laborde, the Executive Director of the Counter Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In Afghanistan, the Taliban levies payments from drug traffickers in exchange for protecting them. ISIL in the Middle East is profiting from the illicit trafficking in cultural property, oil and kidnapping for ransom,\" said Mr. Fedotov.\n",
      "\n",
      "He went on to say that West African criminals paid terrorists for safe passage as they trafficked people, weapons, drugs and tobacco across the Sahel and Sahara and onwards to Europe. In Nigeria, the Executive Director pointed to Boko Haram's involvement in criminal activities and said in Somalia, al-Shabaab received income from illicit charcoal exports and piracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fedotov identified violent extremism as another challenge to peacekeeping missions. He welcomed the UN Secretary-General's formation of a high-level action group on the subject and said: \"UNODC seeks to implement a number of capacity building projects to improve criminal justice systems and promote the rule of law.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "UNODC's projects, undertaken with its partners, cover prevention of radicalization and violence in prisons; preventing the recruitment of terrorists, and foreign terrorist fighters, including through the Internet; supporting terrorism victims; and developing regional and national action plans to prevent violent extremism, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fedotov said many of these projects focused on the Sahel, as well as West, North and East African countries and were delivered through UNODC's offices on the ground. He stressed that UNODC's work in Africa was also enhanced by its partnerships especially with the Department of Peackeeping Operations (DPKO), but also with the G5 Sahel, Department of Political Affairs (DPA)/the UN Office for West Africa (UNOWAS) and INTERPOL.\n",

      "Statement by the UNODC Executive Director on the recent executions in Indonesia\n",
      "\n",
      "Vienna, 29 July 2016 - The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), as part of the United Nations Secretariat, opposes the death penalty in every circumstance, and regrets that the appeal of the Secretary-General to stop the execution of a number of prisoners for alleged drug-related crimes was not heeded.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the leading entity in the UN system for addressing and countering the world drug problem, UNODC stresses that the death penalty is not supported by the international drug control conventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the Secretary-General has emphasized, the United Nations opposes the use of capital punishment in all circumstances. Under international law, if the death penalty is to be used at all, it should only be imposed for the \"most serious crimes,\" namely those involving intentional killing. Drug crimes are generally not considered to meet this threshold.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNODC, in view of its broad mandate addressing the challenges of drugs, crime, corruption and terrorism, will continue to support every country to intercept and interrupt drug trafficking; to bring drug traffickers to justice with the appropriate legal safeguards; and to promote drug use prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, with the aim of protecting the health, safety and welfare of people and communities everywhere.\n",
