      "United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, Juan Méndez, is currently visiting Tajikistan to assess measures taken by the Tajik government to bring its torture prohibition legislation into compliance with international standards.\n",
      "Mr. Mendez has noted that while the Tajik government has taken some steps to reduce the incidence of human rights violations, “there remain significant gaps in legislation, policies and law enforcement practices…” He specifically noted his intention to examine “…how the authorities comply with the universal obligations to afford victims of torture an effective remedy and to investigate, prosecute, and punish every episode of torture.”\n",
      "This is Mr. Mendez’s second official visit to Central Asia since he was appointed Special Rapporteur in November 2010. Following his December 2011 visit to Kyrgyzstan, he noted that the “lack of effective safeguards against torture and ill treatment and the insignificant sanction provide for the crime of torture inevitable created an environment conducive to impunity.”\n",
      "PHR affirms Mr. Mendez’s conclusions and remains deeply engaged in activities designed to break the vicious circle of impunity by documenting and investigating torture cases.\n",
      "Although the scale of torture varies among the countries of Central Asia, it is generally widespread at police stations, detention centers, and prisons. A high degree of corruption and lack of public education and awareness about torture contribute to the silence in which torture occurs. The victims or their relatives fear to press for punishment of perpetrators and do not trust the judiciary and the law. \n",
      "In recent months PHR has conducted individual forensic medical evaluations for torture victims, as well as provided training to medical and legal professionals from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan so that they are able to effectively document and investigate allegations of torture.\n",
      "We also met with prosecutors, judges, and government officials to assist with development of National Preventative Mechanisms (NPMs) for preventing and protecting against torture. We are currently in the process of assessing further country-specific needs for these three countries as well as for Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Georgia.\n",
      "We look forward to continuing to work together with Mr. Mendez and other representatives of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on the effective documentation and investigation of torture and ill treatment in Tajikistan and other Central Asian countries.\n",

      "Last week, Human Rights Watch reported that the Iraqi government repeatedly targeted and attacked Fallujah General Hospital in Anbar province. Fallujah is a pivotal city in Sunni-majority Anbar province, which has long accused the Shia-dominated central government of persecution. In January 2014, political tensions that had been simmering for over a year escalated into outright violence between paramilitary groups and Iraqi security forces.\n",
      "Although the government has denied attacking Fallujah General Hospital, the weapons used in the attacks – mortar shells, direct fire weapons, and barrel bombs – are consistent with Iraqi military equipment. In deliberately attacking the hospital, the government of Iraq has unfortunately followed the nefarious example of its Syrian neighbor.\n",
      "The conflicts in Syria and Iraq possess unique traits, but they share some underlying factors. Both conflicts began as a series of peaceful protests advocating for reform over legitimate grievances. Both witnessed largely peaceful movements hijacked by extremists. Now, both governments have violated international law by attacking medical facilities, which are specially protected entities under the laws of war. As is often the case, innocent civilians have suffered the highest costs in these conflicts.\n",
      "Whether a country is run by a brutal dictatorship like the Assad regime or claims to be a nascent democracy as Iraq does, the decision to inflict maximum suffering on a civilian population by decimating the local health care system is inexcusable. Nothing justifies intentional attacks on health care workers who pledge to heal the sick and injured regardless of political affiliation. The international community must uphold international law and not allow this to become the new norm in conflict. Perpetrators must face justice and be held accountable for targeting the health community in Iraq, Syria, and beyond.\n",

      "For Immediate Release\n",
      "The Defense Department today released the redacted report of its internal investigation into the U.S. military airstrike on a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan. Since the attack last October, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) has been pressing the White House and the Pentagon to consider a criminal inquiry in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n",
      "Here is PHR's response to today’s report, attributable to PHR Executive Director Donna McKay:\n",
      "“The decision to dole out only administrative punishments and forego a thorough criminal investigation of October’s deadly strike in Kunduz is an affront to the families of the more than 40 men, women, and children who died that night, punished merely for being in a hospital, a supposed safe haven in a time of war.\n",
      "“In our correspondence with the White House and the Pentagon and in our public statements, we’ve stressed that a complete accounting must take place, and that victims and their families must receive full and effective reparation. The U.S. government has acknowledged its mistakes and apologized for them, and today’s report demonstrates a good-faith investigation by the military and its leadership.\n",
      "“But good-faith is not enough. There are laws — even in the heat of warfare — which must be followed. And no one is above them. Period. While the Kunduz strike may have been a mistake, some mistakes may be criminal. Mere reprimands, while potentially career-ending, are no substitute for a full criminal investigation. Sidestepping such an investigation is an offense to the standards of justice and accountability the U.S. espouses internationally.\n",
      "“When justice is served, it provides a modicum of accountability, an example for others to follow. But today, justice for the patients who died in their beds, the doctors and nurses and hospital staff killed while doing their jobs, was denied.”\n",

      "“Attention ALLwater customers: To be compliant with new laws concerning immigration you musthave an Alabama driver’s license or an Alabama picture ID card on file at thisoffice… or you may lose water service.” (Sign posted in the offices of apublic water company in the small town of Allgood, Alabama)\n",
      "This warning is the manifestation of Section 30 of Alabama’sextreme anti-immigrant law, HB56, which makes it a felony for someone withoutproper immigration papers to try to enter into a “business transaction” withthe “state or political subdivision of the state.” While the law is unclear asto what exactly constitutes a “business transaction” or what state actors areaffected, it appears to include contracts with utility companies that provideAlabama residents with the basic essentials of life. Violation of this sectionis a Class C felony, punishable by up to ten years in prison. This means thatundocumented people in Alabama may be incarcerated for a decade for trying toaccess running water for their homes.\n",
      "Such denial of basic facilities is part of a harshreductionist strategy called “attrition through enforcement” which is designedto make life so difficult for immigrants that they will return to their homecountries. This doctrine was first articulated by the anti-immigrant Center forImmigration Studies in 2005, and has been increasingly advanced by hard-lineRepublican Congressmen who are vehemently opposed to comprehensive immigrationreform. Ultimately, the goal behind “attrition through enforcement” is toachieve the mass removal of millions of immigrants from the US.\n",
      "This “self-deportation” avoids both the financial costs andbad press of rounding up immigrant families and deporting them. Hardliners hopethey will buy their own tickets because daily life in the US involves suchhardship. The fear and intentional dislocation that HB56 is designed to spur seemsto be working. Since the law went into effect, Latino families are leavingAlabama in droves. Businesses are closing; employers are wondering where theirworkers have gone, classroom desks are empty.\n",
      "Access to clean water is considered a basic human right-just like the right to food and the right to live without torture. The UnitedNational General Assembly approved a resolution last year stating so. Althoughthe resolution is not legally enforceable, it symbolically places a politicalobligation on governments not to restrict access to clean drinking water toanyone who resides within its borders. Alabama’s law is, therefore, not onlyinhumane, but defies this commitment. \n",
      "On October 5, the Department of Justice’s request thatimplementation of the law be suspended until the pending court cases areresolved, was rejected. While the appeal winds its way through the courts, theestimated 130,000 undocumented immigrants in Alabama are at risk of losing orbeing denied access to clean water. This is nothing short of a humanitariancrisis – right here at home – and virtually no one is reporting on it, exceptthe UK newspaper, The Guardian.Our astonishment that a circumscribed class of people in the US could betargeted for denial of water is rivaled only by our disappointment in the USmedia for failing to notice.\n",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic has left no community unscathed. In some countries, health workers face personal protective equipment shortages; in others, governments actively exploit the pandemic to restrict rights to freedom of speech or assembly and suppress access to information about COVID-19. But even in this challenging context, the pursuit of justice for some of the most heinous atrocities of the last century across the globe has not stopped. \n",
      "Today is International Justice Day, marking the twenty-second anniversary of the adoption of the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC exists as a last resort to hold powerful actors accountable for the most serious human rights abuses. It is a beacon of hope against impunity when domestic legal systems are unwilling or unable to hold leaders accountable for grave crimes. Since the ICC’s establishment in 2002, human rights advocates, legal practitioners, victims of atrocities, faith-based organizations, and other constituencies have often looked to the Court to complement and reinforce their work for justice, prospects for lasting peace, and respect for the dignity of all. \n",
      "As Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) draws attention to the profound threats facing health workers and communities worldwide because of the pandemic, these grave human rights issues still remain top of mind. Accountability is needed now more than ever for sexual violence in conflict and war crimes and crimes against humanity in Afghanistan, Myanmar, Rwanda, Sudan, and Syria. Here are five international justice issues you should pay attention to as we acknowledge International Criminal Justice Day. #JusticeMatters\n",
      "In May 2020, after 25 years on the run, one of the most wanted fugitives from Rwanda’s 1994 genocide – Félicien  Kabunga – was arrested in France. His alleged crimes include financing Hutu extremists who raped, pillaged, burned homes and churches, and massacred some 800,000 people. As founder and lead funder of the infamous Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines, Kabuga is also accused of managing a propaganda machine that instructed people to go out and kill members of Rwanda’s minority Tutsi.\n",
      "Holding Kabunga to account is something PHR has worked towards for decades. We contributed to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) investigations by organizing forensic scientists to exhume and examine a large mass grave. A shocking 70 percent of the bodies belonged to women and children. In 1997, Kabunga was charged with crimes against humanity and genocide by the ICTR in Arusha, Tanzania. Kabunga’s arrest has reignited hope and we look forward to the day when justice will be served for the victims of his crimes.\n",
      "In August 2017, security forces and civilians in Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state led brutal attacks against Rohingya women, men, and children. PHR has documented the scale and scope of the violence perpetrated, and we have evidence that Myanmar’s government and civilians launched a campaign of widespread and systematic violence with the support of the military and security forces. The United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar has said that the government’s violent operations against the Rohingya bear “the hallmarks of a genocide.”\n",
      "More than two years after the violence, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) supported The Gambia’s request that the Myanmar government take all necessary actions to protect the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority from the threats of genocide. This ICJ decision on the request for provisional measures, issued in January 2020, marks an important milestone toward accountability for Myanmar’s crimes against the Rohingya and was the court’s first official response to The Gambia’s official complaint of Myanmar’s violations of the United Nations’ 1948 Genocide Convention. \n",
      "As we approach the third anniversary on August 25 of these atrocities, PHR reiterates its support for parallel legal proceedings underway that give some promise to victims of future justice and accountability. These proceedings include the ICC’s investigation into the alleged crimes against humanity of the deportation of Rohingya civilians across the Myanmar-Bangladesh border.\n",
      "In March 2020, the ICC cleared the way for an investigation into possible war crimes in Afghanistan since 2003, when the country became party to the Rome Statute. The ruling authorized an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, including abuses committed by the U.S. armed forces and intelligence personnel, the Taliban, Afghan National Security Forces, and other combatants in the country.\n",
      "The ICC probe will also investigate potential war crimes, such as torture or inhuman treatment conducted by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in secret detention facilities in Afghanistan, as well as in CIA black sites in Lithuania, Poland, and Romania.\n",
      "This ruling is potentially a major turning point for the pursuit of truth, justice, and accountability at the international level. Yet, the United States is taking punitive measures against ICC investigators and prosecutors as well as other groups supporting the Court’s work. PHR urges the administration to be a powerful voice for justice and accountability for mass atrocities and reverse the steps it has announced, and we urge members of Congress to clearly and publicly oppose this policy. No one is above the law, regardless of how powerful or how influential.\n",
      "Since 2011, the Syrian government has systematically tortured civilians, among them health professionals who frequently have been in the position of capturing the evidence of brutal crimes committed by the government. Nine years later, despite the widespread sense of impunity enjoyed by the Syrian regime with the backing of its Russian and Iranian allies, Syrian regime officials are being prosecuted in national courts. In April 2020, a landmark trial on state torture began in Koblenz, Germany against Anwar R. and Eyad A., an alleged former intelligence officer and a lower-ranking subordinate at Syria’s General Intelligence Directorate.\n",
      "Because Syria is not a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC is not authorized to investigate crimes in Syria without a referral by the UN Security Council. Yet, Germany’s laws allow for universal jurisdiction for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Due to the large numbers of Syrian asylum seekers and refugees in Germany, previously unavailable victims, witnesses, material evidence, and even some suspects are now within the reach of the judicial authorities there.\n",
      "As evidence builds for these crimes, Germany and other European states must continue to actively explore all avenues available for criminal accountability for those accused of the gravest crimes and for the continued attacks on Syria’s civilian population.\n",
      "Last month, the ICC announced that Darfur militia leader Ali Kushayb was being held in its detention center on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity after surrendering in the Central African Republic. Kushayb is the first Sudanese suspect taken into ICC custody in The Hague. The Court issued an arrest warrant for him in 2007, accusing him of persecution, murder, and rape in the western Sudanese region of Darfur between 2003 and 2004.\n",
      "The UN Security Council referred the situation in Darfur to the ICC in 2002. Kushayb’s transfer – almost 20 years after his alleged crimes – was long overdue and represents an important milestone. But we must not forget the five other arrest warrants related to Darfur that are still outstanding, including that of former Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir.\n",
      "In a landscape fraught with political and procedural obstacles, avenues to justice must be pursued at every opportunity, from local efforts towards truth-telling to international criminal justice proceedings. In these five cases, and despite the COVID-19 crisis, the pursuit of justice has not stopped. PHR and human rights advocates globally are working to build evidence for cases so that victims and survivors can finally obtain their day in court and justice can be served.\n",

      "This post originally appeared in The Huffington Post.\n",
      "This month marks the anniversary of a terrible event: the October 2012 attempt on Dr. Denis Mukwege's life at his home in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). I had just met Dr. Mukwege the previous month following an unforgettable speech at the United Nations, in which he drew attention to the sexual violence crisis in his home country of the DRC and elsewhere. He chastised the international community for its fear and lack of courage in working to end to the practice of using women and girls for sexual slavery and as weapons of war in the DRC. Dr. Mukwege – founder and medical director of Panzi Hospital in eastern DRC – talked about how, having treated tens of thousands of girls and women who were raped in the brutal conflict zone, he could no longer repair their damaged bodies without simultaneously advocating for protection, peace, and justice.\n",
      "Over the past two weeks, I had the privilege of spending additional time in New York with Dr. Mukwege, who is not only my personal hero, but also a dear friend, colleague, and partner of Physicians for Human Rights. Since 2011, we have worked closely with him, his hospital staff, and other partners in the DRC to improve the forensic documentation of evidence of sexual violence in order to end the vicious cycle of mass rape that is fueled by a culture of utter impunity in the DRC. Once again, I was reminded why he is not just an extraordinary physician, but also a remarkable advocate for peace and women's rights.\n",
      "Dr. Mukwege told us about the women and girls, including young children, that he and his colleagues treat at Panzi Hospital in Bukavu. Many of them have been raped by gangs, brutally stabbed or shot in the genitals, with the intention of causing permanent harm to their bodies and lives. The doctors and nurses do all they can, often with great success – restoring their ability to control their bodily functions and – when possible – the potential to conceive children. And despite these heroic efforts, these women sometimes return to their home villages only to be raped again – victims of a cruel weapon of war.\n",
      "Dr. Mukwege has courageously continued his work despite the assassination attempt that took the life of his colleague and bodyguard Joseph Bizimana. Many believe the violent assault was prompted by his U.N. speech, in which he condemned \"the deafening silence and the lack of courage of the international community,\" as well as the lack of political will in his country. This month, Dr. Mukwege has been in the United States to meet with leaders at the highest levels of the United Nations and the U.S. government, and has also humbly accepted several awards, including the 2013 Civil Courage Prize. He dedicates these awards to the courageous women of the DRC. I can't think of anyone more deserving of such an honor. He risks his own life to perform lifesaving medical work and provide a sanctuary for the appalling number of women and girls in the eastern DRC who have been the target of such crimes. His tireless advocacy has been crucial to ensuring that survivors have access not only to medical care, but also to justice and reparations, so that those who commit these brutal acts are held accountable.\n",
      "The numbers are staggering. Since opening in 1999, Panzi Hospital has treated nearly 40,000 survivors of sexual violence. Dr. Mukwege doesn't like to talk about the numbers; instead, he talks about his patients as brave survivors, as only a caring physician could. He wonders when the international community will draw a \"red line\" for the women of the Congo and muster the political will to put an end to this brutal weapon of war that has plagued his country for over 15 years.\n",
      "Despite the seemingly unimaginable situations Dr. Mukwege sees on a daily basis in his work, he is an optimist. Like him, I firmly believe that collectively we can work to address and prevent such human rights violations. As part of the International Campaign to Stop Rape & Gender Violence in Conflict, PHR is calling on political leaders – in the DRC and beyond – to take steps to prevent rape in conflict and protect civilians and rape survivors. We are calling for the full implementation of the Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework Agreement for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the region signed in Addis Ababa in 2013 and for the arrest of those indicted by the International Criminal Court for mass atrocities, including mass rape, in the region. Congolese President Joseph Kabila has also pledged to appoint a special representative to combat sexual violence and the recruitment of child soldiers. While an encouraging development, we must now hold President Kabila to this promise.\n",
      "Just as important is that clinicians like Dr. Mukwege, who bear witness to these human rights abuses, are protected. As gynecological surgeons, he and his colleagues are uniquely skilled to repair the bodies of girls and women who have experienced horrific physical injuries, while also helping to heal their psyches and rebuild the collective well-being of their communities. As a physician and a tenacious leader, Dr. Mukwege has also had the courage to denounce the perpetrators of these crimes and the governments that enable them. All of us, as human beings, can help amplify his powerful call for peace and justice.\n",
      "As Dr. Mukwege said in his U.N. speech in 2012, \"the courage of women victims of sexual violence in the Eastern Congo will, in the end, overcome this evil.\" But let's not allow these brave women and men to stand alone. As the Congolese proverb so poignantly reminds us: \"A single tree doesn't make a forest.\"\n",

      "For Immediate Release\n",
      "In the wake of the U.S. Senate Select Intelligence Committee’s report on CIA torture, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) is calling for accountability for all those who designed, authorized, implemented, and enabled the systematic torture and ill-treatment of detainees.\n",
      "\"Health professionals played a pivotal role in the abuse and brutality exposed in the CIA torture report and they must be held accountable,\" said Dr. Vincent Iacopino, PHR’s senior medical advisor. \"They were complicit at every step, including designing the torture techniques, monitoring the infliction of severe physical and mental pain, and failing to document clear evidence of harm. What happened was unethical, unlawful, and immoral, and we must ensure it never happens again.\"\n",
      "Health professionals' involvement in monitoring the torture techniques was central to providing legal protection to those carrying out the CIA’s program. PHR said the use of doctors and psychologists was the primary means by which the government attempted to justify torture as “safe, legal, and effective.” PHR said that the health professionals who were involved betrayed their ethical duties and profoundly harmed the people they should have been protecting.\n",
      "\"For more than a decade, the U.S. government has been lying about its use of torture,\" said Donna McKay, PHR’s executive director. \"The report confirms that health professionals used their skills to break the minds and bodies of detainees. Their actions destroyed trust in clinicians, undermined the integrity of their professions, and damaged the United States’ human rights record, which can only be corrected through accountability.\"\n",
      "PHR calls for the investigation and prosecution of all those complicit in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees and the revocation of licenses for any health professionals who participated. PHR also repeats its call for transparency, and for the U.S. government to clarify the extent to which U.S. officials and those acting at the government’s direction violated the U.N.

In less than a week, PHR has received credible reports of large-scale airstrikes on at least six hospitals in Daraa in the south of the country, including al-Giza Hospital’s emergency department, which was completely destroyed after being targeted six times.\\nHomer Venters, MD, PHR’s director of programs, said the attacks are continuing with impunity, with catastrophic consequences. We have seen unrelenting bloodshed and a pattern of targeted, deliberate, and cruel attacks on civilians, medical personnel, hospitals, and other health facilities since the start of this conflict. This is taking place against a backdrop of multiple failed attempts by the international community to impose a ceasefire in Syria. As a result, civilians are prevented from getting the medical assistance which they so sorely need,” Venters said.\\n“PHR has documented attacks on health care since the start of the Syria conflict and continues to be gravely concerned about dramatic increases in attacks on civilian health. Ironically, many such attacks happen in so-called de-escalation zones, which is a clear indication of the warring parties’ complete disregard for humanitarian norms and for international law. These attacks on hospitals threaten the lives of thousands of wounded and sick – who already suffer from limited access to shelter, water, and food – and deprive them of essential and life-saving medical care,” Venters added.\\xa0\\nPHR reiterates its urgent call for all parties to the conflict to respect international laws and the core value of medical neutrality, and to refrain from attacking civilians and civilian infrastructure such as medical sites.\\nPhysicians for Human Rights (PHR) is a New York-based advocacy organization that uses science and medicine to prevent mass atrocities and severe human rights violations.

Yet the Trump administration is trumpeting the country’s “success” against the pandemic, with the vice president recently <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/there-isnt-a-coronavirus-second-wave-11592327890?mod=hp_opin_pos_1\">declaring</a> that the U.S. response to Covid-19 is “cause for celebration.”</p>\\n<p>As doctors, we are not celebrating. With more than 125,000 people in the United States <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">dead from Covid-19</a> and new cases climbing in 29 states, this is no time to let down our guard. And while the issue may have faded from the headlines, health workers in many parts of the country <a href=\"https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/comment/ppe-shortage-covid-19/\">still</a> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/mask-shortage-for-most-health-care-workers-extended-into-may-post-ipsos-poll-shows/2020/05/20/1ddbe588-9a21-11ea-ac72-3841fcc9b35f_story.html\">lack</a> <a href=\"https://www.medicaleconomics.com/view/coronavirus-ppe-shortages-expected-continue\">personal protective equipment (PPE)</a>. Doctors’ and nurses’ pleas for masks and gloves may no longer be trending on social media, but the nationwide PPE crisis persists.</p>\\n<p>We have seen colleagues and friends forced to make impossible decisions — putting their own lives at risk to care for Covid-19 patients because they didn’t have the proper protective equipment. Some health workers have <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/490361-hospitals-threatening-to-fire-workers-for-speaking-out-about\">lost their jobs</a> for speaking out about these shortages. The danger is real: At least <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/health/healthcare-workers-death-coronavirus/\">939 health workers have died from Covid-19</a> in the U.S., according to National Nurses United, and this is likely an undercount.

But to date, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has only issued voluntary worker-protection standards in health care settings. This leaves these standards unenforceable. Many complaints about potentially life-threatening safety issues have gone unaddressed.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>it is crucial that Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who serve as chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association, respectively, exercise their leadership to push for universal protections for health care workers across the nation.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>With the Trump administration attempting to simply wish away the pandemic, it’s again up to the states to shape the next phase of our response to Covid-19. Crucially, this includes a responsibility to protect the health workers on the front lines in the weeks and months ahead.</p>\\n<p>This is why thousands of health professionals, <a href=\"https://secure.phr.org/secure/governors-must-act-now-protect-health-care-workers-all-us-states?CID=701f4000001EZBRAA4&amp;ms=FY20_COVID19_NGAAction_Bloomberg&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=Bloomberg&amp;utm_term=06262020&amp;utm_campaign=FY20_Covid\">including our organization, Physicians for Human Rights,</a> are calling on governors in all 50 states to exercise their authority to protect front-line health workers during the pandemic. That means setting clear and enforceable workplace safety standards, and mandating the provision of personal protective equipment. Governors should also enact clear standards for social distancing and hygiene measures, and enhance whistle-blower protections.</p>\\n<p>This week, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/06/24/virginia-safety-rules-covid/?fbclid=IwAR3qeNlZ1eu7KGki8HfWthAGkD213SFX8RCObH9NFNpD3U3biD3E7DM1QbI\">Virginia proposed</a> the country’s first-ever pandemic emergency workplace safety standards — the clearest signal yet of OSHA’s neglect of its duty to protect health workers. The new state regulations are expected to include mandatory guidelines for PPE, sanitation and other workplace safety guidance, as well as protections from retaliation for health workers who speak out about safety concerns. This is an encouraging development, but whether it will save lives depends largely on the state’s enforcement practices.</p>\\n<p>Some states, including Maryland and New York, have OSHA-approved state plans that meet or exceed national standards. That means they can impose stricter safety rules in public health-care facilities, and in some cases private ones, too. In places where there is no state plan, governors and state legislatures must step in and institute emergency standards for worker safety and enforcement that go beyond OSHA’s voluntary measures. OSHA’s non-enforceable standards currently set a very low bar for health worker safety during a pandemic. The states aiming higher will save lives.</p>\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We have seen colleagues and friends forced to make impossible decisions — putting their own lives at risk to care for Covid-19 patients because they didn’t have the proper protective equipment.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Given these gaps, it is crucial that Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who serve as chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association, respectively, exercise their leadership to push for universal protections for health care workers across the nation. States can look to the California model, where there are standards set and generally enforced by the state for social distancing, face masks, hand sanitizing, washing and gloves. California also boasts regular workplace disinfection, increased ventilation and notification of infections.</p>\\n<p>Beyond passing new standards, it is essential that states enforce them. Once issued, relevant state agencies should be mandated to enforce standards under their own authority. States’ attorneys general should likewise be mandated to enforce these standards through the courts. States should also not overlook the critical importance of protecting health workers from discrimination or dismissal for speaking out in the face of dangerous conditions. Likewise, health workers should not face retribution for bringing additional personal protection to their jobs when employers are unable to provide adequate PPE.</p>\\n<p>As physicians, we know that the U.S. is still facing the biggest public health emergency in our lifetimes.

      "Originally published by Bloomberg Opinion \n",
      "The federal government’s response to Covid-19 has been haphazard, mismanaged and ultimately deadly. Yet the Trump administration is trumpeting the country’s “success” against the pandemic, with the vice president recently declaring that the U.S. response to Covid-19 is “cause for celebration.”\n",
      "As doctors, we are not celebrating. With more than 125,000 people in the United States dead from Covid-19 and new cases climbing in 29 states, this is no time to let down our guard. And while the issue may have faded from the headlines, health workers in many parts of the country still lack personal protective equipment (PPE). Doctors’ and nurses’ pleas for masks and gloves may no longer be trending on social media, but the nationwide PPE crisis persists.\n",
      "We have seen colleagues and friends forced to make impossible decisions — putting their own lives at risk to care for Covid-19 patients because they didn’t have the proper protective equipment. Some health workers have lost their jobs for speaking out about these shortages. The danger is real: At least 939 health workers have died from Covid-19 in the U.S., according to National Nurses United, and this is likely an undercount. These deaths were largely preventable.\n",
      "Whether we’re still in the first wave of Covid-19 infections or preparing for the second, this much is true: We cannot abandon medical workers again by not providing the protective equipment they need. But to date, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has only issued voluntary worker-protection standards in health care settings. This leaves these standards unenforceable. Many complaints about potentially life-threatening safety issues have gone unaddressed.\n",
      "it is crucial that Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who serve as chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association, respectively, exercise their leadership to push for universal protections for health care workers across the nation.\n",
      "With the Trump administration attempting to simply wish away the pandemic, it’s again up to the states to shape the next phase of our response to Covid-19. Crucially, this includes a responsibility to protect the health workers on the front lines in the weeks and months ahead.\n",
      "This is why thousands of health professionals, including our organization, Physicians for Human Rights, are calling on governors in all 50 states to exercise their authority to protect front-line health workers during the pandemic. That means setting clear and enforceable workplace safety standards, and mandating the provision of personal protective equipment. Governors should also enact clear standards for social distancing and hygiene measures, and enhance whistle-blower protections.\n",
      "This week, Virginia proposed the country’s first-ever pandemic emergency workplace safety standards — the clearest signal yet of OSHA’s neglect of its duty to protect health workers. The new state regulations are expected to include mandatory guidelines for PPE, sanitation and other workplace safety guidance, as well as protections from retaliation for health workers who speak out about safety concerns. This is an encouraging development, but whether it will save lives depends largely on the state’s enforcement practices.\n",
      "Some states, including Maryland and New York, have OSHA-approved state plans that meet or exceed national standards. That means they can impose stricter safety rules in public health-care facilities, and in some cases private ones, too. In places where there is no state plan, governors and state legislatures must step in and institute emergency standards for worker safety and enforcement that go beyond OSHA’s voluntary measures. OSHA’s non-enforceable standards currently set a very low bar for health worker safety during a pandemic. The states aiming higher will save lives.\n",
      "We have seen colleagues and friends forced to make impossible decisions — putting their own lives at risk to care for Covid-19 patients because they didn’t have the proper protective equipment.\n",
      "Given these gaps, it is crucial that Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who serve as chair and vice-chair of the National Governors Association, respectively, exercise their leadership to push for universal protections for health care workers across the nation. States can look to the California model, where there are standards set and generally enforced by the state for social distancing, face masks, hand sanitizing, washing and gloves. California also boasts regular workplace disinfection, increased ventilation and notification of infections.\n",
      "Beyond passing new standards, it is essential that states enforce them. Once issued, relevant state agencies should be mandated to enforce standards under their own authority. States’ attorneys general should likewise be mandated to enforce these standards through the courts. States should also not overlook the critical importance of protecting health workers from discrimination or dismissal for speaking out in the face of dangerous conditions. Likewise, health workers should not face retribution for bringing additional personal protection to their jobs when employers are unable to provide adequate PPE.\n",
      "As physicians, we know that the U.S. is still facing the biggest public health emergency in our lifetimes. The leadership of governors across the country has been vital in mitigating an even deadlier disaster. As we enter the fifth month of the coronavirus crisis, state-level leaders must rise to meet the moment. That means protecting the health workers who protect all of us.\n"

The Japanese government and three Japanese companies partnered with the Burmese government and a consortium of Burmese companies to develop the site, a project that will require the relocation of nearly 1,000 families in total. PHR’s findings cover phase one of the project, during which 68 households were displaced. PHR performed a survey of 29 of these households and conducted 22 key informant interviews.</p>\\n<p>PHR found that the displacement process fell significantly short of meeting international guidelines, most notably because the residents felt threatened by the government with lawsuits and imprisonment if they did not move. The displacement process in Thilawa violated residents’ human rights, negatively affected their ability to provide for themselves, and resulted in deteriorating food security and limited ability to access health care. The small community PHR sampled during this survey serves as a harbinger of adverse consequences for the additional 846 households that will be displaced during phase two of the Thilawa project. Unless the governments of Japan and Burma achieve a standard of practice consonant with their stated commitment to international norms and guidelines, these 846 households will very likely suffer a fate similar to those affected during phase one.</p>\\n<div class=\"phr-social-share-icons\" id=\"social-share\">\\n<div class=\"phr-social-share-icons__inner\">\\n<a aria-label=\"Share A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma on Facebook\" class=\"social-icon icon-facebook\" href=\"http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://phr.org/our-work/resources/a-foreseeable-disaster-in-burma/\" target=\\'\"_blank\"\\'></a><a aria-label=\"Share A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma on Twitter\" class=\"social-icon icon-twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/share?url=https://phr.org/our-work/resources/a-foreseeable-disaster-in-burma/&amp;text=A%20Foreseeable%20Disaster%20in%20Burma\" target=\\'\"_blank\"\\'></a><a aria-label=\"Share A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma via Email\" class=\"social-icon icon-email\" href=\"mailto:?subject=A%20Foreseeable%20Disaster%20in%20Burma&amp;body=%20https://phr.org/our-work/resources/a-foreseeable-disaster-in-burma/\"></a><a aria-label=\"Print A Foreseeable Disaster in Burma\" class=\"social-icon icon-print phr--print\" href=\"\"></a> </div>\\n</div>\\n</div>'"
