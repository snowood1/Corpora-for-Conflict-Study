      "CHICAGO, United States, March 18 (UNHCR) - During a week-long visit to the United States, the head of the United Nations refugee agency welcomed Washington's longstanding commitment to resettling more refugees than any other country and emphasized that managing the refugee crisis is a global responsibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking on a visit to Chicago, where he met with refugees, US lawmakers and resettlement agencies, UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said: \"Resettlement addresses the needs of the most vulnerable and is the safest way to move people from one country to another. Refugees flee terror, they don't bring terror to countries. Their arrival is very carefully vetted, so there should be no fear.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "War, conflict and persecution have forced around 60 million people worldwide to flee for their lives, the largest number since World War II. Nearly 20 million of these are refugees and more than half are children.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conflict in Syria is the main driver of this global crisis, forcing more than 4.8 million Syrians to become refugees mostly in the neighbouring countries of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Massive refugee flows are a global responsibility,\" said Grandi. \"The tragedy of Syria has shown that this cannot be just the responsibility of two or three countries bordering a country at war - the responsibility has to be shared more widely.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States resettles more refugees than any other country including 90 per cent of African refugees. This year the US plans to resettle 85,000 refugees, including at least 10,000 from the Syria conflict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I hope the United States, along with European countries and others, will continue to increase the numbers of Syrian refugees that they resettle,\" said Grandi. Last year, the United States resettled 70,000 refugees from 70 countries and it plans to increase this number to 100,000 in 2017.\n",
      "\n",
      "While in the Midwestern city, Grandi visited RefugeeOne, a Chicago area non-profit that works with refugees fleeing war, persecution and terror, helping them to build new lives of safety, dignity and self-reliance.\n",
      "\n",

      "\"For me, when I came to the United States in 1994, it was a blessing because Congo has had war for decades,\" said Elias Kasongo, Eli's manager for purchasing and materials, who was first placed to work at the cheesecake company as a cleaner more than 20 years ago.\n",
      "\n",

They are then transported back to their areas of origin.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on a variety of sources well informed about the human rights situation in Colombia, UNHCR concludes that, due to the growing violence and numerous human rights violations that are taking place all across the country, many Colombians who escape abroad are indeed in need of international protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Various irregular armed groups operating in Colombia have a tendency to target anyone suspected of collaborating or sympathizing with an opposing group, without taking into account if this collaboration is real, voluntary or forced. In addition, all these armed groups engage in forced recruitment of young people, including minors, and resort to kidnapping and extortion both as a form of persecution and intimidation as well as to finance their activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the presence of such irregular armed groups throughout the country, UNHCR recommends that when examining asylum claims, it should be taken into account that most Colombians have no possibility of finding safety elsewhere in the country as an alternative to fleeing across an international border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before taking a decision on an asylum application by a Colombian, UNHCR recommends that a thorough analysis of the individual, family and socio-political circumstances be carried out, taking due note of the most recent information available about the situation in Colombia.\n",

      "In recent months, the number of Colombian asylum seekers has risen sharply. In neighbouring countries, the number has climbed by almost 60 percent over last year. And both government and independent sources report a dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced people during the first six months of 2002 - up almost 100 percent compared to the same period last year. So far this year, the total of newly displaced is estimated at between 170,000 and 200,000.

This has most notably been the case in Ukraine with regard to around 25,000 Crimean Tatars forcibly transferred to Central Asia in 1944 and who returned to the Ukraine after the break-up of the former Soviet Union, and in connection with the return of some 60,000 Tajik refugees from Afghanistan.\n",

UNHCR and other humanitarian partners are racing to meet the urgent needs of vulnerable civilians who have arrived at the Al Hol camp in Hassakeh. We are supporting them with immediate shelter, and relief items.\n",

      "More than 10,000 people have fled from the conflict zone to Al Hol camp just in the past week. Since fighting escalated in Hajin in early December, more than 23,000 people have fled to Al Hol, effectively tripling its population. Many more are expected.\n",

On reaching positions of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), they describe being herded into open trucks and having to endure another arduous journey in winter weather northwards to Al Hol camp. Little or no assistance is provided en route to the hungry and cold people, the vast majority of whom are women and children. Since early December at least 29 young children and new-borns died while on their journey or shortly after their arrival. Malnourishment and hypothermia have been the principal causes of death.

      "\n",
      "UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is today reiterating its call to the authorities in Greece to take urgent steps to address the humanitarian situation for around 11,000 asylum-seekers on the islands of Samos and Lesvos. Conditions in the Reception and Identification Centers (RICs) on the two islands are abhorrent. With winter approaching and more people arriving, time is of the essence and emergency measures are needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Efforts to substantially improve conditions and reduce severe overcrowding in the two RICs needs to be prioritized by every government body engaged in the response. It is urgent to get people into better accommodation, and accelerating transfers to the mainland for the more than 4,000 people eligible to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR welcomes recently announced Government plans for an additional 6,000 accommodation places on the mainland, and the Government-led transfer of more than 6,500 people from the islands to the mainland since August. However, more than 11,000 people have arrived to the islands in the last three months, outpacing departures. We are particularly concerned that transfers have recently slowed, while new accommodation on the mainland is in short supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conditions at the RICs have to be seen to be properly comprehended. At the Vathy RIC on Samos, the situation has been worsening. Despite having capacity for 650 people, the centre and its surrounding area are currently hosting around 4,000 people – six times its design. By any measure, things are in crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "New arrivals are left having to buy flimsy tents from local stores, which they are pitching on a steep slope in adjacent fields. This offers little protection from the cold weather, without electricity, running water or toilets. There are snakes in the area, and rats are thriving in the uncollected waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the asylum-seekers arrive in Greece in a vulnerable state, but even those who turn up at the RIC in good condition soon find themselves suffering from health problems. A single doctor per shift provides medical care to the entire population and often only the most urgent cases get seen. Doctors at the local hospital are also overwhelmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the toilets and showers are broken, resulting in open sewage close to people’s tents. Others are using nearby bushes as a toilet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vulnerable asylum-seekers – including some 200 unaccompanied children, over 60 pregnant women, the disabled and survivors of sexual violence – are left at risk in the RIC as alternative accommodation places on the island are taken. A container with broken windows and doors for unaccompanied children is hosting three times its intended capacity of six.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moria RIC on Lesvos still hosts around 6,500 people – over three times its capacity. This is despite recent mainland transfers, and has resulted in nearly 2,000 asylum-seekers having to shelter in a nearby olive grove. Once the weather deteriorates, they will need to seek shelter inside the formal borders of the RIC. With space at such a premium, this is likely to further exacerbate an already agitated situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tension and frustration is rising, particularly over administrative delays. The Moria RIC has become a tinderbox, with any further delays or deterioration in conditions posing a serious threat to the safety of those living and working inside.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other islands, conditions are only marginally better, with the RICs on Chios and Kos close to double their intended capacities. Only the Lepida RIC on Leros Island, where just over 600 people are staying, is working within capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In light of the growing needs on the islands, UNHCR has continued its support to transfers until the end of 2018 and has assisted 5,300 asylum-seekers authorized by the government to move to the mainland since the beginning of September. UNHCR is also procuring 400 prefabricated containers to help boost Greece’s hosting capacity in mainland sites and delivering some 19,000 relief items for the islands, such as winter kits, sleeping bags, winter clothes, and hygiene items. Additionally, UNHCR is expanding its available places in apartment from 25,500 in September to 27,000 by the end of November.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as appealing to the Greek authorities UNHCR is also calling on the European Commission and Member States, to continue preparations for emergency support and relocation measures at the request of the Greek government.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR remains ready to continue supporting the authorities, including with transfers of eligible people to the mainland and enhancing their capacity to address the needs of asylum-seekers and refugees in Greece.\n",

      "A UNHCR assessment team returned yesterday from the Assosa region of western Ethiopia, where refugees have been arriving since late last week amid fighting across the border in Sudan's Blue Nile State. The refugee population has swollen to around 20,000 people, and as our team was there more were arriving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new arrivals have been crossing into Ethiopia mainly through Kurmuk and Gizen, near Sherkole, some 770 kms west of Addis Ababa. Others are crossing through Bamaza, further north.\n",
      "\n",
      "Generally, the physical state of the refugees appears good but they need food, water, and shelter. Some, in the Gizen area, are occupying schools while others are scattered in nearby villages with local families. Those willing to be relocated are being moved to an existing refugee camp at Sherkole. However, most are reluctant to go and prefer to stay near the border, hoping that fighting will die down soon and allow them to return home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first movements of people into the Sherkole camp started on Saturday. The camp was first opened in 1997 in response to the North-South Sudanese civil war. So far, 2,500 refugees have been transferred there.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR has dispatched emergency relief items to Assosa and more supplies are on the way from Addis to assist those at Sherkole and in villages along the border. UNICEF is providing water bladders and medical supplies while WFP is sending food urgently to the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sherkole, which already accommodates some 4,000 Sudanese refugees, can take in a further 6,000 refugees. The Ethiopian government has allocated three new sites at Tongo, Bambasi and Gure, not very far from Sherkole, to accommodate the new arrivals, each with a capacity to accommodate 10,000 refugees. UNHCR has started preparing the sites to receive new arrivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR has sent and is sending out additional staff to the area to more effectively respond to the emergency. Before the emergency occurred Ethiopia has been accommodating more than 26,000 Sudanese refugees in two camps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile in Sudan, we have received reports of tens of thousands of people having fled within Blue Nile State and northwards to Sennar State. We cannot independently confirm the numbers as so far only the Sudanese Red Crescent Society has access to the displaced. They have been able to do an initial assessment and provide limited assistance to the displaced population, although, a number of areas between the towns of Damazine and Kurmuk are not accessible.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNHCR reiterates its call to both the Sudan government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North to end the fighting and allow access for humanitarian staff to address any urgent life-saving needs. We are also calling on both parties to ensure the protection of humanitarian workers and their assets, including warehouses where vital aid has been stored.\n",

      "BRUSSELS/GENEVA – Three UN agencies are calling on European States to increase resources and practical support for their school systems to ensure all refugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children can access and stay in quality education.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a briefing paper published today, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, UNICEF, the United Nations Children’s Fund, and IOM, the International Organization for Migration, detail the obstacles children and adolescents born outside Europe face when trying to access education in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently the number of children and adolescents born outside Europe (including recently arrived refugee and migrant children) who leave school early is nearly twice as high compared to native-born children. Migrant children also have lower learning outcomes when they are not given adequate support. For example, around 3 in 4 native-born students attain proficiency in science, reading and math but only 3 in 5 students with a migrant background do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the key challenges highlighted in the report are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Insufficient financial resources\n",
      "\n",
      "Not enough school spaces or teachers trained to work with refugee and migrant children\n",
      "\n",
      "Language barriers\n",
      "\n",
      "A lack of psychosocial support and limited catch-up classes. The latter are vital for children who have missed extended periods of schooling or have come from different education systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children of pre-primary age (3 to 5 years old) and upper secondary age (15 years and older) are particularly vulnerable to being out of school, as they are often beyond the scope of national legislation on compulsory education.\n",
      "\n",
      "To help States tackle these challenges and address key data gaps, the paper gives examples of good and promising practices in education across Europe and makes a series of recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For refugee children, education is not only vital for their own futures but for the communities in which they live. Quality education boosts life chances, facilitates integration, and is a win-win for the student and society. Investing in education for all is one of the best investments a government can make,” said Pascale Moreau, UNHCR Director of the Bureau for Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brief urges States to strengthen the links between schools and other critical public services, such as health and child protection to ensure that barriers to enrolment and factors contributing to early leaving are addressed. The paper also recommends increasing access to early childhood education services and promoting the integration of young people into upper secondary education and training programmes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“With political will and additional investments, Governments across Europe can build inclusive public-school systems, ensuring all children, regardless of their migration status have their right to an education protected, while building inclusive and successful communities,” said Ms. Afshan Khan, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia and Special Coordinator for the Refugee and Migrant Response in Europe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three agencies also call on States to increase efforts and make further investments at both national and regional level to collect quality standardized and harmonized data on refugee, asylum-seeking and migrant children in education, to inform policy development and allocation of resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Eliminating gaps in refugee and migrant children’s education is critical to their development and well-being and this can have a positive knock-on effect for society in general. Education also has the cohesive power to help refugee and migrant children and their families build links to the local communities and to contribute. Investing in inclusive and quality education will help us to meet our responsibility to ensure that no generation is left behind,” said Manfred Profazi, IOM Senior Regional Adviser for Europe and Central Asia.\n",

      "LONDON/GENEVA, SEPT 3, UNHCR - The UN Refugee Agency, UNHCR today released a report warning that unless immediate and bold action was taken by the international community to beat back the catastrophic effects of COVID-19 on refugee education, the potential of millions of young refugees all over the world would be at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a powerful Final Word to the report, titled “Coming Together for Refugee Education,” the Vodafone Foundation and UNHCR Ambassador for the Instant Network Schools Programme, Mohamed Salah, said ensuring quality education today means less poverty and suffering tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "HERE IS HIS FULL STATEMENT:\n",
      "\n",
      "Around the world, COVID-19 has closed schools and universities. It has emptied offices and hotels, stadiums, cafes, museums, cinemas: almost everywhere we used to gather.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has disrupted not only the education of our children and youth but also the work of those who teach them – and the livelihoods of the parents who do everything they can to pay for books, uniforms and school journeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many refugee children, the vast majority of whom live in the developing world, the coronavirus has added new challenges to lives already torn apart by conflict and persecution. Many may never ever now return to school. Hard-won gains built up slowly and patiently over decades risk being reversed indefinitely. Young lives could be ruined forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "I became the ambassador for the Instant Network Schools programme only days before the coronavirus pandemic radically altered our everyday lives. Delivered in partnership by Vodafone Foundation and UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, INS connects thousands of refugee and host-country students to a quality digital education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of my new role was intended to include visiting the schools supported by the INS programme to raise awareness of the vital importance of quality education for refugee children. Like many other people’s travel plans, mine will have to change.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the INS project – like many of the initiatives highlighted in this report – shows how we can come together in new ways to make a difference to the lives of millions of young people, who more than ever need a helping hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Children who have been uprooted from their homes need books, schools, qualified teachers and more. But they also need the digital technology that connects them to the rest of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "That means better partnerships with the private sector, who are stepping up to create and deliver technology solutions – by providing software, hardware and connectivity. Together, we must also ensure the necessary funding and training to make connected education initiatives linked to national education systems available in all regions of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not just about technology. Every company can make a difference; transport, construction, sport, sanitation, health care and more - getting kids to school, building the classrooms they need, safeguarding their physical and mental well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "I mean apprenticeships and employment opportunities that will give refugees and non-refugees alike something to aim for, and the means to support themselves and their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "In turn, the private sector needs to build on the needs of refugees and the priorities set by their host governments. By also leveraging the capacity and harnessing the aspirations of refugees and hosting communities, along with the expertise and experience of aid agencies, charities, NGOs and others, these projects can be locally owned and made as effective as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring quality education today means less poverty and suffering tomorrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we face this pandemic together, innovation will play a crucial role if the world’s displaced children and youth are not to lose all hope of getting an accredited, quality education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only innovation measured in silicon chips, but bold and imaginative thinking across the board to make that education a reality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless everyone plays their part, generations of children – millions of them in some of the world’s poorest regions – will face a bleak future.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we work as a team, as one, we can give them the chance they deserve to have a dignified future. Let’s not miss this opportunity.\n",

      "While the situation remains volatile in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), UNHCR continues its efforts to assist thousands of internally displaced Congolese. Yesterday, a plane carrying 36 tonnes of relief supplies from our central emergency stockpile in Dubai arrived in Entebbe, Uganda. From there, some 1,500 bales of plastic sheeting and three prefabricated warehouses will be flown to Goma. The rest of the items (3,000 jerry cans, 2,650 plastic sheets, 7,500 blankets and 1,500 kitchen sets) will be moved by road from Entebbe to Bunia, in the DRC. UNHCR has already sent non-food items for some 50,000 people from our regional warehouse in Ngara, Tanzania, by road to the eastern DRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite some shooting reported on Sunday, no major population movements have been reported in Kibati camp on the northern outskirts of Goma. Nevertheless, we remain extremely concerned about the security of some 65,000 internally displaced Congolese civilians in the two Kibati camps. High Commissioner António Guterres again appeals to all sides in the conflict to respect the civilian character of the camps, to respect humanitarian principles and to ensure the safety of civilians and humanitarian workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the influx to Kibati, we have erected six large portable warehouse tents as emergency shelter for some 1,200 people. Earlier plans to expand Kibati are now under reconsideration. The expansion may instead focus on sites to the south-west of Goma, rather than at Kibati. Distribution of non-food aid items such as blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen sets, mosquito nets and jerry cans will start today. This is following WFP's food distribution in the camps, which include four others in the Goma area managed by UNHCR.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are also extremely concerned over the reported displacement of thousands of people in Rutshuru and Kanyabayonga, north of Goma, where access is not possible because of continuing insecurity.\n",

      "\n",
      "https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/briefing/2015/11/564ee87b6/joint-unhcr-iom-unicef-statement-new-border-restrictions-balkans.html\n",
      "In the last couple of days, we have witnessed Governments instituting a range of restrictions against movements of refugees and migrants from Greece through the Western Balkans and further northwards. This includes people being profiled on the basis of nationality. This is becoming increasingly untenable from every point of view - humanitarian, legal, and also safety related, not least in light of falling temperatures and the risks for children and others with specific needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "These measures by States are creating tension at border crossings and a domino effect, leaving in total limbo some refugees and migrants stranded at different border points. UNHCR and IOM have been working with governments to increase reception capacity in the affected countries, and install protection against winter conditions. UNICEF is supporting child friendly spaces in reception centres at border crossings along the Balkan routes, mobilizing for winter and working with governments to strengthen child protection systems for all children including refugee and migrant children.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we remain concerned by a shortage of places to accommodate people along the route should the movement be slowed down and crowding result. We are monitoring and providing assistance with partners at these points, including providing blankets, winter clothing and other key items covering basic needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is urgent need to put in place additional reception capacity at the points of entry, to allow for decent and effective accommodation, compliance with child protection standards, assistance, registration and screening of the thousands of people arriving every day - to identify those who are in need of protection, those to be relocated to other European countries, and people who do not qualify for refugee protection and for whom effective and dignified return mechanisms have to be put in place. In all situations, decisions related to children should be taken guided by what is in their best interests. As long as this robust reception and screening capacity does not exist, the only ones who are in control of the situation are the smuggling networks whose unscrupulous activities have already cost the lives of nearly 3,500 people in the Mediterranean Sea this year. The current situation, if not addressed quickly and comprehensively, will lead to a fragmentation of the routes and additional challenges. Much more has to be done to crack down on smugglers and traffickers - but in ways that allow their victims to be protected.\n",
      "\n",
      "As urgent, is the need to give people uprooted by violent conflicts safe, legal avenues, such as resettlement, humanitarian admission and family reunion, as alternatives to the chaotic and dangerous smuggling routes they are forced to take today to reach safety. UNHCR, IOM and UNICEF therefore call on the concerned States to re-establish coordination and response mechanisms agreed at the Western Balkans Summit on 8 October and the Leaders' Meeting on 25 October 2015.\n",
