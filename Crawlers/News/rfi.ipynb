      "\n",
      "“We are crafty/We are rogues/Not ordinary types,” goes their anthem “Le Boudin” (meaning blood sausage). “Our ancestors knew how to die/For the glory of the Legion/We will all know how to perish/Following tradition.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Foreign Legion was created 190 years ago on 10 March 1831, by King Louis Philippe, to defend French interests in Algeria. The unit was partly composed of foreign deserters and criminals who’d ended up in France after the Napoleonic wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "No fewer than 35,000 legionnaires have died since then, many anonymously, while defending and expanding French colonies during the 19th century, in the two world wars, and in numerous other conflicts.\n",

      "In the last two decades they’ve been deployed to more than a dozen countries, from Bosnia to Congo, Rwanda to Iraq, Somalia to Afghanistan.\n",

      "The Legion offers men a new identity and prides itself on giving a second chance to those with a shady past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The unit still has a reputation as a haven for criminals. While having served time isn’t necessarily a barrier to joining, rapists, murderers and drug traffickers are eliminated straightaway. The Legion is backed up by Interpol, foreign embassies and French intelligence services to weed out unsuitable applicants.\n",

      "And three years into their five-year contract, recruits can apply for French citizenship.\n",
      "\n",
      "That package comes at a price. The selection process is gruesome and only one out of eight candidates gets through. Securing French citizenship meanwhile requires a certificate of good behaviour from the French hierarchy; the slightest foot wrong can ruin your chances.\n",

      "\n",
      "But closed borders due to Covid have led to the number of applicants declining by a third in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When borders are closed, we are not very Covid-compatible,” Lardet acknowledged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parliament was so concerned about the Legion losing its “foreign” DNA that in June 2020 it voted emergency measures to extend the usual age limits and lengths of contract, allowing former legionnaires to be re-recruited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abusive system?\n",
      "\n",
      "While legionnaires have a reputation for being some of the toughest and most disciplined fighters in the world, their image has taken a blow in recent years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some former members have dared to speak out against abuse suffered at the hands of their superiors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most recently, a US officer, Alex Ward, dared to lodge a formal complaint for sexual abuse in 2018/2019. Three officers were punished.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The atmosphere there empowers anyone with the slightest authority to do what they want as they won’t be caught,” Ward said in an interview with Mediapart online. He finally received a residency permit in 2020 but said he remained psychologically scarred by the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another former legionnaire, Alexandre Vinogradov, broke ranks after more than a decade in the service. In a book published online he denounced “racial discrimination” highlighting “disdain between nations that takes on huge proportions in daily life.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The hierarchy keeps saying we bring together more than 150 nationalities and live like one big family, but it’s false and ridiculous,” he wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also criticised the way his brother was denied French citizenship after completing his five-year contract, and left to roam the streets in France as an illegal immigrant for years before finally winning his case in court.\n",

      "\n",
      "As early as 2010, questions were raised over how the linking of French nationality to a certificate of good behaviour could put recruits in a position of extreme vulnerability faced with their commanding officers. A parliamentary report by MP Marylise Lebranchu denounced the “exorbitant power” of the Legion’s hierarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of former legionnaires have since obtained French residency through the courts, helped by Adefdromil, an association defending soldiers’ rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "“These men have no legal existence. We play with their identity,” Adefdromil’s president, Jacques Bessy, told Libération daily. “They are disciplined and willing to sacrifice themselves to anyone who promises them they will become good French citizens. But it hides a sordid reality. It isn’t an elite force, it’s cannon fodder.”\n",
