Pope Francis had invited 191 bishops and clergy to the Synod on the family to speak their minds on issues such as divorce, premarital cohabitation and homosexuality and they did.\\n\\nPope Francis’s invitation to bishops was to “speak clearly. No one must say, ‘this can’t be done.’” This was a big gamble. But the result is a victory for him. True, the final report is markedly less open to the aforementioned “irregular” situations that many had hoped for. But it is also clear that a stable majority of the bishops in Ro...   \n",

Primary votes were 40% Coalition (up one), 38% Labor (down one), 11% Greens (up one) and 2% One Nation (down one).\\n\\nWhile voting intentions moved slightly towards the Coalition, Scott Morrison’s ratings fell to their lowest point since the COVID crisis began. 55% were satisfied with his performance (down seven) and 40% were dissatisfied (up six), for a net approval of +15, down 13 points.\\n\\nAnthony Albanese’s net approval was up one point to +2...   \n",

Amid growing revelations of sexual assaults and toxic workplaces and people taking to the streets to voice their anger and frustration, it’s possible we are finally facing a reckoning on gender relations.\\n\\nBut as we debate — again — how to move into a more equal future, it is also useful to look to our convict past. This has an impact on the issues we face today, and in particular, our idea of masculine norms.\\n\\nMy research with colleagues Victoria Baranov and Ralph De Haas has used data from a unique natural experiment — convi...   \n",

No one must say, ‘this can’t be done.’” This was a big gamble. But the result is a victory for him.

Police were once allowed to testify – with no evidence other than their own notes – that a suspect had made a “verbal confession”, with courts liable to accept the officer’s word against that of the defendant.\\n\\nDuring the 1990s, reforms aiming to prevent this kind of “verballing” (and false accusations of verballing), were brought on by widely publicised investigations such as the Wood Royal Commission.\\n\\nWhat is not so well-...   \n",
