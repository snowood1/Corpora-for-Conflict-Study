And he thinks those rings surrounding Saturn and other planets have been around as long as the solar system itself.\\n\\nAs constant as planetary rings may be, however, they’re also constantly changing. So when Esposito, an astronomer, adds, “All rings are transient,” he’s not contradicting himself.\\n\\nEsposito has witnessed Saturn’s rings change literally before his eyes.
